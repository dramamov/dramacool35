00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.960
Honored officials,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.360
today,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.880
I truly failed to consider this matter fully.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.760
I had thought

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.280
this season was perfect for tasting mushrooms
and enjoying the outdoors.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.480
I never expected

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.640
it would put the Prince in danger.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.480
Please rest assured,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.520
I will immediately send someone

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
to fetch a physician.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.080
For all of you,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.680
after each of you is examined,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.360
you will be escorted home.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.480
Prince,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.160
please stay at my residence tonight.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.200
Once the physician arrives and prescribes medicine,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.800
we will assess the situation.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.760
No need.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.240
Please just have someone escort me home.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
Medicine brewed in Madam Rui's kitchen—

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.440
I dare not drink it either.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.080
You—

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.000
Prince.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.000
Attendants!

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.000
Liang Jin,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.640
go fetch the physician at once.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.200
Be gentle!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.320
Yes, sir.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.880
Prince, please.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.480
Is Zizhai feeling better?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.120
Yes, Aunt.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.000
Prince, be careful.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.680
Don't run so fast.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.560
Hurry up!

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.080
So childish.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.600
How boring, I didn't even scare you.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.080
This suits you.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.000
Wicked fox.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.200
Does it suit me?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.240
Yes, it does.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.640
Look, wicked fox—

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.400
Is this one pretty?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.680
It's pretty.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.320
Boss, we'll take these two masks.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.400
There are so many people.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.480
Hold my sleeve so you don't get lost.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.280
It's fine.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.040
Let's hurry.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.160
There are still so many things.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.680
Let's go!

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.800
Hurry, hurry!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.040
Faster!

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.120
Make way!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.080
Be careful.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720
You wicked fox!

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.320
This is—

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.960
a little rabbit.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.920
Its eyes are both red.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.920
Doesn't it look like you?

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.640
Can't you say something nice

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.760
to cheer me up?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.960
Thank you, wicked fox.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200
It's getting late.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.960
Princess,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.400
you should return to the palace.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.320
Princess,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.520
we should head back.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.360
Let's go.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.960
Can I still visit you at Rui Residence?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.680
As long as it's not to see Third Brother,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.560
I always welcome your visit, Princess.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.800
Got it.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.600
Thank you, Second Young Master Rui.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.200
You were a great help today.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.280
You flatter me, Master.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.040
But—

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.000
the Princess's carriage has already left.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.080
Master, perhaps—

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.920
I'll head off first.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.240
Wait for me!

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.600
Wait for me!

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.200
I messed it up.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.400
It's not your fault.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.240
Ming Qiuhao and the others

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
came prepared.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.520
They can't stand civil and military officials
sitting together.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.680
They insist on smearing the military officers.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.280
When the spy failed to poison,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.600
they deliberately made the Prince

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.040
eat undercooked mushrooms.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.360
Doesn't that mean this banquet...

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.800
Of course not.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.680
Father and General Qiao

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.200
and my colleagues at the Hanlin Academy

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.400
all get along very well.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080
And a few other officials

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.840
have changed their views

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.040
about the military officers.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.480
Isn't there a saying among the people?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.440
One bite

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.880
won't make you fat.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.720
Let's take it slow.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.080
If we promote the Military Imperial Exam,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.440
success is just around the corner.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.440
So, can we...

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.600
Today was exhausting.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.720
Can we go to bed now?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.600
Of course.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.880
Go ahead.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.000
I'll return to my courtyard.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.520
It's rude not to reciprocate.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.920
Come.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.760
I'll walk you back.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.840
No need.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.000
Master Rui, don't refuse.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.720
You are the hero today.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.400
I'll give you a shoulder massage later.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.280
Take a look.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.160
Do you want any of these?

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.920
You don't want any of these?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.280
Lately,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.560
I've been heartbroken by scholars.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.640
I just want to see the wide world.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.520
It'd be best to meet

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.280
a brave man like General of the Cloud Banner.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.280
See if there's anything you want.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.800
If you don't want any,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.640
I'll just throw them all away.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.440
Throw them all away?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.080
What will Princess read in the future?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.800
In the storybooks,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.440
it's all fake and empty.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.000
I want to leave the palace and see the real world.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.640
Wang Guanshan just released a new storybook.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.640
Should I get it for Princess to read?

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.080
What storybook?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.280
Didn't I say before,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.080
except for Pearl Princess,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.720
I don't read any others.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.920
The old Hidden Gazette and Scenery Collection—

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.800
Are they still in the palace?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.080
Xuanbao Pavilion has them all.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.560
Go fetch them for me.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.360
Yes.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.200
Your Highness.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.640
Your Majesty is inside reviewing memorials.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.360
I'm not going in.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.120
I'm just here to bring my royal brother some snacks.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.800
Pan Zi Zhai, what nerve.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.880
He actually dares to ask for Yan Luo's hand.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.520
Your Majesty.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.880
Have some tea.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.320
One says

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.120
he wants to marry Yan Luo.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.880
Another wants Yan Luo to wed Qian Yuan's second prince.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000
Is Qian Yuan really that threatening to me?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.880
Left Minister.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.200
It's also for Ling An.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.080
Left Minister.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.760
Your Majesty.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.880
Don't let anger harm your health.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960
Such wolfish ambition.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800
I might as well

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.080
let Yan Luo marry into Pingxiang.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.560
That way, he won't keep thinking about her.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.120
Your Highness.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.200
Your Highness, where are you going?

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.120
Your Highness.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
Why is Yan Luo outside?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.800
Maybe she just arrived.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.960
Send someone to follow her.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.240
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.440
Yes.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.680
If Princess wants to leave the palace?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.880
Let her go.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.560
Just keep her safe.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.680
Yes.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.080
Take care, sir.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.240
Slow down.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.680
Anyone here?

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.560
Your tiger and wolf wood carving, two qian.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.760
We didn't order this.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.000
You delivered to the wrong place.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.440
Wait a moment.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960
Delivered wrong?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.200
That can't be right.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.360
Let me check.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.000
Look.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.440
Isn't this your place?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
You got the wrong address.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.760
It's not our order.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.560
Sir.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.080
If you don't mind,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200
just take it for me.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.200
Hurry and leave.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.800
How did you know I was here?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.320
Well, I am

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.840
I just asked around.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.800
I'm heading back to Rui Manor now.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.800
Can I go with you?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.280
You snuck out again.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.320
Aren't you worried your brother and mother will worry?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:02.960
I...

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
I just wanted to clear my mind.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.080
What's wrong?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.040
I...

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.680
I might have to marry for alliance.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.280
Marry...

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.800
Go to...

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.080
Is it somewhere far away?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200
I don't know.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.080
But...

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.080
In storybooks, those marriages

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.320
never end well.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.280
And I'm my royal brother's only sister.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.560
Thank you, wicked fox.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.280
Other than Brother Yu,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.200
you're the first to really listen to me.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.320
Oh, right.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.960
You—

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.080
what do you like about Yu?

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.280
Honestly,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.920
he reminds me of the scholar in

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.440
Wang Guanshan's "The Handsome Scholar."

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.920
But now there's a new story about a general.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.560
General of the Cloud Banner.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.040
The scene where he saves the Princess from bandits—

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.800
so heroic!

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.800
The author is truly talented.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.320
Yeah.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.040
Maybe he's a genius.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.560
That's right.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.440
Come on.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.800
I'll take you for a walk by the river.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.920
Let's go.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.080
I shall take my leave.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.320
It's getting late.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.800
Why not just stay here tonight?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.160
Sure.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.200
I'll go get things ready.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.600
What's there to prepare?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.200
Mother has your room cleaned every day.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.840
You can just go to bed.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.080
Madam.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.680
This...

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800
Isn't this improper?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.280
What's wrong with it?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.160
Shouldn't a young couple share a room?

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.440
Why would you sleep apart?

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.800
People might think you're fighting.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.040
You're not fighting, are you?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.320
No.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.200
No, not at all.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.320
Alright.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.080
As your mother, I'll decide.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.200
You'll stay at home tonight.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.440
Hus—

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.720
Husband, do you have anything to add?

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.680
Let Xiaoxiao handle the rest.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.840
You two should rest early.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.320
I'll take your father for a walk to digest.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.320
Got it, Mother.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.320
Rui Yu is frail.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.440
Take good care of him.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.680
Don't overexert yourselves.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.440
You—

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.920
Mother, what are you saying?

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.560
You just have to get the hint, right?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.480
Yes, yes, Madam, you're right.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.160
Well...

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.320
I...

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.560
Let me take you somewhere.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.480
Okay.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.080
Be careful not to catch a chill.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.080
I'm not that weak!

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.680
I was just pretending before.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400
To a martial artist,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.560
your small frame—

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.680
even a punch's wind

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.040
could knock you down.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.480
My mother loves gardening.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.400
So my father built

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.600
a garden pavilion for her here.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.440
The garden's layout is unique.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.680
Father really put his heart into it.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.680
And

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.680
the flowers are all beautiful.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.480
When I was little,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.800
I accidentally killed a peony.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.440
It was Mother's favorite.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.800
Mother,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.200
I let this flower die.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.440
When she found out,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.440
she was sad for a long time.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.200
Let's grow another one.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.680
Madam.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680
Father saw it.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.920
He chased me with a broom.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.200
I'll teach you a lesson today!

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.200
Don't run!

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.680
Stop hitting!

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.560
Sir!

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.200
Don't run, don't run!

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.200
What are you doing, sir?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200
Father chased me around.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.440
Don't hit him!

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.280
Sir!

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.200
Then Mother saw me crying.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.200
She cried even harder.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.400
Stop your nonsense!

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.680
Not working, is it?

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.200
You really are something.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.440
It works, it works.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.480
Mother.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.960
Where does it hurt?

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.560
Father really cares about Mother.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.320
But...

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.840
Why do you always cause trouble?

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.560
As a child, I hated pretending to be a girl.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.200
It made Mother worry every day.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.320
Later, she became absent-minded.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.560
She thought she really had a daughter.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.680
She taught me needlework,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.400
tea brewing,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.320
and all sorts of things.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.440
Yu,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.440
look at that fish pond.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.080
I remember

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.320
when I was eight,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280
I got mad at my father

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.040
and ate all the fish in it.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.160
He was so angry, he gave me a beating.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.560
I couldn't get out of bed for three days.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.480
And...

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
Why are you laughing?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.200
I'm laughing

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.560
because you're so mischievous and cute.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.800
Your childhood must've been fun.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.440
Did you have any fun stories as a child?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.560
I...

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.200
You were born into a scholarly family,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.800
and your older brothers are interesting.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.680
You must've been happy too.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.600
I...

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.200
When I was very young,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.400
my mother passed away.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.160
In my memory,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.080
my father always had

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.800
a stern, unsmiling face.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.040
So,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.160
there weren't really any fun stories.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.200
I just remember being in the study

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.440
reading book after book.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.800
It felt endless.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.720
Naturally,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.320
I rarely spoke with my brothers.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.280
Later on,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.560
Your Majesty granted our marriage.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.800
So I married you.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.080
Looking back now,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.960
it all feels like a dream.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.240
You

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.720
Be careful not to fall.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.000
I know.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.480
But speaking of it,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.680
seeing from such a height

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.200
really gives a different view.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.360
I've made up my mind.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.600
I don't want to be just your brother.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.760
Nor do I want us to be strangers.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.640
I want us to be a real married couple.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.840
Like my father and mother,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.440
loving each other till old age.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.000
I...

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.720
Say something, will you?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.680
Do you think I haven't done well enough,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.360
or are you unhappy with me?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440
N-no.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.680
No.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680
I'm not.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.440
I just feel

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.400
it's not the right time yet.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.480
I...

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.280
I'm not ready yet.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.520
I also...

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.000
don't know what to do.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.400
If you can't say no,

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.280
then let's just stay like this.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.440
It doesn't seem so bad.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.840
You don't need to do anything.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.120
Leave everything to me.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:54.960
If that's the case,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.400
are you willing?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.960
Then...

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.200
Then...

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.640
I'll try.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.200
The full moon is in two days.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.960
Look.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.200
It's beautiful.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.000
Mother picked the softest quilt for you.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.520
She even fluffed new cotton.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.680
The weather has changed now.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680
The night is cold and damp.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.640
With this quilt, you won't catch cold.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.360
Mother is so thoughtful.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.440
Do you need anything else?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.720
I'll go tell Mother.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.240
No need to trouble yourself.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.360
The moon is lovely tonight.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.880
Why aren't you done yet?

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.680
Finish and leave quickly.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.440
Yes, yes.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.680
I just remembered.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.720
Madam just said

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.840
you should go talk with her in her room.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.000
Then go keep Mother company.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.680
Is that true?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.760
Really.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.640
Alright then.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.640
I'll go check first.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.520
Go, go.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.360
Did you make it up, or did Mother really call me?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.520
Of course I made it up.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.000
That's good.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.440
Go on with your work.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.960
Are you staying?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.600
At least you're married in name.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.520
It's just...

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.240
It's not right to leave her alone here.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.200
Didn't you two sleep separately before?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.160
Mother.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.960
Greetings, Madam.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.640
Fulu.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.160
Why are you still here?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.840
I...

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.040
Um...

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.360
Fulu said you missed me.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440
and wanted me to come to your room

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.680
to talk privately with you.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.600
I was just about to come see you.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.160
When did I ever say that?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.480
Even if I miss you,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.120
you can't leave your husband alone in the room.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.880
You've only been married a few months.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.680
What would people think if they heard?

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.400
Go inside, quickly.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.120
Uh...

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
Isn't this inappropriate?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.640
What's wrong with it?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.000
Just go in, hurry.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.240
Listen to Mother and go in.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.680
You should go to bed too.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.160
I still have to guard the door.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.920
Guard what door?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:07.720
Well...

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.680
You never had to guard before.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.880
Go on, go to sleep.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.160
Yes.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.040
Let's go.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.880
What's going on?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.120
Prince.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:52.920
Let's go.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.280
Prince, Prince!

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.280
I arrived late.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.040
It's fine.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.640
Turn around.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.400
Why didn't you...

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.680
I just finished talking with Mother.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.440
Just got back.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.760
Then tonight,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.280
I'll sleep on the couch.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.160
Why sleep on the couch when there's a bed?

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.200
Uh...

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.240
It's your room, after all.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.680
Before,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.880
you always slept on the couch.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.640
It's not right to make you sleep there forever.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.400
If you're not sleepy,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.440
let's

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.000
chat for a while.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.640
Sure.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.160
Why are you tongue-tied all of a sudden?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.920
Where did your confession courage go?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:57.960
Prince.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.360
Did you get anything out of them?

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.640
They all took poison and killed themselves.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.040
But I saw on their abdomens

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.600
the Qian Yuan totem.
