[The Sparrow's Gambit]

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
[Episode 13]

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.900
Rumeng,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.460
I know you've suffered many grievances

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.420
since entering the Wang family.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.580
Set your mind at ease.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.780
Once you are formally married,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.060
I will protect you.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.180
Okay.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.100
Rumeng,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.140
what's wrong?

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.420
Rumeng?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.420
Rumeng?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.500
Rumeng?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.300
Room 904. Have fun.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.100
After tonight,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.780
you'll understand I'm better than her.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.780
By now,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.660
she should already be with Mr. Li.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.260
What did you say?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.700
Wenbin.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.020
Rumeng! Rumeng!

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.220
Here I come, babe!

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.620
Come on, babe!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.020
With my strength alone,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.180
I could never expose their crimes.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.060
Babe,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.300
here I come!

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.300
Mr. Wang.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.260
Mr. Li.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.940
So,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.100
did you enjoy yourself earlier?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.300
Man,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.620
you really went all out.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.500
Don't worry.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.900
From now on, you can count on me

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.300
for anything the Wang family needs.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.780
Mr. Li,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.980
then I would like

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.380
to thank you verbally.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.700
I'll send you a generous package later.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.020
We're all family now.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.980
Wang Penghui, do you even
see me as your daughter?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.180
You handed me over to someone else
like livestock?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.660
Are you even human?

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.180
All these years,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.700
haven't I done every dirty,
difficult job

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.860
for the Wang family?

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.020
What are you talking about?

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.220
You gave me

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.340
to such

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.100
an old scumbag?

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.860
Mr. Wang,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700
this is your daughter!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.100
She can't just make wild accusations!

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.700
She's slandering me
in front of all these people!

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
You couldn't get back into the Chamber,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.260
so this is your pathetic move?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.580
Everyone, my conscience is clear.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.900
I fear no false accusations.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.700
This filthy woman must have

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.260
been fooling around with some other man

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.700
and now wants me to take the blame.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.660
Let me tell you,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.020
dream on!

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.780
Nonsense!

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.500
You're all hypocrites!

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.580
So-called pillars
of the business community!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.300
You dare to do it but won't admit it,
is that it?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.020
Wan'er,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.060
could there be some misunderstanding?

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.260
You...

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.100
Misunderstanding?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.940
It should have been you!

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.180
You arranged all of this!

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.940
I'll kill you!

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.420
Guards!

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.020
To think she'd stoop
to outright violence!

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.900
Let me go!

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.540
Mr. Wang,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.420
regarding today's incident...

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.300
I know.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.180
Once the Military Governor Chen returns,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.780
I will personally come to apologize.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.180
You've completely humiliated me today.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.900
Go home

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.580
and kneel

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.540
until I am satisfied.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.300
Are you okay?

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.100
So you're determined

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.740
to marry into the Wang family?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.260
Yes.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.380
Please leave.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.980
Don't make me hate you.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.620
I'll kill you!

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.140
Rumeng.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.620
What a farce today.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.460
Yes.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.740
A farce.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.500
You weren't hurt, were you?

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.020
No.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.540
No...

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.620
That's good.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.020
But there's something
I want to ask you now.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.220
Where were you
when Wan'er had her incident?

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.380
Where was I?

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.740
Shouldn't you know best?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.620
Then why did I hear

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.300
Chen Wenbin was with you?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.180
What was in the wine?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.740
You know perfectly well.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.020
What Marshal Chen was doing,

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.580
and where he was...

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.700
How would I, in my dazed state,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.020
have any idea?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.300
Can you tell the truth?

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.740
The truth! Tell the truth!

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.100
Your eagerness
to marry off your daughter...

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.180
I understand.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.020
But you sent Wang Wan'er
to lure me to a hotel

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.140
and drug me with incense.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.180
That was a rather despicable tactic,
wasn't it?

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.020
Wang Penghui,

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.780
the Chen family values integrity
and character above all.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.340
I advise you

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.180
to discipline your daughter properly.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.340
Don't worry, Marshal Chen.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.220
I've already made that fool
kneel in punishment.
