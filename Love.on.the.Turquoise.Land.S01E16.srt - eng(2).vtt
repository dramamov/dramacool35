=Episode 16=

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.330
Fourth Brother, look over there.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.370
Oh, my.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:39.009
Really?

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.090
I've been worried about this for days.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.129
Thank you. I can't thank you enough.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.009
Okay.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.409
Bye then. Sure.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.370
Thank you.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.609
Goodbye.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.250
I'm sorry, Mr. Yan.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:56.810
Calls keep coming.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.050
Family troubles.

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.449
No problem, Mr. Meng.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.090
We're here to relax.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.849
You rarely visit Xicang.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.370
Let's have dinner tonight.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.050
Sorry.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.930
I need to return to Heyang tonight.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.210
My child is sick.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.090
I see.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.849
Earlier,

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.129
the International Children's Hospital
called

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.169
and said they have an available bed now.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.129
My son can transfer there soon.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.930
He's been in general wards before,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.930
so suffering.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.650
Right.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.129
Good then.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.849
I've booked provincial experts.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.250
Once the treatment plan's out,

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:31.569
your child's rehabilitation

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.409
will be secured.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.129
Rest assured.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.849
You arranged this?

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:39.849
No big deal. It's nothing.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.770
Mr. Yan, you really...

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.770
I failed to host you properly in Heyang.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.569
Now I'm in Xicang.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.289
You helped me tremendously. Well...

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.129
How do I repay you?

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.689
Don't.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.650
No need, Mr. Meng.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.770
I've been thinking.

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.970
If your herbal extraction technology

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.289
needs proper development,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.009
you must need a partner

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.050
that offers both funding

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.530
and high-quality raw materials.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.930
As far as I know,

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.810
you've talked with us Roadsound,

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.770
also contacted Mr. Liu

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.889
from Botong Group

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.650
and Mr. Wu from Xinyang Pharmacy.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.049
I know.

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:20.090
This technology

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.609
took you and your team

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.210
nine years to develop.

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:25.609
Comparing options carefully

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:26.729
is always wise.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.049
But when you were on calls,

00:04:29.049 --> 00:04:29.970
you might've missed

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.809
a fish took your bait.

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:36.690
If you miss this chance,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.169
you might

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.369
never get another big catch.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.169
Mr. Yan,

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.409
aren't we here to relax?

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:49.890
Yes.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.489
Isn't that relaxing

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:53.210
to fish

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:54.970
while negotiating deals?

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.210
Take a look.

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.194
(Investment Cooperation Contract)

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:12.929
So I was the fish took your bait.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.929
Mr. Meng,

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:17.729
Roadsound's respect and sincerity

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:19.770
are reflected in the terms.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.289
You'll definitely feel it.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.770
I can tell

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.890
our cooperation

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.729
will be extremely fruitful.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.970
Thank you.

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.450
Actually,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.849
besides this project,

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:36.409
I'm in charge of

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.970
Roadsound Group's operations.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.729
Any further problems,

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:41.210
just contact me directly.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.489
No need to bypass me

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.650
and bother Ms. Lin.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.090
Agreed.

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.530
Sorry about the last time.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.130
It caused you trouble.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.809
Not at all.

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:51.289
I know you meant well.

00:05:51.888 --> 00:05:54.800
- May our collaboration go well.
- Likewise.

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.409
Fourth Brother,
we have a crowbar in the car.

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:19.729
Bring it here.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.369
Can you open it?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.450
Careful.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.369
Try it.

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:34.570
Water?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.169
No, thanks.

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.210
Thank you.

00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:02.130
Not at all, Ms. Lin. It's my duty.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.130
We retrieved the body from the water.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.450
He was stuffed in the trunk.

00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:32.570
And the car was soaked.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.530
So no traces could be found.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:58.049
(Top of the skull. Stabbed by a blade.
Four and a half inches deep.)

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:05.690
It's the Mad Blade.

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:40.050
You said the Mad Blade had no successor.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.529
And your trump card is gone.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.810
Yet one of our comrades
died by the Mad Blade.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.009
Mr. Jiang.

00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:48.410
The South Mountain Hunters
have survived till today

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:50.970
through deception, despicable means,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.009
and lies, I suppose.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:58.529
I...

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:01.210
I didn't lie.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.450
Mad Blade died,

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:06.410
so did his skill.

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:10.529
But the blade

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:14.050
is in someone's hands.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.810
Half-truths

00:09:19.609 --> 00:09:20.729
are still lies.

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:23.489
After years in business,

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:25.970
I've learned something.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.210
Cooperation

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.810
can only be achieved by mutual consent.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.170
So I'll stop here.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.050
Mr. Jiang,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.729
I want to hear your version.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.410
D-Do you know why

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:02.570
w-we call you

00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:05.529
Earth Fiends?

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.970
Fiends

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.729
mean evil birds.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.609
They devour their mother.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.210
Emperors sought to exterminate them,

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.729
ordering officials to hunt them down

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.729
and display their carcasses
on branches as warnings.

00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:37.609
Through the ages,

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:39.970
you've always been

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.210
universally despised,

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:50.570
heartless scum.

00:11:01.249 --> 00:11:02.570
Scum!

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.129
Am...

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.009
Am I heartless?

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:32.369
What you've done

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.970
is all for our comrades
to come to light again.

00:11:36.649 --> 00:11:38.090
Your kindness to us

00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:41.330
can't be measured
by an ordinary standard.

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:48.649
Did Feng Mi find the one who tampered

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:49.729
with surveillance?

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.849
Sorry, Ms. Lin. Not yet.

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:53.729
I can't figure out

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.849
why Han Guan and Chen Fu got exposed.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.249
They never step out of line.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.769
Outsiders couldn't notice them.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.050
You mean,

00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:03.729
if not outsiders,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.129
then it's among us?

00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:09.330
Even with my great compassion,

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.609
I can't earn mutual understanding.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.970
If Li Yueying could harm Qin Chi,

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.369
she might betray others too.

00:12:16.609 --> 00:12:18.249
You have Jiang Baichuan's phone, right?

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:18.769
Yes.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:18.970
Scum!

If you want to rescue him,

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:31.889
bring us Mad Blade.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.649
Tell us

00:13:59.170 --> 00:13:59.889
what to do.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.649
Shen, we'll do as you say.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.330
Send me the video.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.170
Then what?

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.970
Stay put.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.489
Wait for my return.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.290
Relax your shoulders.

00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:07.290
Steady.

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:09.649
Breathe in.

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:11.369
Hold it.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.769
Pull the trigger.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.009
You have potential,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.970
but to achieve results,

00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:20.649
first clarify your target.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.369
I've followed Jiang since my twenties.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.529
He always decided for me.

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:34.330
Where I go,

00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:36.129
what I do,

00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:39.170
and how I act.

00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:44.849
I'm afraid you'd look down on me,

00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:47.450
and think I am like

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:50.369
a mindless puppet without Jiang.

00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:53.970
But except being anxious,

00:16:56.609 --> 00:16:58.529
I can do nothing else.

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.049
In the South Mountain base,

00:17:12.009 --> 00:17:13.249
everyone is anxious.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.130
But we must do things step by step.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.930
Aim at the target.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.450
Opportunities will come.

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:48.130
Scum!

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.809
If you want to rescue him,
bring us Mad Blade.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.170
She said her man was killed
by Mad Blade.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.809
I didn't properly dispose
of the Earth Fiend I killed.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.650
It's all my fault.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.450
Stop it.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.930
Jiang held firm.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.729
Didn't reveal anything
that could harm us.

00:18:22.729 --> 00:18:24.809
But we can't let him bear this alone.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.170
What's your plan?

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.809
Since she demanded Mad Blade,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.809
I'll go confront them.

00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:34.729
No.

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:36.289
I'll go inform everyone,

00:18:36.569 --> 00:18:37.729
and then we'll plan our move.

00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:38.690
Lin Xirou doesn't know

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.370
I know where she's trapping Jiang.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.049
She sent this video now

00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:43.170
to provoke us

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.410
and go negotiate with her.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.329
If we act rashly,

00:18:47.489 --> 00:18:48.729
we will fall into her trap.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:55.850
What's your plan then?

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:01.249
I'll go alone

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.289
by stealth.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.970
(Rare Stone Garden)
We guard here

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.170
day and night,

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:17.690
without even knowing why.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.970
Keep your voice down.

00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:23.569
If Xiong hears you,

00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:24.690
we'll both be in trouble.

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:31.370
Lend me your lighter.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.370
Are you okay?

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.850
One point five. Head at one point three.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.210
Flank rear. Diagonal downward.
Reverse elbow at two,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.049
and lift.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.089
We're just workers, really.

00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:43.089
Make a living.

00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:44.089
W-We don't know anything.

00:20:44.249 --> 00:20:45.450
Haven't done anything wrong.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.249
Who were you guarding here?

00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:49.130
A-An old man.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.410
Where is he now?

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.170
Got taken away two days ago.

00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:53.809
They told me to keep watch.

00:20:54.329 --> 00:20:56.569
I get paid, so I didn't ask questions.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.049
What condition was he in when taken?

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:00.970
Looked like he'd suffered a lot,

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.610
but still had some fight.

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:03.850
Could walk out on his own.

00:21:06.089 --> 00:21:08.529
Heroes, we know the rules.

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:09.249
We didn't know

00:21:09.249 --> 00:21:10.529
what you look like at all.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.650
We're just gatekeepers.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.610
Please show mercy.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.809
Spare us, please.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.009
Please spare us.

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:19.210
Please spare us.

00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:34.489
A man and a woman,

00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:35.970
both highly skilled.

00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:37.650
They must

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.130
be the South Mountain people.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.170
How did they

00:21:43.729 --> 00:21:45.610
find Rare Stone Garden?

00:21:47.249 --> 00:21:50.130
I did host clients there before.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.890
My mistake.

00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:55.130
Should've chosen a more secure location.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.210
Fortunately you anticipated this

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.410
and transferred
Jiang Baichuan in advance.

00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:06.289
First Han Guan and Chen Fu disappeared,

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.370
now they found Rare Stone Garden.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.049
Though I hate to admit it,

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:18.089
it's certain...

00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:21.370
We have a traitor among us.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.450
What about the investigation?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.529
Got something.

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:29.690
I'll send you the video.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.569
Ms. Lin.

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:35.370
I'm back.

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:38.769
How's the talk with Mr. Meng?

00:22:41.249 --> 00:22:42.249
He took the bait.

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:44.650
He accepted almost all the terms,

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:46.529
and stamped the documents.

00:22:46.529 --> 00:22:47.690
Waiting for your signature.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.329
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.890
Another big achievement.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.249
Compared to your concerns,

00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:55.370
this is nothing.

00:22:55.489 --> 00:22:56.809
I handled it while fishing.

00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:58.809
Don't downplay your efforts.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.729
Didn't you also make a trip to Heyang?

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:07.729
Stop teasing me about it.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.410
I know drinking affects work.
I promise it never happens again.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.170
Net friend, right?

00:23:15.009 --> 00:23:16.850
Went to Heyang to meet a net friend.

00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:29.329
Right.

00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:32.529
We chat on a dating app.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.610
I'm sorry, Ms. Lin.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.690
I've been too playful lately.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.170
Young people should
have fun while they can.

00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:51.690
Yes.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.130
Feng Mi.

00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:56.930
She's quite playful.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.329
She's been cooped up with me
since arriving in Xicang.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.809
Tuo.

00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:03.529
Take Feng Mi around for fun.

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:06.289
Mr. Yan, thank you.

00:24:08.529 --> 00:24:09.370
Right now?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.130
Seize the day.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.650
What are you doing?

00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:25.729
To have fun.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.489
Ms. Lin just said it.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.729
Let me think.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.850
I'll check it out.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.650
I need to entertain you

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.930
(Luo: Jiang is in trouble.)
properly.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.370
Checked it out?

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.850
Let's go. I'll take you to relax.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.249
Come on.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.529
Didn't you say to take me to relax?

00:24:55.009 --> 00:24:56.489
Isn't car washing relaxing enough?

00:24:56.489 --> 00:24:57.450
So soothing.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.190
Come on.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.529
Let me tell you.

00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:03.410
The most soothing thing in this world

00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:04.850
is to wash your own car

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.370
on your own.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.089
To be honest,

00:25:08.569 --> 00:25:09.610
I've never shared this

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.170
with anyone before.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.890
Let's begin.

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:28.249
(Not available now.)

00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:29.450
Am I doing it right?

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:31.089
Yes. Exactly.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.890
(Not available now. Chat later.)

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.930
I want one too.

00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:54.930
Don't you open it for me?

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.489
Your place feels so empty.

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:05.850
Nothing fun here at all.

00:26:07.729 --> 00:26:08.970
Plenty of fun outside.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.170
You should go out and enjoy.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.009
No need.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.610
You're fun enough.

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.529
Hungry?

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.729
Eat something?

00:26:37.089 --> 00:26:38.610
My food is all in the fridge.

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.170
Or order delivery yourself?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.410
Can't I eat your food too?

00:26:45.569 --> 00:26:46.610
You might not like it.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.690
I have to try first.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.170
Alright.

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:55.370
Then you cook for me.

00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:58.089
Boil chicken breast, sweet potato, oats,

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:58.890
and broccoli.

00:26:59.024 --> 00:27:00.176
Make one for yourself too.

00:27:00.176 --> 00:27:00.890
Excuse me.

00:27:25.009 --> 00:27:26.289
I need to empty the bowels.

00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:27.529
Look forward to your meal.

00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:38.089
(What happened?)

00:27:43.249 --> 00:27:44.249
How to cook?

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:48.049
To boil everything.

00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:49.170
All together?

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:49.690
(Long story.)

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.569
(Too many things.)

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.970
That'd be mush.

00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:54.650
Cook them separately.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.970
(Ms. Lin is alert now.)

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.329
Such a hassle.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.370
How long to cook then?

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.569
Until they're done.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.650
(Ms. Lin is alert now.)

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.249
(She sent Feng Mi to follow me.)

00:28:12.729 --> 00:28:13.930
(What to do then?)

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.930
Enough. Stop it.

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.489
Let's just eat out.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.130
Great. Where to?

00:28:29.009 --> 00:28:31.650
Fusion cuisine.
At Mucheng branch of Miya Kitchen.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.009
Book table 4C for me.

00:28:34.009 --> 00:28:35.249
That's my regular spot.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.850
(See you later.)

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:55.489
You'd order. Whatever you like.

00:28:57.809 --> 00:28:58.489
Take it.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.130
What's wrong?

00:29:04.569 --> 00:29:06.569
Treat me to a meal for no reason...

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:09.410
W-What a Greek gift...

00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:14.930
I bet there's a big trouble.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.690
Spit it out.

00:29:16.729 --> 00:29:18.009
Or I can't eat at ease.

00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:19.370
Just treating you to dinner.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:20.450
Why so suspicious?

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.089
Nice place. Bring girls here often?

00:29:35.089 --> 00:29:35.650
Not at all.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.489
I'd like to order.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.049
See what you want to eat.

00:29:52.329 --> 00:29:54.130
I'll have this. Rare, please.

00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:56.450
Okay. Rare Angus rib eye.

00:29:57.089 --> 00:29:57.930
And you, Sir?

00:29:58.809 --> 00:29:59.410
Seafood salad.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.009
Actually...

00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:00.809
Okay.

00:30:08.729 --> 00:30:10.329
Actually...

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.809
I...

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.170
It's fine. I can handle it.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:13.769
Go ahead.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.370
Well,

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.569
I've already been there

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.690
and found nothing.

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:23.650
Where?

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.809
Deep inside.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.610
You

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.850
found nothing

00:30:32.729 --> 00:30:33.489
deep inside?

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.049
Regarding creation,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.489
I feel like I've hit a dead end.

00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:42.769
They...

00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:45.489
They must have taken it away.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.130
What?

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.850
I thought you don't drink.

00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:51.329
They took the wine glass away.

00:30:51.329 --> 00:30:52.289
W-Withdrew it.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.930
Didn't you say you won't drink?

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.049
Let them get it back?

00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:55.690
No need.

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:56.890
I'm driving. Water's fine.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.089
Weren't you always so resolute?

00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:02.410
Ashamed of commercial operations.

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:03.769
Devoted to creation.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.769
Why did you

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.130
find nothing?

00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:11.970
I think we need to take initiative.

00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:14.410
Don't scare me.

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:16.049
You have a list, right?

00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:17.089
What list?

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:19.370
The one that's crucial to you.

00:31:21.489 --> 00:31:24.170
Top 10 Ninja Duck skins list?

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.970
Yes, exactly.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.850
Track down everyone on it.

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.930
Everyone?

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.089
Ma'am, your Angus rib eye.

00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:37.769
Rare.

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:44.370
This is

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:46.610
too risky.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.569
What's wrong?

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.329
It is so raw. Aren't you
worried about parasites?

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:55.610
It's rare that you treat me to meals.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.930
Parasites don't matter.

00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:59.049
I'd eat even with cockroaches.

00:32:03.249 --> 00:32:04.489
Insane.

00:32:05.009 --> 00:32:06.089
Insane.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.850
Let's suspend Hermit Duck then.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.210
Suspend?

00:32:09.569 --> 00:32:11.089
Listen, we can expand revenue,

00:32:11.089 --> 00:32:12.410
but never cut costs.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.170
We can't block all of our retreats.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.210
If new works aren't accepted

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.569
and old ones suspended,

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:18.769
we'll both doom.

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:20.970
What about that rich kid?

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.130
Didn't he cover all costs?

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.850
I can eat it raw.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.289
This shows someone likes it.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.489
Do you truly believe

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.170
that rich kid understands art?

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:33.249
He's just bored
with models and influencers,

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:36.049
and seeking
a refined female artist like you

00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:37.690
to get new fun.

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:38.890
Didn't notice that?

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.130
Seems zero evolution to me.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.370
Right?

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.489
When you tricked me into meeting him,

00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:44.690
your story was different.

00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:46.970
I didn't trick you.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.690
Here's

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:50.650
your extra-stinky smelly mandarin fish.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.370
Three rice bowls, please.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.049
Need to eat more.

00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.769
I might go broke.

00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:56.130
Seafood salad. Enjoy.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.529
That's the right spirit.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.610
Push yourselves to the brink

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.170
to find hope in desperation.

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:02.850
Find hope in desperation?

00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:04.569
Born in wrong times, I guess.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.000
How many girls have you dated?

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:07.610
Three.

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:08.930
Three?

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.329
You only had

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.850
three girlfriends?

00:33:12.249 --> 00:33:12.970
What's wrong?

00:33:14.289 --> 00:33:15.329
So,

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.809
you seem like a playboy

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.729
but actually a spoony?

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:20.970
Kind of.

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:23.450
What about me?

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:24.850
What do you think of me?

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:32.890
This

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:35.690
can't be done by the two of us.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.049
The two of us?

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.130
Do what?

00:33:39.489 --> 00:33:40.130
I need help.

00:33:41.009 --> 00:33:41.809
Help?

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.289
Right. I'm quite reserved.

00:33:45.584 --> 00:33:47.249
I never start a relationship by my own.

00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:48.850
So I need a middle man.

00:33:52.049 --> 00:33:55.130
Actually, I have
a trustworthy candidate in mind.

00:33:55.489 --> 00:33:56.210
What do you mean?

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.089
If possible,

00:33:58.089 --> 00:33:59.410
I can help you two connect first.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.450
Are you sure?

00:34:05.249 --> 00:34:05.850
Yes.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.289
No problem. I trust you.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.410
So after all this,

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:13.850
all this roundabout talk,

00:34:14.049 --> 00:34:15.850
you want to break our contract?

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:17.489
You found

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.529
a sweet talker?

00:34:20.569 --> 00:34:22.370
Listen, I'll make the introduction

00:34:23.049 --> 00:34:24.290
and help you two connect.

00:34:24.689 --> 00:34:27.250
He's the Mad Dog,
curator of the art gallery.

00:34:28.209 --> 00:34:28.890
No way.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:32.250
Just take the new series. I don't care.

00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:33.890
Ninja Duck is mine.

00:34:34.049 --> 00:34:35.850
No one can share this with me.

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:37.890
Listen,

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:39.730
our exclusive contract
hasn't expired yet.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.649
I don't care

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:42.410
about any Mad Dog or Crazy Hound.

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:44.890
Don't you think
talking something like this

00:34:45.529 --> 00:34:46.890
to me now is kind of ugly?

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:50.770
Listen.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.770
First target Ms. Lin.

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.810
Figure out a way.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:56.410
Fine.

00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:57.770
Let's eat first.

00:35:04.209 --> 00:35:05.890
Instead of the pennies at their feet,

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:07.609
an artist's eye

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.890
is on the moon.

00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:11.009
I'm puzzled.

00:35:11.529 --> 00:35:12.129
Can't we first

00:35:12.129 --> 00:35:13.689
gather the pennies

00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:15.569
before looking up at the moon?

00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:18.770
Can't you artists yield?

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:20.730
Finished eating?

00:35:26.689 --> 00:35:27.290
Check please.

00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:34.450
Besides those around Lin Xirou,

00:35:35.209 --> 00:35:36.569
there are four more Earth Fiends

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.930
deployed around Xicang by her.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.649
I think they're unguarded now.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.529
Make the first move

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.850
and capture them

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:46.970
to exchange for Jiang.

00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:51.410
Here's their profile.

00:35:57.009 --> 00:35:58.410
From Yan Tuo again?

00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:05.290
If this plan works,

00:36:06.049 --> 00:36:07.529
it'd be great.

00:36:09.209 --> 00:36:10.410
But before that,

00:36:13.529 --> 00:36:15.290
can I meet Yan Tuo?

00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:20.649
I'll connect you two,

00:36:22.489 --> 00:36:23.890
but if you don't trust him

00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:26.930
or can't convince others,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.330
don't force it.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.129
I'll execute the plan with him.

00:37:06.154 --> 00:37:11.632
(Yan Tuo)

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.009
Xing Shen?

00:37:23.169 --> 00:37:24.049
Mr. Yan.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.330
Luo said you

00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:27.770
want to meet me?

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:30.410
Yes.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.410
My situation is complicated.

00:37:34.009 --> 00:37:35.169
It's difficult to do so.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.129
Then I can't trust you.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.489
I gave you the info of Earth Fiends.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.089
Why don't you trust me?

00:37:49.169 --> 00:37:50.970
How do I verify its authenticity?

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.410
We're in the same boat now.

00:37:56.609 --> 00:37:57.689
Besides, I need

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.730
your help rescuing my sister Lin Ling.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.129
She's Lin Xirou's blood bag.

00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:02.890
I have no reason to deceive you.

00:38:03.049 --> 00:38:03.970
Are you sure

00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:06.850
she's Lin Xirou's blood bag?

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.810
I'm sure.

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.129
No other possibilities.

00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:15.209
Hello.

00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:18.169
Hello.

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:21.129
Come to Hanlin first.

00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:23.330
Contact me after arrival.

00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:25.890
I can't even leave my house now.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.330
Want me to leave Xicang? You...

00:38:48.129 --> 00:38:49.209
Didn't you shower?

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.609
Then why ran the tap for so long?

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.850
Water's too cold. Let it run longer.

00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:57.129
What about now?

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.209
I'll go take my clothes.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.410
To develop drugs,

00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:17.489
countless animals have died here.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.529
Just to alleviate

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:23.049
your human headaches and diarrhea.

00:39:30.649 --> 00:39:31.930
Are you speaking for the animals

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.410
to voice grievances against humans?

00:39:37.009 --> 00:39:40.290
Animals are submissive
and fearful, even obsequious

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:41.930
toward humans.

00:39:43.009 --> 00:39:44.569
We don't represent animals.

00:39:45.209 --> 00:39:46.970
So you impersonate humans,

00:39:47.649 --> 00:39:48.850
hoping animals

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:54.290
to be submissive, fearful,
and obsequious toward you?

00:39:57.009 --> 00:39:58.169
I just think the difference

00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:59.890
between animals and humans

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.649
isn't as vast as you believe.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.370
Jiang.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.290
So Roadsound Pharmaceuticals

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.169
could save a significant portion

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.489
of its animal testing budget.

00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:19.890
Just staying alive.

00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:22.770
Just staying alive.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:25.970
Just staying alive.
