00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.360
A little lower.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.920
Me.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.320
What's happening to me?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.760
Bitten by a poisonous insect.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.360
You can't scratch this.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.480
It's all red here.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880
Then put on a thicker layer for me.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.680
Lower your clothes a bit more.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.400
A little lower.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.920
Okay.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.640
Let me do it, let me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.600
Is that enough?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.360
Is it enough now?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.160
Brother Yu likes her so much.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.560
She’s actually involved with the wicked fox.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.880
But...

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.040
If I spread this around,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.320
Brother Yu will be heartbroken,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.680
and he'll lose face.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.640
What should I do?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.080
Why do I feel someone is outside the carriage?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.360
I don't think so.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.800
The princess is sleeping in the carriage next door.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.320
I forgot about her.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.680
Go on, go on.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.400
Shameless couple.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360
If not for Brother Yu’s sake,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.840
I’d have you cut into a thousand pieces.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.960
How has Mother been eating lately?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.040
The Empress Dowager still can't eat.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.960
She just lit calming incense and went to sleep.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.560
Your child greets Mother.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
Lin’er.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.800
Lin’er.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.440
Come to Mother quickly.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.560
Lin’er, is that you?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.760
Your Majesty.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.320
Your servant didn’t know it was Your Majesty.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.960
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.440
Mother.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.240
What’s wrong with you?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.200
Your Majesty.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
My family would never threaten the court.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.840
Military officers won’t build private armies.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.320
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.600
Mother is mistaking me for Imperial Father.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.600
Why is this happening?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.440
Come.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.200
I understand.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.280
I failed to consider this before.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.320
My Queen.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.800
Don’t worry.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.480
Really.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.880
Really.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.240
Your Majesty.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.320
Mother has been restless and sleepless.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.640
Is it related to her chronic migraines?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.320
I...

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.120
I took the Empress Dowager’s pulse yesterday.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.720
It was the same as usual.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.800
I suspect

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.040
she caught a chill yesterday, that’s why.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.480
If it’s just a chill,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.360
why would Mother mistake me

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.960
for Imperial Father?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.960
If that’s the case,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.080
I believe

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.960
the Empress Dowager’s migraines have returned.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.960
She’s developed hysteria from exhaustion.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.320
You check her wellness pulse every day.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.000
How did you not notice?

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.760
Mother’s condition has worsened.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.800
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.360
Li Quan.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.560
At your service.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.280
Move my memorials here.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.760
Yes.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.760
Continue checking the Empress Dowager’s pulse.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.760
Make sure she feels at ease.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.040
Yes.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.120
Madam.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.320
How is it?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.440
It’s fine now.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.360
Much better.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.840
Then let’s get ready to depart.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.240
Okay.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.200
Miss Nan.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.120
I have something to tell you.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.920
Come with me for a moment.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.720
Princess.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.120
We’re about to leave.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.640
If you have something to say, say it in the carriage.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.440
No, I have to say it now.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.280
Then go ahead.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.320
We need to get some things ready anyway.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.800
Alright.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.280
Miss Nan.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.240
I already know about your situation.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.080
What do you know?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.160
Your secret.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.080
I know everything.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440
Did you just overhear

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.320
what we were talking about?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.120
Yes.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.600
I didn’t expect you to be...

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.440
Forget it.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.920
I can’t tell Brother Yu myself.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.720
You should confess to him yourself.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.840
Me...

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.200
Confess what?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.400
She’s always known.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.640
He...

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.400
He knows about you two.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.640
What about us?

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800
That’s just how it is.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.720
Ask her if you don’t believe me.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.200
The Rui Family has always been upright.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.600
How could they allow you to do this?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.840
What did we do?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.400
You...

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.840
As Brother Yu’s wife,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.040
you secretly got involved with the wicked fox.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.640
He’s Brother Yu’s second brother.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240
What are you talking about?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.120
Careful!

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.400
Careful!

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.320
You’re hurt.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.840
Don’t mind me, go quickly!

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.640
Go!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.680
Brother Yu!

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.440
Princess!

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.160
Brother Yu!

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.040
What’s wrong?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.800
Brother Yu, there are bandits!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.840
Miss Nan, she...

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.400
Chong Ming.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.840
Yes.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.000
Go!

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.000
Brother Yu!

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What should we do?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.640
It’s fine, Princess, it’s fine.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.120
Search.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.040
Check.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.040
Are you alright?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.320
Miss.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320
You’re hurt.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.240
I’m fine.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.320
Go!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.240
Brother Yu is back.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.600
Are you all right?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.720
How did you get hurt so badly?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.080
I'm fine.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.800
Just a cut from a blade.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840
It didn't hit anything vital.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.920
There's medicine in the carriage.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.040
Darn it, let me bandage you.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.520
Liang Jin.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.440
Get the medicine.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.640
Yes, sir.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.040
Everyone, get ready to depart.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.280
Yes.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.520
Bring the horse over.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.840
There's one more thing to handle.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.680
What is it?

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280
The princess thinks

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440
I have feelings for Second Brother.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.720
She wants me to confess to you.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.480
See?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.400
I told you there'd be a misunderstanding.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.440
But you wouldn't listen.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.880
Go get bandaged first.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.080
I'll explain to the princess.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.200
Explain?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.800
Let me handle it—it's a man's job.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.200
Princess.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.040
I have a secret to tell you.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.520
I know.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.240
You want to say

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.720
the one you like

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.160
is actually Rui Er the Fox.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.120
Me.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.800
Right?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.520
You—

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640
I'm actually a man.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.040
Sorry for letting you misunderstand so long.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.040
I'm truly sorry.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.920
You—

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.480
You're a man?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.120
A man?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.520
Then—

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.680
Then why did Royal Brother

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800
grant you and Brother Yu a marriage?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.840
How can two men be together?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.400
Two men...

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.920
Your Majesty

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.440
wants to promote the Military Imperial Exam.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.400
Restore the military officers.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.240
Young Master Nan disguised himself

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.840
as a woman to avoid trouble.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.640
Now he's of marrying age.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.720
So I help him keep his identity secret.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.440
Once civil and military tensions ease,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.840
and the exam is implemented,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.920
Young Master Nan

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.320
can reclaim his true identity.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.080
And take command of the army again.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.720
General of the Cloud Banner.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.400
Pearl Princess.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.360
Here they come.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.000
It's getting late.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.760
We should get back on the road.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.600
I'll go get bandaged.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.960
And change my clothes.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.520
Young Master Nan.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.840
Let's go.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.200
Your Majesty.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.120
I didn't expect, after all these years,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.160
Mother still can't let go

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.920
of what happened back then.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.080
Those who could talk

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.520
honestly with me have all gone away.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.440
Qiao Youyi.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.640
Qiao Youyi.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.320
Where's that brat?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.440
Qiao Youyi!

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.400
Why are you standing by the wall?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.800
Aren't you doing the same?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.160
Ignoring the main gate,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320
and climbing the wall instead.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.480
Qiao Youyi.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960
I knew you'd be here.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.320
My dad's coming—let's go!

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.000
Brother Yu, I'm sorry.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.800
After you turned me down that day,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.600
I figured things out.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.280
I won't like you anymore.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.760
A princess shouldn't

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.560
be fixated on someone like me.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.880
I've decided.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.960
From now on,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.400
I'll like Young Master Nan.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.560
Careful!

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.440
Brother Yu.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.840
We grew up together,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.600
but men and women are different.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.000
We should keep some distance.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.000
Yes.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400
Are you all okay?

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.560
Wicked fox, how are you driving?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.560
Young Master Nan is driving.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.000
I'm just enjoying the breeze.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.760
Young Master Nan,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.560
Young Master Nan.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.800
Are you tired?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.680
If you're tired,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.040
come inside and rest.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.880
Let the wicked fox drive instead.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.160
Thank you for your kindness, Princess.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.360
I'm not tired.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.600
Then—

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.840
I'll go out and keep you company.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.840
You should rest in the carriage.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.880
It's too sunny outside.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.040
It's fine.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.880
Princess.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.000
Are you all right?

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.760
It hurts so much—I'm fine, really!

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.600
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.960
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.200
Don't worry about me.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.760
Even driving, you're so witty.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.560
Young Master Nan, come in if you're tired.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.600
Why are you running?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.600
My dad wants to drag me to another matchmaking.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.040
Sorry about that.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.640
It's fine.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.320
Um...

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.760
By the way, are you married?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.960
No.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.360
No one at home urging you?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.520
Well, they did urge me yesterday.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.200
Looks like we're in the same boat.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.440
You look quite good.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.360
I bet you have plenty of matchmakers at home.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.960
To be honest, Miss Qiao,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.960
my mother has been seriously ill lately.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.200
My marriage plans are on hold for now.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.520
What illness does your mother have?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.440
I'm not trying to pry.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.760
I just know a few good doctors.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.880
Maybe they could help you.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.560
I'm not blaming you.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.640
I just don't know how to describe it.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.560
My mother

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.960
went through some things in the past.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.800
She was deeply affected back then.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.560
She developed some lingering illnesses.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.640
She's been resting ever since.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.640
Last night, she suddenly had hysteria.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.960
She mistook me for my father.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.800
The doctor gave her a few acupuncture needles.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.160
That finally calmed her down.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.040
Hysteria?

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.720
Does she also get migraines?

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.160
She gets headaches if she catches a chill.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.960
Well...

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.400
It's been like that for as long as I remember.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.520
That's the same as the General's wife.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.960
Could you spare half a month?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960
I can give it a try.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.560
Meet me tomorrow at dawn.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.760
I'll take you up the mountain to gather herbs.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.560
Gather herbs?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.040
I'll go prepare what we need for tomorrow.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.280
See you at dawn tomorrow.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.800
See you tomorrow.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.720
Even though we've headed south,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.920
it's still chilly.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.680
Don't catch a cold.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.960
My grilled fish is delicious too.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.080
Try some.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.520
Young Master Nan,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.040
how do you know how to grill fish?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.000
It smells so good!

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880
I was raised as a military officer.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.480
I caught fish in the river as a child.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.880
Climbed trees for bird eggs.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.200
I did all sorts of rough things.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.480
Princess, you shouldn't do such things.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.200
You're amazing.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.560
Can you teach me?

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.240
I've loved catching fish since I was little.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.120
And

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.360
I'm also skilled at cooking.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.600
Then catch two more fish tomorrow.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.800
I'll cook them for you.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.000
Rui Yu,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.000
Eat up.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.200
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.080
Better save it for the Princess.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.000
You and Brother Yu are both men.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.880
Pretending to be a couple in the capital was one thing.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.680
But now everyone knows the truth.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.480
No need to keep acting, right?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.360
Alright.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.840
We'll be careful.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.080
What are we acting?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.680
Can't I just be nice to Rui Yu?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.040
Princess, that's not what he meant.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.600
Look at you.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.680
It's already at your mouth.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.680
Nan Chenxiao, I'm a princess, you know!

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.560
Say it louder,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.200
and you'll call the bandits over.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.080
Even if you're the king, it won't help.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.440
So what if bandits come?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.040
Aren't you all here to protect me?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.760
Yes, we're all here to protect you.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.960
But if you get us all killed,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200
the road to Pingxiang

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.880
we won't live to escort you.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.840
Princess,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.840
have some water.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.800
Who wants your lousy fish?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.800
Eat it yourself.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.280
Princess.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.880
Princess.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.360
Princess.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.600
Don't mind her.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.080
Running out like that—

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.800
What if something happens?

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.600
Didn't Second Brother go after her?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.880
It's fine.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.200
Chong Ming,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.080
where's the Princess?

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.480
Sorry.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.840
I was too impulsive just now.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.800
But I just

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.840
couldn't stand what she was saying.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.160
I know.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.800
No need to apologize.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.560
It's just—

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.240
We must be careful on this journey.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.360
We can't afford any mistakes.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.280
I'll be careful.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.280
Eat while it's hot.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.400
Better save it for the Princess.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.440
She doesn't need this.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.440
Eat up.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.360
Me

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.280
I'm not actually throwing a tantrum.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.880
I'm just a little sad, that's all.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.880
I know.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.480
wicked fox

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.600
Do you think I'm

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.360
a really unfit princess?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.920
Then what do you think a proper princess

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.920
should be like?

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.880
Literature

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.680
I can only read and write.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.320
I read some storybooks.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.760
I can't write those romantic poems.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.080
I'm not as cultured as Wanwan.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.680
Martial arts

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.680
I know even less about that.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.480
I always trouble my royal brother.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.040
I feel like I'm useless.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.680
Who says so?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.080
Rumor has it, the common folk all say

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.520
that Princess Chunxi

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.280
is both talented and beautiful,

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.280
graceful and intelligent,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.520
ethereal beauty.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.960
This...

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.480
Are they really talking about me?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.400
Actually, everyone knows princesses

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.000
only from storybooks.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.000
Just like you,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.440
learn about the people from reading stories.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.080
You've snuck out of the palace a few times.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.880
How do you find the outside world

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.440
compared to what you imagined?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.120
The outside world...

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.920
I always thought life outside would be more fun,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.720
more exciting.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.960
But under the Royal Capital,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.960
danger lurks everywhere.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.960
But this time, we've gone farther.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.880
It's just like the storybooks say,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.760
the scenery is beautiful and pleasant.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.120
So you see,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.560
good and evil always coexist.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.960
Fortune and misfortune are neighbors.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.120
Everything in this world

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.680
has two sides.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.040
But I think

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.640
what people say isn't wrong.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.560
Princess Chunxi

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.520
is truly graceful and intelligent.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.680
And as for ethereal beauty,

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.760
it's not half as dazzling as yours.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.040
This is for you.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.920
What is it?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.920
It's not some ancient rare book, is it?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.520
I can't get through those.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.080
It's Wang Guanshan's new book.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080
How did you get it?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.200
I...

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.960
have my ways.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.360
I know Wang Guanshan.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.680
When we return to the capital,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.880
can you take me to meet him?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.680
I love his storybooks the most.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.600
Sure, sure.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.120
As long as we get back safely,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.240
I'll take you to meet him.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.880
Really? That's wonderful!

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.920
What's this new book about?

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.200
It's about

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.560
a stunningly beautiful lady,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.040
and a mediocre scholar

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.480
wandering the world together.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.440
Lady?

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.520
Why is she a lady,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.280
not a princess?

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.240
Why a scholar,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.920
didn't he write about generals before?

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.720
Why don't you write to Wang Guanshan

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.520
and tell him

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.040
a princess shouldn't be with a scholar,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.960
she should be with a general.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.280
Why do you have so many questions?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.080
If you won't read it, give it back.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960
It's a new book, after all.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.640
You've got it now.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.880
Why wouldn't you read it?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.560
I can't see clearly.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.880
Didn't you already read it?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.080
Tell me the story.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.240
It's too long.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.480
Let's head back first.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.240
You can read it slowly tomorrow.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.680
Me...

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.120
I just snuck out, now I'm going back?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.840
That's so embarrassing.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.120
Stay with me a little longer.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.080
When we go back, just say

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.800
you begged and pleaded

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.960
to get me to return.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.040
Alright.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.080
Just tell me the story.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.320
Tell it well.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.160
Legend says, in the distant Kingdom of Luoya,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.840
there was a beautiful lady.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.720
Princess!

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.520
Alright, alright, princess, princess.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.480
Legend says, in the distant Kingdom of Luoya,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.680
there was a beautiful princess.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.040
The princess was lively and kind.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.400
The whole kingdom saw her birth

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.320
as a heavenly blessing.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.240
This time, he gave me command of the Chongming Guard.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.680
I feel I'm one step closer to regaining my true identity.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.280
Soon, I can join the army

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.440
as a man.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.080
And serve my country.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.400
He can return to being a man,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.080
but I can only be the Third Young Master of the Rui Family.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.040
Even if we try to be husband and wife,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.200
it's only within the Rui Residence.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.080
One day, we'll have to part.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.880
Princess.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.400
I ate too much.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.560
I want to go for a walk.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240
You all go do your own thing.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.800
You should all get some rest early.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.400
We have to travel again tomorrow.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.040
What's wrong with your throat?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.040
It's nothing, just from talking too much.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.560
Princess.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.200
Princess, you'll have to put up with
tonight's arrangements.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.880
Sleep on a straw mat.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.200
Once we reach the post station tomorrow,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.600
we'll be able to sleep better.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:36.920
Uh...

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.800
I'm so far away from you all.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.680
The three of us are all men.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.080
So...

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.480
But you're here to protect me.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.200
If I'm so far from you,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.560
what if something happens?

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.840
So, Princess, you mean...

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.160
Like this?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.880
Young Master Nan knows martial arts.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.080
Then Young Master Nan should

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.600
sleep by the door.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.800
I...

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.760
Brother Yu sleeps on this side.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.280
Wicked fox sleeps on this side.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.240
I'll sleep in the middle.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.560
How about that, everyone?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.440
You...

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.400
Let's do as the Princess says.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.400
It's getting late.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.480
You all should rest early too.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.760
We'll go to sleep first.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.680
It's cold at night, you sleep by the door.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.800
If it's too cold, use more covers.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.040
Don't catch a chill.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.160
I'm tough, don't worry.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.200
You can sleep soundly.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.680
I'll guard the door, nothing will happen.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.400
You're still injured.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.400
Don't try to act tough.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.200
It's just a minor wound.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.000
It's fine.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.360
Go to sleep now.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.160
Are you two going to sleep or not?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.400
Yes, sleeping.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.080
Let's sleep, let's sleep.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.840
Young Master Lin.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.160
Miss Qiao.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.520
You're up so early.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.160
It's not the agreed time yet.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.320
Miss Qiao helped me so much.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.720
How could I let you wait for me?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.720
What is this?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.160
These are some things I prepared.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.040
We'll need them for going up the mountain.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.360
Let me see.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.600
This is...

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.320
Pastries.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.160
Water flask.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.400
Dagger.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.040
What are these for?

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.600
We usually have to spend the night
when we go up the mountain.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.320
We'll reach the forest before dark.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.160
We won't need to stay overnight.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.600
Keep the pastries to snack on
along the way.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.960
You can take the dagger and water flask.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.960
I have better insect repellent.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.760
As for this mat,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.640
I guess you haven't suffered much.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.960
Keep it for resting on the road.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.200
This mat is specially prepared
for Miss Qiao.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.560
If you think it's a burden,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.000
you don't have to bring it.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.760
I've gone up the mountain
to gather herbs with my master
since I was little.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.400
I'm long used to mountain life.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.520
But...

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.320
Thank you for doing so much for me.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.360
Let's go, let's head up the mountain.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.640
Alright.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.600
It's so peaceful in the mountains.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.720
Yes, it is.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.280
Brother Chenxiao, it's time to go.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.560
Where's Rui Yu?

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.520
Why do you always look for Brother Yu first?

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.560
We're at least a couple in name.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.360
For anything,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.960
we should at least talk to each other.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.960
But we're not in the capital now.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.640
I thought about it all night yesterday.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840
Don't you want to restore your status?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.960
Be my Princess Consort.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.760
With me protecting you,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.840
no one would dare say a word against you.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.200
I don't want to be Princess Consort.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760
I'm not worthy.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.040
I don't mind at all.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.240
Why should you care?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.360
When we return from Pingxiang,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.040
I'll talk to my royal brother.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.200
He only granted the marriage
to protect you anyway.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800
This works out well.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.560
Everyone will be happy.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.840
Princess.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.640
Are you really so carefree?

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.440
I was so rude to you last night.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.560
And you still put up with it.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.360
I was a bit willful last night.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.360
Right, can't you be gentle
like others?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.440
Be a little kinder to me?

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.280
I want to.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.720
None of your business.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.400
You...

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.440
Forget it.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.960
Military officers are all like this.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.320
General of the Cloud Banner is the same.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.200
Don't get angry.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.200
You mustn't get angry.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.360
You need a Princess's tolerance.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840
You're up.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.400
Why didn't you call me?

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.600
You were hurt yesterday.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.600
The medicine I gave you
helps you relax.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.120
A straw mat is more comfortable
than a carriage.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.240
Sleep as much as you can.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.520
Sir.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.240
Wipe it off.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.520
We'll set out soon.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.160
Brother Chenxiao.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.040
Let me wipe it for you.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040
No, no, no.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.160
I'll do it myself.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.040
Let me wipe it for you.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.120
I'm not wiping anymore.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.120
Princess, suit yourself.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.160
Nan Chenxiao.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.320
I'm a dignified Princess,
can't I do this?
