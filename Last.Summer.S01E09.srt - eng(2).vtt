{\an8}BUT JOHN GREW WEAKER
FROM A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.397
{\an8}EVEN THE TREE COULDN'T HEAL JOHN.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.232
{\an8}JOHN AND HIS TREE

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.403
ONE MORNING, JOHN'S ILLNESS WAS GONE.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:50.363
THE TREE COLLAPSED,
AND ITS ROOTS LAID BARE

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.165
JOHN WAS SCARED
THE TREE WOULD NEVER TAKE ROOT AGAIN

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.501
Every tale has its backstory

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.546
hidden until the last page.

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.012
Sometimes you close the book
'cause you'd rather not know.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.307
How many backstories

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.226
have I created that way?

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:22.687
If you know, leave.

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:32.989
The doors I closed…

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:38.453
the pages I never opened…

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.419
and the cracks I never peeked through.

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:58.264
How many more

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.685
of the summer secrets are still left?

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:10.568
{\an8}Yeah, that one.

00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:16.199
{\an8}Let's go with this.

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.368
{\an8}There's enough time, right?

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.625
{\an8}Oh, no. You worked hard.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.255
{\an8}Because of that.

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:35.218
{\an8}That's a 30-degree blade.
We use it when making models.

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.845
{\an8}Mr. Baek was cut from it yesterday.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.766
It delayed the schedule by a day,

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:44.227
but I'm glad you like it.

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:48.106
Right. I owe this blade one.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.027
It stirred something deep inside me.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.034
Ms. Song stopped by earlier.

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:01.828
We confirmed the materials.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:03.204
-Really?
-Yes.

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:06.541
That's why I didn't see her this morning.

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.544
-Okay, got it.
-All right.

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:12.922
She stopped by?

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:14.799
Is that so?

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:23.516
-Yes.
-Hey.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.434
Well…

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.228
Have you eaten?

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.064
-I'm going to.
-Oh, really?

00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:33.276
I'm almost done too.
Why don't we--

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.527
I'm on the east coast.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.446
-East coast?
-Yes.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:37.613
Talk to you later.

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:39.198
EAST COAST SASHIMI

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.054
We finally made it to the east coast.

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:03.723
It's pretty symbolic.

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.978
I don't feel like eating that.

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:11.022
CHOPPED OCTOPUS

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.690
Me neither.

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:14.817
So, how about…

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.819
boiled octopus?

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:17.737
Sounds good.

00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.491
We'll have boiled octopus. Soju or beer?

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:23.326
It's gonna be a dry week.

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:26.496
Ma'am, could I get some yogurt?

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:27.413
Sure.

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:30.875
I was stood up for two hours yesterday.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.922
My feet just had a mind of their own,

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:37.423
not following my brain.

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:40.134
They didn't obey their master.

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:42.303
They went to Mr. Baek?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.812
I'll get straight to the point
since it's between you and me.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.736
We should break up.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.077
You got your memory back.

00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:08.037
Yes.

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:13.418
Since when did you start
listening to me?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.461
You're so direct and blunt.

00:05:16.754 --> 00:05:17.672
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.841
I wanted a grown-up romance.

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:23.678
So I made the first move,
and the second I did,

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:25.972
we jumped straight to the ending.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.640
We skipped the buildup or twist.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:31.394
There were so many things

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.605
I wanted to do when I got a girlfriend.

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:49.704
Like what?

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:54.584
Would you do it for me one last time?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.343
You wanted to do this…

00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:09.682
one last time?

00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.565
Going to a theme park with my girlfriend.
It's a classic date.

00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:23.029
And…

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.368
Did you invite your friend
and his girlfriend?

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:32.830
There he is.

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:45.218
You call this a double date?

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.719
In our own way.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.515
The kidnapper, the ex-boyfriend,
and Ms. A's date.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.892
I'm very excited.

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:54.310
Let's go.

00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:57.647
All right. Let's go.

00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.280
I'll go first.

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:07.949
Just follow me.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.537
It's a real ghost!

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.579
A real ghost!

00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:14.539
For real!

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:17.250
Hey! Attorney Seo!

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:18.960
Attorney Seo!

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:30.805
Why do I keep missing?

00:07:30.888 --> 00:07:32.265
Oh, bummer.

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:38.020
I haven't held a gun since the military.

00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:07.925
You know you've spent over 50,000 won?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.768
PERFECT VICTORY

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:21.480
-Deal?
-Deal!

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.995
Attorney Seo. He's really good at this.

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:37.330
You'd better give up.

00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:38.372
Looks like I'm better.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:41.876
KNOCKDOWN

00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.881
So? You up for a match?

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:50.968
Take that!

00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:55.848
No, block it! Block that.

00:08:56.849 --> 00:08:58.100
Kapow!

00:08:58.184 --> 00:08:59.685
{\an8}KNOCKDOWN
WIN

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:00.936
This won't do, Ha-gyeong.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.271
That's the only way.

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:03.522
Come on, final round.

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:06.859
Hey, work harder.

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:08.277
Hey.

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:10.154
Hey!

00:09:11.155 --> 00:09:12.823
-Double combo!
-Block him!

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:15.159
KNOCKDOWN
WIN

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.166
Seo Su-hyeok, boo.

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:34.220
What? What's with the look?

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.514
Just…

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.935
I think I get why she dated you.

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.942
Thanks for being such a good friend…

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:51.195
she can talk to,

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.365
for letting things end here,

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:56.367
and…

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.703
for inviting me too.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.711
I hope you stay her friend
and hang out

00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:08.587
once in a while,

00:10:09.797 --> 00:10:10.840
but not very often.

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:16.095
To be honest,
I want you out of the picture,

00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:18.013
but Ha-gyeong says

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:20.433
you're the friend she can open up to.

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:23.811
I guess I need to deal with

00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:26.021
my jealousy and frustration.

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.235
As long as she's happy

00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:33.404
and smiling,

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:35.823
that's all I need.

00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:43.706
You really are mature.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:47.501
You're putting your emotions aside
to see her happy.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.383
I guess I'm part of what makes her happy.

00:10:57.344 --> 00:10:59.013
I really can't stand you.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.768
Now,

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.102
what's next?

00:11:05.186 --> 00:11:06.604
One, two, three.

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:08.355
-Hey!
-What the…

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:10.441
You didn't wait for me?

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:12.776
All right, one, two, three.

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.572
I'm sorry,
but we're in the middle of breaking up.

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:18.741
Give us some space.

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:21.368
-One, two…
-Three!

00:11:39.512 --> 00:11:42.890
You blew 50,000 won and didn't get it.
So I got it for you.

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:44.934
I'm good at the game.

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:46.560
It looks like me.

00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:53.025
You asked what I put
in the center of a bingo card.

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:56.111
Right. I've been curious all along.

00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:57.446
I wrote "ash tree."

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:03.202
Because I first met you
through that case.

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:06.497
Only the ash tree's stump remained.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.209
But you left it untouched
without pulling out.

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:13.128
It had such a special place in your heart.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:16.215
Mr. Baek planted a new tree next to it.

00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:18.884
He's so persistent.

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:22.137
I kept asking myself

00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:26.267
what I should put on the line
to go up against him.

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:30.479
Kidnapping? I can't do that.

00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:34.942
Punching Jeon Nam-jin?
I can't do that either.

00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:39.655
To be honest, I wanted to keep going.

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:42.741
But part of me wanted to stop.

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:46.412
I obviously had zero chance in this fight

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:49.039
between two 18-year-olds.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.129
Still, I'm fine,
since I'm not in love yet.

00:12:58.173 --> 00:13:00.134
That crazy way you talk,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.844
I liked that.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:06.765
Maybe being a kid is better
than being grown-up.

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:10.686
That's how I felt over these seven hours.

00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:13.814
I've had a crash course today.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:15.649
It's time for me to leave

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.652
this world of fantasy and adventure.

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:20.654
Back to where I was.

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:23.198
Attorney Seo.

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:25.075
You know what?

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.994
I've never had a breakup like this…

00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:29.705
from beginning to end.

00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:33.417
My twisted choice

00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.588
turned out undeniably cool
and sexy all the way through.

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:42.843
Breaking up with you
would be yet another twisted choice.

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:45.387
But I can't help

00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:47.264
but twist it again.

00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:52.811
Thanks for everything.

00:13:58.067 --> 00:13:59.735
That's a perfect goodbye line.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:03.113
I prefer "thank you" over "sorry."

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.541
Today's last parade is…

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.251
The timing is funny.

00:14:19.713 --> 00:14:21.256
That's our last double date

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:24.259
and that's how we said goodbye.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.181
As crazy as it is,

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:32.476
that was my love story

00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:35.396
and my breakup this summer.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:43.696
Baek Do-ha.

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:47.074
We should get going.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.576
Let's stay a little longer.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.762
Pretending not to know was my specialty.

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:09.805
Take it.

00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:12.433
All this time,

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:15.436
I ignored what my heart was telling me,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.272
burying it under the sound of cicadas.

00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:20.399
I kept running away…

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:23.527
from my feelings,

00:15:24.945 --> 00:15:26.321
from the thumping in my chest…

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:29.992
and from these words.

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:32.036
I like you.

00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:41.587
I tried so hard to run from it,

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:43.380
but I totally failed.

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:51.847
Baek Do-ha.

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:53.849
I hated you

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.684
all the time.

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.646
My strength came

00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.982
from resenting you.

00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:05.152
You told me

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.447
to hate you while being by your side.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:12.242
You already knew

00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:15.162
where my anger came from.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:20.959
I hated you because I liked you.

00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:23.712
After all that resentment…

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.299
I realized I still liked you.

00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:30.177
I still do.

00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:32.387
I still hate you,

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:34.098
but I like you.

00:16:35.974 --> 00:16:38.685
I hate you, you drive me crazy,
but I like you.

00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:41.271
Since I like you, I hate you even more.

00:16:42.397 --> 00:16:43.690
But I only hate you…

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:49.696
because I like you.

00:16:55.035 --> 00:16:56.662
You and I are all twisted,

00:16:57.704 --> 00:17:00.082
I have no idea what kind of mess
we'll end up making.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.584
But I'm going to…

00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:05.337
hold…

00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:07.422
your hand.

00:17:28.777 --> 00:17:29.611
I like you.

00:17:31.822 --> 00:17:32.948
It took me forever

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:36.410
to finally say

00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:38.996
those three simple words.

00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:08.442
Don't you dare leave,

00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:11.028
or else…

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:16.491
This time, I finally said…

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:20.662
how I really feel.

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:47.314
My summer break is over.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:49.983
Assign me the Cheongseon Construction

00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:51.985
and Hankwang Group
private equity fund case.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.248
A trip is the perfect excuse to go crazy.

00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:08.919
{\an8}SONG HA-GYEONG

00:19:09.002 --> 00:19:10.420
{\an8}What is this bingo card?

00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:14.132
I screwed up.

00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:16.301
I was cocky about those nine squares.

00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:19.930
I learned
some people can't be explained with this.

00:19:22.683 --> 00:19:24.226
Next time, I'll make it 16 squares.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.147
Anyway, give me
the Goseong inheritance dispute

00:19:29.231 --> 00:19:31.525
that I turned down back then.

00:19:33.568 --> 00:19:34.695
The first trial, right?

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:42.471
I need that tablet.

00:20:42.554 --> 00:20:43.805
I need the blueprints.

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:05.243
Looks like we won't be

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.663
sleeping tonight, right?

00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:12.459
Hey, lower!

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:13.377
-Lower.
-Higher.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.294
Higher.

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:18.882
Hey, stop.

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:20.550
-Take it.
-You!

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:25.389
This should've happened earlier.

00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:28.642
Next time, I'll definitely
beat Seo Su-hyeok.

00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:31.228
-One more round.
-What?

00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:32.562
One more round, now.

00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:33.688
Okay.

00:21:39.152 --> 00:21:40.779
What? Why're you so good?

00:21:40.862 --> 00:21:42.781
Wait. You can't do that.

00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:44.282
Stop it.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:46.827
-Hey.
-Stop.

00:22:12.352 --> 00:22:13.186
Jeez.

00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:17.065
"I like you." Was it that hard to say it?

00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:19.985
How could your fever go to 38 degrees?

00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:23.155
First breakup, first confession.

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:26.241
Do you know
how hard I pushed myself today?

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:31.163
-It's because I was so nervous.
-Are you dumb?

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.041
I was going to say yes.
What's there to be nervous about?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.295
I know.

00:22:39.296 --> 00:22:40.589
I should've just texted you.

00:22:40.672 --> 00:22:44.509
I'll look after you through the night.
Just get some rest.

00:22:52.017 --> 00:22:53.185
Are you dumb?

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.228
You didn't want to look after me?

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.439
How could your fever go to 38 degrees?

00:22:57.522 --> 00:23:00.108
It's because I was so nervous.

00:23:01.443 --> 00:23:02.777
This is unbelievable.

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:06.781
People say the first day
is the most nerve-wracking,

00:23:07.782 --> 00:23:10.243
We're shaking all over from chills.

00:23:15.332 --> 00:23:16.166
Porridge?

00:23:21.213 --> 00:23:23.548
Hey. Take your medicine.

00:23:29.596 --> 00:23:31.890
Right. Let's just eat here

00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:33.391
instead of going back and forth.

00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:41.441
Get through tonight, and we'll be over it.

00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:43.276
Get some rest.

00:23:46.446 --> 00:23:47.280
Wait.

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:52.869
You know… baesuk?

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:56.456
Your mom used to make it for you

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.667
when you had a cold.

00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:04.381
With sliced ginger and dried jujubes,
and some cinnamon, right?

00:24:06.132 --> 00:24:07.259
Make it for me tomorrow.

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:23.316
To me, Baek Do-ha's place
was a world in a 13-inch laptop.

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:26.486
Hi.

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:27.529
Have you been well?

00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:29.739
Yeah. I've been well.

00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:34.869
I have a lot of friends at school
and play basketball. I'm well.

00:24:37.914 --> 00:24:38.873
Hey.

00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:41.751
{\an8}I know you're holding back your cough.

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.505
{\an8}Go to the doctor. Go tell your mom.

00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:47.841
What for? I'm not sick at all.

00:24:50.093 --> 00:24:52.595
Besides, my mom's busy.

00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:56.725
She's busy enough as it is,
I shouldn't make it worse.

00:24:56.808 --> 00:24:59.561
Wait. Looks like the delivery's here.
Hold on.

00:24:59.644 --> 00:25:00.478
Okay.

00:25:09.112 --> 00:25:10.822
{\an8}There was no way in,

00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:13.283
{\an8}so I couldn't open that room.

00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:39.142
Promise.

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:25.563
How many more summer stories
are waiting to be revealed?

00:26:30.652 --> 00:26:33.029
A summer cold? Song Ha-gyeong?

00:26:34.322 --> 00:26:35.573
Don't make me laugh.

00:26:35.657 --> 00:26:38.493
She didn't even get COVID
while everyone else did.

00:26:39.327 --> 00:26:41.496
She sounded terrible.

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:43.373
I almost didn't recognize her voice.

00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:46.084
If it's that bad,
she should take a sick day.

00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:47.460
Why use vacation days?

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:50.213
We don't have enough sick days.

00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:52.215
What?

00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:54.300
{\an8}STOP THE PATAN HIGH
REMODELING

00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:57.387
He's promoting our project

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.848
with so much passion.

00:26:59.931 --> 00:27:02.475
He must be the one
who files complaints nonstop.

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.560
Let's pass by.

00:27:07.355 --> 00:27:08.356
{\an8}A summer cold?

00:27:08.857 --> 00:27:09.941
{\an8}Baek Do-ha got a cold?

00:27:10.024 --> 00:27:12.569
Yes. His fever is over 38 degrees.

00:27:13.778 --> 00:27:15.321
Then let's take it easy, everyone.

00:27:16.573 --> 00:27:19.159
No one seems to be worried
even though he's sick.

00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:22.996
A miracle happened,
so we should make the most of it.

00:27:23.538 --> 00:27:24.789
He didn't get sick

00:27:24.873 --> 00:27:27.542
even after being in the cold
for 12 hours with no hot pack.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:28.751
During this rainy season,

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:32.297
he did all the waterproofing work
despite the storm.

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:34.591
Come to think of it,

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:36.968
it's the first time I've heard
that Do-ha's sick.

00:27:38.678 --> 00:27:39.512
Try it.

00:27:48.229 --> 00:27:49.772
-Is it good?
-Yes.

00:27:52.442 --> 00:27:55.111
I never thought I'd taste baesuk you made.

00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:57.238
I'm all better now.

00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:03.828
So gross.

00:28:04.537 --> 00:28:07.248
Him all snotty with messy hair was

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.710
something I never saw
on the 13-inch laptop.

00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:14.672
The side he tried so hard to hide.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:20.637
This is our eighteenth summer.

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:25.308
This is how we're aching
through the summer.

00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:39.531
There you go!

00:28:42.784 --> 00:28:44.285
Good work.

00:28:48.081 --> 00:28:50.208
It's time to wake up from the dream again.

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:51.209
Every time,

00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:53.795
I feel pulled back into reality.

00:28:53.878 --> 00:28:55.046
Tell me about it.

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:58.007
Sometimes, I wish
I could stay at the rink all day.

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:02.053
From a life at 15 km/h
to one at 5 km/h.

00:29:15.984 --> 00:29:17.944
I thought you were at home
getting treatment.

00:29:18.027 --> 00:29:19.529
You were training instead?

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.489
The league prelims are next month.

00:29:21.573 --> 00:29:24.325
We have matches coming up
and training.

00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:26.786
You promised you'd skip this training.

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:28.955
How can I give up?

00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:32.000
Seul, don't you know me?

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:34.586
My nickname.
Oh Seung-taek with two hearts.

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:37.130
They said it could cause muscle damage.

00:29:37.213 --> 00:29:39.173
Worst case, it could lead to infection,

00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:40.758
complications, or even dialysis.

00:29:40.842 --> 00:29:41.759
Seul.

00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:45.096
That's enough.

00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:50.768
Fine.

00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:53.605
I'll give in this time too.

00:29:54.022 --> 00:29:54.856
So…

00:29:56.524 --> 00:29:58.359
for the wedding prep…

00:30:03.573 --> 00:30:05.491
I guess I'll have to work twice as hard.

00:30:09.162 --> 00:30:11.289
I already organized everything.

00:30:17.378 --> 00:30:20.423
I checked out a lot of wedding halls.

00:30:20.506 --> 00:30:23.217
Look. This one was really pretty.

00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:25.929
Not this one.

00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:27.305
Oh, this one.

00:30:27.972 --> 00:30:30.642
{\an8}Here, the bride doesn't enter
down the stairs.

00:30:30.725 --> 00:30:32.352
{\an8}It's a ramp.

00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:34.020
So we can enter together.

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:37.690
Oh, and they'll adjust everything,
even the tables,

00:30:37.774 --> 00:30:39.150
to fit your wheelchair height.

00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:42.028
Seul, I'm sorry,

00:30:42.111 --> 00:30:43.780
but I've got ground training.

00:30:43.863 --> 00:30:45.239
I should go now.

00:30:45.323 --> 00:30:46.366
Oh.

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:49.327
Okay.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.830
I'll probably be done late,
so don't wait and go home.

00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:56.334
Okay.

00:31:09.472 --> 00:31:10.640
Good job, everyone.

00:31:10.723 --> 00:31:11.557
GO, SEUNG-TAEK

00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:13.685
My body feels a little stiff today.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:19.774
-You're up?
-Yes.

00:31:21.818 --> 00:31:22.735
Looks like

00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:25.238
we're both feeling a little better.

00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:29.200
You're right.

00:31:29.993 --> 00:31:30.827
So, tomorrow…

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.078
Wait.

00:31:33.413 --> 00:31:36.124
Tomorrow, I already have plans.

00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:50.263
I'll join you for that plan too.

00:31:57.812 --> 00:31:58.646
Let's go.

00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.822
THE LATE KIM AE-JEONG

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:09.574
REST WITH A SMILE
WE LOVE YOU

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.387
Those kids.

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:35.975
They didn't forget
to express their thanks to her.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.191
Why did you choose this place for her?

00:32:46.527 --> 00:32:50.114
They say the tree enjoys the time
the departed missed.

00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:52.742
I thought that was cool.

00:32:58.664 --> 00:32:59.874
Mom will be happy.

00:33:03.044 --> 00:33:03.878
INSTANT NOODLES

00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:30.738
I'm home.

00:33:31.948 --> 00:33:32.949
That hits the spot.

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:40.081
Ha-gyeong. Song Ha-gyeong!

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:46.087
Here.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.846
Why? Is it bad?

00:33:55.513 --> 00:33:59.016
I'm craving instant noodles
with some soju.

00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:20.288
What's wrong?

00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:23.457
Did you see someone you know?

00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:25.501
No, it's nothing.

00:34:28.296 --> 00:34:29.130
Let's go.

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:42.560
PHOTOSHOOT DRESS SELECTION
HONEYMOON PLANNING

00:34:42.643 --> 00:34:44.645
We have to make a decision today.

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:45.938
We're running out of time.

00:34:47.648 --> 00:34:48.482
Take a look.

00:34:58.868 --> 00:34:59.785
Don't we look cute?

00:35:02.455 --> 00:35:04.165
That was when I became

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.084
the second person in Korea
to be scouted for Canada.

00:35:07.168 --> 00:35:08.377
In 2017.

00:35:09.128 --> 00:35:11.172
We did long-distance for two years.

00:35:12.882 --> 00:35:16.302
Right. You looked really cool back then.

00:35:17.762 --> 00:35:20.723
I was so worried you might cry,

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:22.683
try to stop me,

00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:25.061
or say you'd come with me.

00:35:26.187 --> 00:35:27.396
I'm so happy for you!

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.481
SEVEN YEARS AGO

00:35:28.564 --> 00:35:29.982
It's been your lifelong dream.

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:34.612
You're someone
who can make all your dreams come true.

00:35:35.363 --> 00:35:37.573
We made this wish
at the Wishing Rock in Jeju

00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:39.408
on our third anniversary, remember?

00:35:40.409 --> 00:35:41.244
I'm so happy!

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.539
Seul.

00:35:46.624 --> 00:35:47.458
Let's get married.

00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:51.462
Give me two years
with the Vancouver team.

00:35:53.005 --> 00:35:54.340
After that, let's get married.

00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:02.807
And that year,
when we promised we'd marry…

00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:14.735
Oh Seung-Taek collided hard
with the goal post

00:36:14.819 --> 00:36:17.989
after being outmatched in a blocking valve
against Derek Lee.

00:36:18.072 --> 00:36:20.074
{\an8}He's currently holding on
to his lower back.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.368
Let's hope the injury isn't serious.

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:33.671
There's serious damage
to the spinal nerves.

00:36:36.757 --> 00:36:38.634
The paralysis below the waist

00:36:39.593 --> 00:36:41.887
is likely to be permanent.

00:36:57.153 --> 00:36:58.654
Even back then, you smiled.

00:37:00.114 --> 00:37:01.782
You worried I might be upset,

00:37:02.992 --> 00:37:04.327
struggle,

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.453
or just…

00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:08.789
get more hurt.

00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:11.500
But, Seul,

00:37:12.084 --> 00:37:13.252
every time you smile…

00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:16.547
I end up hurting even more.

00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:20.009
What's the matter?

00:37:20.926 --> 00:37:24.889
What I'm saying is,
you can stop smiling in front of me.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.185
Let's end it here.

00:37:33.272 --> 00:37:34.231
I'm sorry.

00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:37.151
I was selfish.

00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:39.737
I kept telling myself,

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:42.948
"Just this year, just this season,
just this summer…"

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.369
It ended up taking too long.

00:37:51.123 --> 00:37:52.875
Now, smile only when you want to.

00:37:54.877 --> 00:37:56.754
Live with your feet on the ground.

00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:01.217
Seung-taek.

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:14.188
When we met again after my accident,

00:38:15.356 --> 00:38:16.524
remember what we promised?

00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:19.527
If either of us wanted to break up,

00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:22.571
we'd never cry…

00:38:24.865 --> 00:38:26.742
or hold the other person back.

00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:33.040
Thank you for everything.

00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:36.168
I should go.

00:39:12.621 --> 00:39:13.456
Are you asleep?

00:39:15.916 --> 00:39:16.959
No.

00:39:25.968 --> 00:39:29.763
Earlier, did you see the instant noodles

00:39:29.847 --> 00:39:31.098
at my mom's pine tree?

00:39:34.268 --> 00:39:35.561
I think Dad was there.

00:39:37.354 --> 00:39:39.064
-Back in the day--
-I remember.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:43.319
They got busted
eating instant cup noodles.

00:39:44.153 --> 00:39:45.905
You lost it, yelling like crazy,

00:39:46.864 --> 00:39:49.408
ran to my room, and cried quietly.

00:39:53.245 --> 00:39:54.497
You remember all that?

00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:02.213
Of course. I've got some…

00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:04.548
Actually, a lot of issues.

00:40:04.632 --> 00:40:05.841
And then…

00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:10.513
you didn't leave her side at all,
taking care of her.

00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:12.848
That's you.

00:40:14.183 --> 00:40:16.894
I'm sure she knows what's in your heart.

00:40:20.272 --> 00:40:23.776
Maybe if we stay close,

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:26.612
we'll end up seeing things
we don't want to see.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.658
Is there more to see?

00:40:31.742 --> 00:40:32.868
In our first big fight,

00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:36.247
you got mayo up your nose,
so we rinsed it out with saline.

00:40:37.456 --> 00:40:39.708
Besides that, we have more to see?

00:40:39.792 --> 00:40:40.876
Shut up.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.337
Right. When you ran off to my room,

00:40:44.213 --> 00:40:45.464
your bras were on the floor.

00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:46.882
I don't need to see that.

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:48.259
Hey.

00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:49.176
I don't know.

00:40:53.305 --> 00:40:54.640
Do you want to know my secret?

00:40:58.561 --> 00:40:59.562
This is the first time

00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:02.731
I've shown anyone I was sick.

00:41:04.024 --> 00:41:04.858
Thanks

00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:07.194
for taking care of me.

00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:09.905
I know you've always wanted to do that.

00:41:13.951 --> 00:41:15.995
Remember when the breaker shut off?

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.039
The blackout that day?

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:22.585
I tripped the breaker on purpose,
so you'd hurry home.

00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:23.669
Hey!

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:26.714
You're insane!

00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:30.384
My mom's dugyeonju got smashed
because of you.

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:31.552
That was for my wedding.

00:41:34.805 --> 00:41:36.557
So what else, got another secret?

00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:40.227
I don't know.

00:42:39.328 --> 00:42:40.621
Ms. Song.

00:42:40.704 --> 00:42:41.538
Hey.

00:42:42.289 --> 00:42:45.376
You took a few days off,
and your skin's glowing.

00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:46.585
-Really?
-Yes.

00:42:47.336 --> 00:42:48.879
I guess you rested really well.

00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:52.466
Kind of.
I did take care of an old matter.

00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:54.093
An old matter?

00:42:56.762 --> 00:42:57.596
What is it?

00:42:59.056 --> 00:42:59.890
What's this?

00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:06.480
Please proceed,
leaving no detail out till the end.

00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:08.732
-That's it. Thanks.
-Thank you.

00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:18.867
The professor called me.

00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:19.827
Which one?

00:43:19.952 --> 00:43:20.869
Professor Nam.

00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.956
She's waiting for your call.

00:43:27.584 --> 00:43:31.922
You and my mom are surely close.
You even share my private life?

00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:34.633
Baek Do-ha.

00:43:36.009 --> 00:43:37.344
I heard you got the email too.

00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:43.851
It's not certain.

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:47.354
I've gotten
many messages like that before.

00:43:47.438 --> 00:43:49.481
{\an8}I heard the MRA reached out.

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:21.221
Stop the construction for the time being.

00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:25.017
What is this all of a sudden?

00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:28.771
Every site has noise, dust or complaints.

00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:30.647
It's not my call.

00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:35.235
Don't you know the higher-ups decide
whether we move forward or stop?

00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:38.822
The public architect resigned,
the one in charge was attacked,

00:44:38.906 --> 00:44:41.825
someone's protesting against it,
and the banners went up.

00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:45.704
The mayor's on edge
with two months until the election.

00:44:45.788 --> 00:44:48.332
There's no reason for us to cause issues.

00:44:48.415 --> 00:44:49.917
It's just for the time being.

00:45:10.187 --> 00:45:11.021
What's this for?

00:45:11.605 --> 00:45:12.689
Are you going somewhere?

00:45:13.982 --> 00:45:14.983
Yes.

00:45:21.573 --> 00:45:24.451
I need to go to the States for a bit.

00:45:26.328 --> 00:45:29.498
Why? Is something wrong? Is it serious?

00:45:30.165 --> 00:45:31.500
No, it's just…

00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:34.127
I'd requested the site records
and paperwork,

00:45:34.211 --> 00:45:37.297
and the results just came in.
I need to go handle the admin work.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.175
What is it about? Hermann?

00:45:42.928 --> 00:45:44.263
It's more important than that.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.141
So when are you leaving?

00:45:52.563 --> 00:45:53.939
I need to fly out tomorrow.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.783
PACHEON CITY HALL

00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:14.167
It won't take long.

00:46:14.751 --> 00:46:18.046
I'll be back before August 31.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.715
And after that…

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.677
I won't ever leave your side.

00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:37.524
PACHEON OBSERVATORY COMPLETION

00:46:58.712 --> 00:47:00.172
JONG-MAN JR.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:30.494
You keep forgetting.
Watch out for your brain cells.

00:47:38.043 --> 00:47:39.336
It looks tasty.

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:55.811
If you don't fix this,
it'll hurt your ears and the floor.

00:47:59.564 --> 00:48:01.566
You're really something, Baek Do-ha.

00:48:02.734 --> 00:48:04.569
They say a home is where people live.

00:48:04.653 --> 00:48:05.821
Where did he hide it?

00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:08.031
But there's no sign
that I've ever lived here.

00:48:09.616 --> 00:48:10.909
Because I was

00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:13.662
always a guest who'd leave soon.

00:48:13.745 --> 00:48:14.746
This is it.

00:48:19.084 --> 00:48:20.335
Found it.

00:48:22.129 --> 00:48:25.924
I did some sanding and varnishing
so you wouldn't get splinters.

00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:27.300
When did you do all this?

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:34.474
There it is.

00:48:34.558 --> 00:48:36.101
I didn't match the colors.

00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:45.068
There's no squeaking.

00:48:46.945 --> 00:48:48.196
This time it's different.

00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:51.158
I'm coming back soon.

00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:00.250
I know you don't believe in these things,

00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:02.169
but in case
you can't sleep while I'm away.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:13.263
So, don't get rid of it, just wait.

00:49:17.184 --> 00:49:18.185
Don't worry.

00:49:19.478 --> 00:49:21.563
By the time you find the last note…

00:49:23.148 --> 00:49:24.566
I'll have returned.

00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:30.739
Baek Do-ha came as a summer guest,

00:49:31.907 --> 00:49:33.533
planning to stay 80 days,

00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:37.245
but ended up leaving on day 52.

00:49:44.795 --> 00:49:47.714
{\an8}NO ISSUES

00:49:54.095 --> 00:49:56.139
SEUNG-TAEK

00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:58.308
You two broke up?

00:50:02.646 --> 00:50:05.398
I figured Seul didn't tell you yet.

00:50:06.817 --> 00:50:07.651
Seung-taek.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.362
Don't be ridiculous.

00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:13.114
You were planning your wedding.

00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:15.367
Are you seriously her friend?

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.410
If you're her real friend,

00:50:17.494 --> 00:50:19.663
you should've told her
to break up with me,

00:50:19.746 --> 00:50:21.122
not helping with wedding plans.

00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:25.252
Seung-taek.

00:50:26.795 --> 00:50:27.921
Seung-taek.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:30.924
Are you serious?

00:50:36.513 --> 00:50:37.389
Ha-gyeong.

00:50:37.973 --> 00:50:39.766
Do you know what's in her bag?

00:50:42.352 --> 00:50:43.270
{\an8}My catheter.

00:50:43.353 --> 00:50:44.646
{\an8}CATHETER: A MEDICAL TUBE

00:50:44.729 --> 00:50:47.107
Her calendar is packed with my schedule.

00:50:47.732 --> 00:50:49.359
She hardly sees her friends.

00:50:51.403 --> 00:50:52.445
Hey, Seul.

00:50:52.529 --> 00:50:55.407
She hasn't been coming
to our get-togethers for years.

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:58.118
Seung-taek, be good to her.

00:50:58.201 --> 00:51:00.036
This isn't easy for her.

00:51:00.662 --> 00:51:01.913
You bitch, are you done?

00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:02.956
-Hey.
-Come on, stop.

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:04.207
What's gotten into you?

00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:09.129
You're doing it right.

00:51:09.212 --> 00:51:10.881
-Thanks.
-Also, hydro…

00:51:10.964 --> 00:51:11.923
This one?

00:51:15.719 --> 00:51:16.553
That's…

00:51:17.679 --> 00:51:20.682
what happens all the time
when she's with me.

00:51:22.517 --> 00:51:23.393
But, Seung-taek…

00:51:24.769 --> 00:51:25.729
So,

00:51:26.605 --> 00:51:28.273
you have to talk trash about me

00:51:29.983 --> 00:51:32.027
and take her side, no matter what, okay?

00:51:34.279 --> 00:51:37.282
Every breakup has a backstory.

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:43.580
You're not just breaking up with Seul,

00:51:44.539 --> 00:51:45.999
but with everyone, right?

00:51:50.587 --> 00:51:53.840
And that page leaves a huge void.

00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:56.801
Seul.

00:51:57.969 --> 00:51:58.803
Seul.

00:52:01.473 --> 00:52:02.432
Hey, Lee Seul.

00:52:16.905 --> 00:52:17.948
We can only fill it…

00:52:18.031 --> 00:52:19.032
Your call has been…

00:52:19.115 --> 00:52:20.742
…with our imagination.

00:52:24.996 --> 00:52:26.957
VICTORY THANKS TO SEUL!

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.458
OUR 7TH YEAR VICTORY

00:52:37.926 --> 00:52:41.429
We can never find out
what's in there forever…

00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:53.525
until that person

00:52:54.901 --> 00:52:55.986
tells you.

00:53:13.253 --> 00:53:14.671
And on August 31,

00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:18.508
my page had a blank space.

00:53:20.927 --> 00:53:24.639
Baek Do-ha didn't come back.

00:53:36.693 --> 00:53:39.738
Before winter arrives,
winter prep is a must,

00:53:41.239 --> 00:53:43.658
so we can get through it safely.

00:53:44.993 --> 00:53:48.455
You said it would never freeze,
but it's frozen and stopped working.

00:53:48.538 --> 00:53:50.415
Where in Patan-myeon are you located?

00:53:51.249 --> 00:53:52.709
What's the address?

00:53:53.543 --> 00:53:56.171
Jangsu-ro 101-23.

00:53:56.254 --> 00:53:58.840
I'm sorry, but during winter,

00:53:58.923 --> 00:54:01.051
we need at least two days' notice
for that area.

00:54:01.134 --> 00:54:03.053
Sorry, but today won't be possible.

00:54:03.136 --> 00:54:07.015
I thought my luck was only bad in summer,
but winter's no exception.

00:54:07.098 --> 00:54:08.641
It's just as terrible.

00:54:11.269 --> 00:54:13.271
Today feels like minus 18 degrees Celsius,

00:54:13.354 --> 00:54:16.316
with 70% humidity,
and 80% discomfort index.

00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:19.903
It's so uncomfortable even in winter

00:54:20.904 --> 00:54:22.072
because of Baek Do-ha.

00:54:24.491 --> 00:54:25.617
It's snowing.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.327
JONG-MAN JR.

00:54:29.496 --> 00:54:30.330
Snow…

00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:34.959
It's snowing too?

00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:41.841
I should get ready for winter too.

00:54:49.432 --> 00:54:51.476
Drill it each time you think of me.

00:54:51.559 --> 00:54:53.561
You might as well make it heart-shaped.

00:55:01.152 --> 00:55:02.278
Hello?

00:55:02.403 --> 00:55:03.947
CHICKEN FEET

00:55:04.656 --> 00:55:06.574
When is Do-ha coming back?

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:08.451
He'll explain once he's back.

00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:12.497
He's keeping in touch,
sending emails and all.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.957
Why can't he explain now?

00:55:15.458 --> 00:55:17.961
If he's being quiet,
he must be hiding something.

00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:20.839
Maybe it's Hermann.

00:55:22.006 --> 00:55:22.841
Whatever.

00:55:24.092 --> 00:55:25.844
You're unusually calm.

00:55:26.636 --> 00:55:27.846
Your vibe has changed.

00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:30.098
Look who's talking.

00:55:30.765 --> 00:55:33.476
You went traveling after your job,
and now your style's global.

00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:39.149
First an indie singer style,
then an announcer look.

00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:41.442
What now? A biker gang?

00:55:41.526 --> 00:55:42.735
Is this a job fair?

00:55:44.237 --> 00:55:45.071
I'm unemployed now.

00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:48.032
I quit earlier.

00:55:53.663 --> 00:55:55.165
{\an8}PATAN HIGH SCHOOL

00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:57.625
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

00:55:57.709 --> 00:55:59.502
CONSTRUCTION PAUSED

00:56:33.203 --> 00:56:35.580
Since Do-ha's been gone for so long,
I see you here.

00:56:37.373 --> 00:56:40.460
I'm not allowed in his space
without your permission.

00:56:41.294 --> 00:56:42.128
Sorry?

00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:44.339
Is he keeping in touch?

00:56:47.091 --> 00:56:50.094
Well, still,
I have no idea when he'll be back either.

00:56:51.763 --> 00:56:53.306
Maybe I should've gone easy on him.

00:56:56.684 --> 00:56:57.727
Want to grab a drink?

00:57:03.358 --> 00:57:04.192
Want to toast?

00:57:04.776 --> 00:57:05.610
Cheers.

00:57:11.783 --> 00:57:12.617
So nice.

00:57:14.327 --> 00:57:16.287
It's been ages
since I drank this comfortably.

00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:18.581
It's been ages
since I drank this uncomfortably.

00:57:19.207 --> 00:57:22.835
How come?
I don't remember anything that awful.

00:57:22.919 --> 00:57:24.796
I'm a bit of a twisted person.

00:57:26.297 --> 00:57:27.924
I do remember feeling complicated.

00:57:28.633 --> 00:57:30.385
I was curious about you,

00:57:31.344 --> 00:57:32.262
annoyed by you,

00:57:33.263 --> 00:57:34.097
and liked you.

00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:35.807
All mixed together.

00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:40.186
Every time he came back
after spending summer here,

00:57:41.229 --> 00:57:42.355
he acted strange.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.442
Baek Do-ha.

00:57:47.277 --> 00:57:48.236
Open the door.

00:57:49.487 --> 00:57:50.905
Are you stuck in there again?

00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:53.449
I could tell what he was thinking

00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:55.493
and what he'd been up to…

00:58:01.249 --> 00:58:02.250
Baek Do-ha!

00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.380
…without him saying a word.

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:09.799
He'd left something behind

00:58:11.134 --> 00:58:14.846
and he was somehow
drawing out that feeling.

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:20.810
Yes, last week,
Do-ha wanted some Korean food.

00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:22.645
So we went to Koreatown.

00:58:23.229 --> 00:58:24.063
Yes.

00:58:26.232 --> 00:58:27.942
I do miss home.

00:58:28.693 --> 00:58:31.946
Of course,
there's a lot about him I don't know.

00:58:36.576 --> 00:58:37.744
I'm jealous.

00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:39.996
Truth is,

00:58:41.205 --> 00:58:43.041
I only know Baek Do-ha in summer.

00:58:46.878 --> 00:58:48.129
You said before

00:58:48.212 --> 00:58:50.548
the first step in remodeling
is always demolition.

00:58:50.632 --> 00:58:51.758
To fix anything,

00:58:51.841 --> 00:58:53.426
you have to know what needs fixing

00:58:53.509 --> 00:58:55.470
and start by tearing it down.

00:58:56.721 --> 00:58:59.932
Whether it's nostalgia,
illusions, delusions,

00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:01.726
or old memories.

00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:03.436
Whatever it is.

00:59:04.687 --> 00:59:06.564
But Do-ha isn't doing that.

00:59:08.608 --> 00:59:09.692
You know, right?

00:59:10.902 --> 00:59:12.612
What does Do-ha need to tear down?

00:59:13.988 --> 00:59:15.990
Does it have something to do

00:59:17.909 --> 00:59:19.160
with why he hasn't returned?

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:34.759
I only saw Baek Do-ha's world
through this 13-inch laptop.

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.596
I had no idea what was beyond that.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.476
Or maybe…

00:59:43.559 --> 00:59:44.519
{\an8}JOHN AND HIS TREE

00:59:44.602 --> 00:59:46.562
{\an8}I just chose not to see it.

00:59:46.646 --> 00:59:48.022
{\an8}I'LL WAIT TILL YOU GROW BACK.

00:59:48.106 --> 00:59:50.149
{\an8}THE TREE WAS COVERED
IN LUSH GREEN LEAVES

01:00:00.702 --> 01:00:03.955
See? Not too bad
once you make it to the end, right?

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:35.570
SEOUL TO NEW YORK
1 ADULT, ECONOMY

01:00:39.991 --> 01:00:41.033
PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL

01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:50.835
I waited and waited for you,
and I finally booked a plane ticket.

01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:53.087
I'm coming to you

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:55.548
before my hands get cold, you punk.

01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:00.261
I used every single day off I had.

01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.221
I'm not hiding this time.

01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:05.975
I'm coming to you. Wait right there.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.937
BAEK DO-HA

01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:16.277
How many days?

01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:18.529
-What?
-Your day off.

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:20.656
How many days off did you use?

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.574
Five days.

01:01:22.992 --> 01:01:25.369
That's perfect. That's enough.

01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:27.914
What do you mean?

01:01:29.165 --> 01:01:32.001
-I'm at the airport.
-I know.

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.920
-What?
-Look to your side.

01:01:34.545 --> 01:01:35.379
Side?

01:01:55.608 --> 01:01:56.692
I'm back.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.279
Let's go.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:01.906
Where?

01:02:11.582 --> 01:02:12.500
I brought back…

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:18.256
Baek Do-young.

01:03:04.218 --> 01:03:05.052
{\an8}What do you mean?

01:03:05.678 --> 01:03:08.347
{\an8}So it took you this long
to come back because…

01:03:08.431 --> 01:03:11.267
{\an8}I finally made it.
The amazing Peanut House.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:13.102
{\an8}You haven't changed either.

01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:14.729
{\an8}Still just as selfish.

01:03:14.812 --> 01:03:16.480
{\an8}I hope it's really over.

01:03:17.398 --> 01:03:18.441
{\an8}What do you mean?

01:03:18.524 --> 01:03:19.901
{\an8}Do-ha, what are you doing?

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:22.528
{\an8}You've been acting weird.

01:03:22.612 --> 01:03:25.489
{\an8}I usually can't sleep well
in this Peanut House.

01:03:25.573 --> 01:03:27.783
{\an8}How could you meet your ex right away?

01:03:27.867 --> 01:03:29.952
{\an8}I'm not supposed to be this happy
to see my ex.

01:03:30.036 --> 01:03:33.414
{\an8}Seems like our relationship
could use a little remodeling, right?

01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:34.790
{\an8}Why are we here again?

01:03:34.874 --> 01:03:35.917
{\an8}I'm kidnapping you.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.294
{\an8}You can call it our last goodbye trip.

01:03:39.128 --> 01:03:40.588
{\an8}Is it really a goodbye trip?

01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:44.926
{\an8}Baek Do-ha!
