00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.700
I've paved the roads for you.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.060
As long as you don't confess,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.420
no one can prove you're Lin Xia.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.539
The rest depends on you.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.200
I'll disappear for a while,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.980
as the police are onto me.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.700
Speak.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.780
Master,

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:16.900
Cheng Nuo has fled.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:18.939
Apply for a warrant.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.920
Yes.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:22.459
Qiao,

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:24.500
inform Ye Dong

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.420
to claim

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.900
Lin Xia's body.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.120
Master,

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.579
what's this about?

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.019
The body was Ai Li's.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.659
Why ask him to claim it?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.739
What's the strategy here?

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.340
We need to stir the waters

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.680
to make

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.379
the fish jump out.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.920
Never imagined

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.340
you'd manage the company

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.540
so well during this period.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.659
Truly impressive.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.579
The group's systems are robust.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.700
While minor decisions

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:56.900
don't need my approval,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.959
major decisions

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.500
go through management voting.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.099
Any idiot

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.420
could handle this position.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.340
You make it sound simple.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.580
Proves your talent

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.680
in this field.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:14.659
But

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.900
the way you act now

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.819
reminds me of Lin Xia back then.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.680
Seems

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.580
you're still hung up

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.919
on your ex-wife,

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.379
always mentioning her.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.500
Why get jealous

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.020
of a murderer?

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.300
But

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.139
did she really kill Lin Na?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.039
Then

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.060
what's her motive?

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:44.340
Well,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.139
only she

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.580
and Lin Na knew.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.419
Could it be

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.699
that you killed Lin Na

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.360
and framed her?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.199
Two birds, one stone.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Bold imagination

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
and bold questions.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.780
If it was me,

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.639
would I admit it?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.740
No ruthless tactics,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.060
no victory.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.840
Your confession means nothing.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.960
Anyone with half a brain

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.439
can figure it out.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.060
Enough digressions.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.780
You promised

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.939
if I made you CEO

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.159
and gave you shares,

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.020
you'd give me a chance.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.139
Now

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.159
it's time to deliver.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.500
I did say a chance,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:50.659
but

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.319
a chance to marry me.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.860
Before our wedding day,

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.500
no intimacy.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.199
Don't push your luck.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.360
The chance is yours.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.400
Seize it

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.159
or lose it.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.759
My patience has limits.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.719
Nobody

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.399
tests me twice.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.240
Same goes

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.779
for you.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.199
Fine.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.160
I'll marry you.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.240
Suits me.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.100
Mr. Ye,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.699
Ms. Bai.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.060
Mr. Ye,

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:46.259
police want you to claim Lin Xia's body.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:48.959
You're certain?

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.240
Absolutely.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.939
(The police found her body?)

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.920
(Could they know something?)

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.560
(They can't have evidence.)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.759
(Otherwise,)

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.040
(this isn't about claiming a body.)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.920
We'll discuss

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:10.620
details later.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.579
Let's go.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:20.819
(The police found the body long ago.)

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:23.200
(They've been keeping it under wraps.)

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.879
(They suddenly want him to claim it.)

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:27.699
(What's their intention?)

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.079
(What if he realizes)

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.139
(that isn't me?)

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.360
Honey,

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:50.579
I've imagined

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:52.199
countless times

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.639
how we'd meet again.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.720
But I never imagined

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.439
you'd become this cold body.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.399
Though you killed Lin Na,

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.639
it doesn't change that

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.120
you were my beloved wife.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.879
My current achievements

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.680
and status

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.000
are all because of you.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.759
I'm taking you home now.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.920
Mr. Ye,

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.720
please checkmark these body features.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.800
Here,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.600
here,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.319
and here.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.000
The large mole on her arm.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.060
Mole on her arm?

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.279
(Lin Xia's arms were flawless.)

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.319
(There's no mole.)

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.660
(She had a scar on her leg)

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.519
(from a dog bite in childhood).

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:49.819
(Why isn't it here?)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.399
(This isn't Lin Xia's body.)

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:55.620
(No.)

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.839
(How is this possible?)

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.100
(I'd recognize her)

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.040
(even if she turned to ashes.)

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.839
(It's definitely Lin Xia.)

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.180
(The injuries around the eyes)

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.319
(were all my doing.)

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.040
(But this body...)

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.360
Mr. Ye?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.519
Mr. Ye,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.500
what's wrong?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.040
Nothing.

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:25.480
By the way,

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.360
where did you

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.600
find her body?

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.199
In the river by a fisherman.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.439
If everything checks out,

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.480
please sign here.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.360
No problem.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.240
Don't sign!

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.480
Mr. Ye,

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.519
our apologies.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:46.339
Internal procedures aren't complete,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.480
so can't claim the body now.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.000
Fine.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:53.639
Contact me anytime

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.759
when you're ready.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:11.639
Master,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.079
Ye Dong realized Lin Xia isn't Lin Xia.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Watch them

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.160
around the clock.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:19.439
This case

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.139
will close soon.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.360
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.800
What's going on?

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.000
The face is Lin Xia's,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.439
but the body isn't.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.959
Impossible!

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.120
Dong,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.399
maybe the body is Lin Xia's.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.799
Could you be mistaken?

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.740
She was my wife.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.919
How could I forget her body?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.960
This is not Lin Xia!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.720
That's bizarre.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.200
Unless

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.139
this body consumed Lin Xia's body,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.559
leaving only her face?

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.679
Are we writing a horror novel?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.039
Bai Cha is Lin Xia.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.679
Bai Cha is Lin Xia?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.039
No way.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.019
If Bai Cha were Lin Xia,

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.960
she'd have killed for revenge.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.399
But this body

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.120
isn't Bai Cha's either.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:17.159
Lin Xia didn't swap faces with Bai Cha.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:21.179
We need verification to be certain.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:34.960
Why do you keep

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.559
staring at me today?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.799
You look beautiful when working.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.519
I never imagined

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220
that one day

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:50.139
you'd become Jiuyao Group's CEO.

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.019
I never imagined

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:57.120
you, timid and submissive before,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.399
would become Jiuyao's chairman.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.960
Do you remember?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.960
When we first met,

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.840
you wore

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.059
a red silk dress

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.440
on the DJ platform,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.879
captivating everyone.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.080
Seems

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.259
you don't care

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.879
about our past at all.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.600
When we first met,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.039
I was

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.440
in purple, not red.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.419
Right.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.320
My favorite is red,

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.440
yours is purple.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:44.559
(He indeed)

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:46.480
(recognized that body wasn't me.)

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.879
I've always

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.759
wanted to see you in red,

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.960
but you never fulfilled that wish.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.480
So now,

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:57.399
will you grant me this once?

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.639
After we marry,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.159
I'll give you

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.559
whatever you want.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.240
No.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:04.559
I can't wait.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.960
Come with me.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.440
Where to?

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.840
You'll see soon.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.500
I want to hear your signature song.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.960
Haven't played for years,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.139
my skills are rusty.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.279
Some talents

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.320
are ingrained in your bones.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.960
I believe

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.600
you couldn't have forgotten.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.759
What?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.440
Have you forgotten who you were?

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.159
Since you're so eager,

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.019
then

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.179
as you wish.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.240
(Luckily, Cheng Nuo was thorough,)

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:07.159
(or I'd have been exposed.)

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.320
Remember

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:15.200
what this tattoo means?

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:17.840
(It means)

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:19.360
(needing to be loved.)

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:25.600
Don't move.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.039
But now

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.200
I don't need love anymore.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:44.120
(Cheng Nuo replicated Bai Cha's marks)

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.200
(on me and erased mine.)

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.019
Mr. Ye,

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.379
have some self-respect.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.519
Also,

00:13:57.159 --> 00:13:58.600
our little game

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.679
should have ended long ago.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.440
Let's get married.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.539
Did you ask your mother?

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.559
Our relationship

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:16.799
is none of her concern.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.259
Pitifully,

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:21.320
Ye Dong,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.240
without her approval,

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:25.919
you're not even qualified as a person.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.580
Your backbone is too weak

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.720
to bear a husband's responsibilities.
