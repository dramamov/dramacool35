TYPHOON FAMILY

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:17.390
Dad.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.684
I'm back.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.564
I offer myself.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.650
To be exact, my position.

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.194
You can't come crying to me later.

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:33.239
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:36.826
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:48.713
HOWEVER, OTHER EMPLOYEES
OF TYPHOON TRADING

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:54.010
SHALL NOT BE IMPACTED IN ANY WAY
THROUGH THE CONTENTS OF THIS CONTRACT

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:58.097
Dad must have…

00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.349
KANG TAE-POONG

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:00.975
protected his employees like this too.

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:05.396
PYO BAK-HO

EPISODE 15
THE LAST MATCH

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:16.324
Typhoon Trading!

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.034
We can do it!

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.377
Anyway.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.088
Where did Pyo Bak-ho go?

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.007
Forget about him on a good day like this.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.802
I can't wait to find the promissory note,

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:37.971
and be done with those people.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.807
Why won't you use the CEO's office?

00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:47.522
I want to leave the place as is.
I also like it out here.

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.234
Anyway, where's Mr. Bae?

00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:53.152
He went out to pick up a call.

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:56.406
What? He's been on the phone
for half a day now.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.908
-He's back.
-Mr. Bae.

00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:02.036
Have some rice cake, Mr. Bae.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.371
Have some.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:06.040
-Mr. Bae.
-Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:08.543
Is something going on?

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:12.088
Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.465
Mr. Bae.

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.471
Mr. Bae, what's going on?

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:24.642
It's my dad.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:33.860
He's going to kill himself.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:38.656
What am I going to do?

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:49.208
-Oh, my goodness!
-Look up there!

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:52.337
-My goodness!
-Oh, no!

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:02.889
-What on earth?
-Mom.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:06.100
What do we do, Song-jung?
Your father climbed up there and…

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.853
-Oh, heavens…
-It's going to be okay, Mom.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.397
-I'll go talk to him, Mom.
-Song-jung…

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.318
-Mi-seon.
-Okay, go.

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.486
Go on up.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.412
-Stay right here.
-Sure. Off you go!

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:28.247
To the left! It's that way.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.460
STORAGE ROOM

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:43.971
-Oh, my goodness!
-Open up!

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.808
For goodness' sake, Mr. Bae!
What's gotten into you?

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.601
Seriously, don't do this.

00:04:50.103 --> 00:04:52.230
Dad… Dad!

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:53.648
I'm here, Dad.

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:56.192
Dad, can we please talk?

00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:58.152
Dad!

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:01.697
It's me. Please talk to me.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.865
Dad!

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.534
Come on. Open the door, Dad!

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:06.202
That won't work.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:08.996
We've cried and begged,
but your father wouldn't budge.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.708
You know what he's like.
Forcing the door open won't help!

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.627
-Don't agitate him further!
-Mr. Bae.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.712
Is there another way to the rooftop?

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:19.090
The fire escape ladder!

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.176
-You startled me!
-It's just…

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.970
-I'm going to take the door down!
-No!

00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:27.306
Jeez, Mr. Bae! Please open the darn door!

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:44.157
We should be able to climb up.

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:47.702
DANGER!
DON'T CLIMB UP THE LADDER

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.299
Mr. Bae.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.843
I'll go in your place.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.179
But it looks so dangerous.

00:06:06.262 --> 00:06:09.557
-Call an ambulance for me if I fall.
-Still, Mr. Kang. I just don't think--

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.850
We're family.

00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:17.106
Watch your step, Mr. Kang.

00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:18.816
Mr. Kang.

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:50.306
Who are you?

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.224
Oh, well…

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:56.687
I'm Mr. Bae Song-jung's colleague.
My name is Kang Tae-poong.

00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.398
You must be his boss.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.654
-This isn't right, Mr. Bae.
-Please, Mr. Bae!

00:07:04.737 --> 00:07:06.405
-Don't do this!
-Please…

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:08.241
-Think of your family!
-Please stop!

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.868
Excuse me, sir.

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.496
Everyone is worried sick.

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:16.832
Mr. Bae!

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:19.794
-It's dangerous!
-Please, Mr. Bae…

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:26.384
DEMAND NOTICE

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:36.644
-Is this why--
-I only have two days.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.355
Isn't it so strange?

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:44.443
Who would've thought I wouldn't be able
to pay back a mere 30 million won

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:47.238
when I have this huge facility?

00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:49.907
The IMF crisis is to blame.

00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:04.672
Look, my employees gave me this last night

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.050
to help me repay the debt.

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.722
I've been withholding their wage
for three months now,

00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:14.640
but they chipped in

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:17.393
to help me out.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:24.817
I'm sure you get it
since you run a company too.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.528
This isn't right.
I'm a sorry excuse for a CEO.

00:08:29.322 --> 00:08:33.701
The sooner I die,
the sooner they'll be free from my debt.

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:38.331
I thought that was the last thing
I could do for everyone,

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:39.790
so I came up here at dawn.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:42.918
But I got cold feet.

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:45.880
Pretty ridiculous, right?

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:50.217
If I had gritted my teeth and jumped,
we could've avoided this mess.

00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:53.679
There's only one option now.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:56.390
Will you

00:08:57.725 --> 00:08:59.644
help me get down there

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.396
with a push?

00:09:15.326 --> 00:09:16.994
When my father passed away…

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:22.625
people advised me
to file for business closure…

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.629
and disclaim my inheritance

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:29.965
to cancel all his debt.

00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:33.135
But I didn't follow their advice…

00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:37.306
because it felt like…

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:42.311
that would erase my father as well.

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.316
I may be a CEO…

00:09:50.236 --> 00:09:51.320
but before that,

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:54.323
I'm my father's son.

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:04.542
Whenever something good
happens to my company,

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:06.711
I miss my father.

00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:10.256
Whenever something sad happens,

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:13.676
I miss him even more.

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:17.972
No, that's not the best way to put it.

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:22.810
Even when I'm deep in sleep
or when I'm having a meal…

00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:28.607
To be perfectly honest, I miss my father…

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:32.111
just about every day.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.552
I miss him every single day.

00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:13.110
-Dad!
-Mr. Bae!

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.612
Come on, open the darn door!

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:20.743
-Please don't do this!
-Mr. Bae!

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:22.786
Mr. Bae!

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.088
Dad.

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.049
Song-jung.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.635
Dad…

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.018
Dad.

00:11:56.153 --> 00:11:56.987
Dad.

00:11:57.947 --> 00:11:58.989
To me,

00:12:00.157 --> 00:12:01.325
the debt is nothing…

00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:06.080
compared to the thought of losing you.

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:10.334
So please, don't think of dying.

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:20.177
Good thing their boss survived.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.226
If only our boss could've stayed
with us a little longer…

00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:26.619
Dad, I brought you fabulous news.

00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:32.875
Can you guess what this is, Dad?

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.545
See this?

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:38.631
Come on, take a look.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.593
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:49.016
I'm going to play in the big leagues now.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.101
You crazy fool.

00:13:52.436 --> 00:13:54.813
Pampered brats
who never had a taste of hardship

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:57.191
always talk big.

00:13:58.025 --> 00:14:01.070
I'm not pampered.
Do I have to starve to call it hardship?

00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:05.324
Let's cut out the nonsense, Dad.

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:09.286
I've showed you my cards.
It's time you showed me yours.

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.625
That bastard, Tae-poong,

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.086
came to the office.

00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:18.754
But he kept asking for you.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.422
Where's the CEO?

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:23.258
Hey. Where's your dad?

00:14:29.848 --> 00:14:31.433
All of you saw me here.

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.269
There's something going on.

00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:36.230
I bet it's something huge.

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:38.399
What could it be?

00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:44.780
Sorry, Dad.

00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:47.199
What's that date, Dad?

00:14:50.244 --> 00:14:52.121
What are you planning with that jerk?

00:14:57.251 --> 00:14:59.253
It wasn't in the office.
Where's that darn thing?

00:15:22.192 --> 00:15:23.152
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:25.279
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:27.448
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:29.283
So this was it.

00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:52.014
FOCUS ASSEMBLY DEPARTMENT

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.104
This is my father's office.

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:17.122
Oh, wow.

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:21.293
You're distracting me. Stay put, will you?

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:26.673
What on earth?

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:27.841
It's voice-activated.

00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:38.894
Can it follow my movements?

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:44.191
It follows the source of the sound.
My father had it patented.

00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:47.444
Oh, man.

00:16:49.029 --> 00:16:50.364
Here.

00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:52.491
Hey, this is incredible.

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:55.410
My father holds more than 20 patents.

00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:58.080
Inventing stuff is his hobby.

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:01.792
Why does he keep doing things
that don't even make money?

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.129
That's quite a lot.

00:17:05.212 --> 00:17:09.800
Oh, man.
"Lenses, cameras, security alarms…"

00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:16.223
"Micro cooling fan for cameras."

00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:17.683
What's this--

00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:20.769
Small cameras won't function
without devices to cool them down.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.071
Oh, wow.

00:17:31.738 --> 00:17:32.948
Try it over there.

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:38.537
Jeez.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.831
You two are making my head whirl.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.085
DABONTECH, LET'S GO!

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:47.671
-This factory isn't small.
-Not at all.

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.464
-Goodness.
-It's huge.

00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:52.676
-Oh, my.
-Look.

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:54.970
Are all these products ready for sale?

00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:58.307
You must have made all of this
because there's demand.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.975
Well, that's true.

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:04.396
But our buyers are limited to banks,
government offices, or major corporations.

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.899
But who has the mind to buy this now?

00:18:06.982 --> 00:18:09.443
Even machines
are subject to restructuring.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:12.988
What about exporting them?

00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:15.991
Engineers like us
don't know anything about them.

00:18:16.074 --> 00:18:18.952
This won't bring in much
for big companies,

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:20.537
so they never cared.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.665
Security cameras…

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.711
I think it's promising.

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:30.547
Mr. Kang.

00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.966
Which country leads
the security camera market?

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.010
When it comes to cameras,
Japan is the best.

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:37.596
But our technology and quality
doesn't fall behind.

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.598
The price is competitive now, too.

00:18:40.766 --> 00:18:42.935
Yes, it will be neck and neck.

00:18:43.018 --> 00:18:44.519
We've got an edge for sure.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.941
-That glint's back in his eyes.
-I know.

00:18:50.442 --> 00:18:51.818
Tell me, Mr. Kang.

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:54.905
What do you say, want to give it a shot?

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.074
Gosh.

00:18:57.157 --> 00:19:00.244
Considering our finances,
I think we can make a down payment.

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:03.372
Money will go to waste if we don't use it

00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:04.957
the right way.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.458
Seriously, guys.

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:09.920
I'll cherish you as my siblings.

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:14.841
I've always believed
that you should go big or go home.

00:19:16.718 --> 00:19:18.971
-Going big, it is.
-Okay.

00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:20.222
Dad.

00:19:20.305 --> 00:19:22.266
-Go big or go home!
-Go big or go home!

00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:23.684
-Let's go big!
-Dad.

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:25.394
-Let's go big!
-Let's do this!

00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:26.353
All right!

00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:28.063
-You made a fine choice.
-Great!

00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:30.524
You can relax now.

00:19:38.532 --> 00:19:40.617
I'm home. Where's Mi-ho?

00:19:49.459 --> 00:19:52.212
What are you doing, Mi-ho?
Come out for some watermelon.

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:54.381
No thanks, I'm good.

00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:57.384
Aren't you hot at all? Come on, get up.

00:19:57.467 --> 00:19:59.428
I said I'm good. Just leave me be.

00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.555
-What's going on?
-For goodness' sake!

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:05.392
Hey, have you been crying?

00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:08.353
Who did this to you?
Hurry and spill everything!

00:20:08.437 --> 00:20:09.604
Mi-seon.

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:12.524
Wang Nam-mo…

00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:16.486
Wang Nam-mo broke up with me.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.698
-What?
-He said it was all over!

00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:22.159
What? That ugly guy said that?

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:26.788
When did he say that?
After our outing to the beach?

00:20:26.872 --> 00:20:29.458
This is on you
for reaching out to your ex!

00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:31.793
We barely dated for a week.
He hardly counts as one!

00:20:31.877 --> 00:20:33.295
Stop being so silly!

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:36.256
No one's interested in hearing me out.

00:20:37.007 --> 00:20:39.259
I'm saying it's not what it seems, okay?

00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:41.303
I had a plan and everything.

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:44.681
That jerk made the first move,
saying that he had a crush on me.

00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:47.976
Then he had the audacity to dump me!

00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:53.190
Why are you crying?
Can't you live without him or something?

00:20:53.273 --> 00:20:54.358
Whatever, I don't know!

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:55.942
-You foolish girl!
-That hurts!

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:58.195
What was that for, Grandma?

00:20:58.278 --> 00:21:00.530
Serves you right for blindly trusting men!

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:02.532
You'd be better off trusting a cow!

00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:06.661
It helps out with the fieldwork
and never grumbles over food.

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:08.163
She's right.

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:11.124
Nam-mo's a good-for-nothing windbag.

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.502
But all men are like that.

00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:15.003
My son's the only exception.

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.760
I know that, okay?

00:21:22.427 --> 00:21:25.472
But I like him so much.

00:21:26.431 --> 00:21:28.141
Do you know what he said, Mi-seon?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.603
He told me never to go see him again.

00:21:31.686 --> 00:21:34.064
He even turned his phone off!

00:21:34.147 --> 00:21:36.233
Where is he? Lead the way. Get dressed.

00:21:36.316 --> 00:21:39.027
-Get changed. Let's go see him.
-Yes, lead the way.

00:21:39.111 --> 00:21:41.947
We're going after the rascal
who broke her heart!

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.032
Taekwon!

00:21:44.116 --> 00:21:47.744
I could've been green belt by now.
I kept asking to sign me up, didn't I?

00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:49.287
-Let's go!
-Come on out.

00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:51.957
-Get changed and join us.
-Come on, I'm not going!

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.125
I said what I said.

00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:54.793
Come on out and take us to him.

00:21:54.876 --> 00:21:58.004
For goodness' sake,
don't go see him, okay?

00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:00.715
I think we should, though.

00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:03.927
Jeez.

00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:07.180
MOMO'S PUB

00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:11.268
You're the realtor, aren't you?

00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:12.436
This way, please.

00:22:13.478 --> 00:22:15.730
You're Mr. Wang Nam-mo, correct?

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:18.900
-Why didn't you answer your phone?
-Pardon?

00:22:18.984 --> 00:22:20.277
I'm Woo Tae-min.

00:22:21.695 --> 00:22:23.363
Didn't Mi-ho tell you?

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:24.906
XDG ENTERTAINMENT
MANAGER WOO TAE-MIN

00:22:26.116 --> 00:22:29.077
She was so insistent
that I give you a shot.

00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:31.121
I don't get why she didn't tell you.

00:22:31.788 --> 00:22:35.625
I'm in charge of album production,
and Mi-ho filled me in on the backstory.

00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:37.752
We go way back.

00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:40.839
Just so you know,
we're not involved in any way.

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:46.595
Can you sing for me?

00:22:57.314 --> 00:22:59.441
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:03.945
We'll purchase 500 units for starters.

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:07.324
We're new to this market,
so we'll ramp up gradually.

00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:11.161
We'll wire you the down payment
specified here by tomorrow.

00:23:11.244 --> 00:23:14.706
That way, you can clear your debt
and keep the factory and the goods.

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:17.876
I wonder what we could possibly do
to repay your kindness.

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:21.922
Thanks to you, I won't have
to file for bankruptcy.

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:23.506
I don't know how to thank you.

00:23:43.276 --> 00:23:44.277
We'll get going.

00:23:44.361 --> 00:23:45.654
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

00:23:49.783 --> 00:23:52.452
-Take care.
-We'll see you later. Goodbye.

00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:53.536
See you.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.789
Goodbye. Drive safely.

00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:59.668
PAYMENT APPROVAL REQUEST

00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:00.835
STAFF IN CHARGE: OH MI-SEON

00:24:00.919 --> 00:24:02.545
When's the promissory note due?

00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:04.172
Tomorrow.

00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:07.842
MANAGER: GO MA-JIN

00:24:07.926 --> 00:24:09.761
Now, we just have to sell them.

00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:14.724
-Are we all set?
-Well, yes.

00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:15.934
All right, then.

00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:18.103
It's up and running now.

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:21.982
-Mr. Go has approved the payment plan.
-Okay.

00:24:25.026 --> 00:24:28.822
Products like this
have a set pool of potential buyers.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:33.034
Yes, I suggest we sign up for a trade fair
if there's one that suits us.

00:24:33.118 --> 00:24:36.204
I did find a security trade fair
that will be held in Germany.

00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:37.372
-Oh, yeah?
-Sure.

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:40.500
The International Trade Association
might have more information.

00:24:41.084 --> 00:24:42.711
Okay, in that case…

00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:45.547
Come on, Mr. Kang.
That's just too distracting.

00:24:46.548 --> 00:24:50.302
Didn't you say your father held
many more patents on similar inventions?

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:53.471
Sure, he has plenty,
but I don't know the details.

00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:54.848
Why would he

00:24:55.724 --> 00:24:56.891
just sit on the patents

00:24:57.684 --> 00:24:58.893
and not put them to use?

00:24:58.977 --> 00:25:01.187
What can you do with patents
during the IMF?

00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:03.064
Small businesses are lucky
just to survive.

00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:06.026
Because patents are hard
to turn into something practical.

00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:09.821
Technology alone isn't enough.
You need a marketable item to go with it.

00:25:09.904 --> 00:25:11.865
Only big companies launch new products.

00:25:11.948 --> 00:25:13.450
They have a monopoly there.

00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:15.535
Let them take the whole market, jeez!

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:16.828
You're brilliant.

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:21.499
-Who are they to barge in?
-What on earth?

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.337
What the heck?

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.507
What's going on?
We never ordered any furniture.

00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:31.593
Excuse me. Which company are you with?

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:32.719
Who do you work for?

00:25:32.802 --> 00:25:34.554
-Just a minute.
-Hello.

00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:38.266
Greetings, everyone.

00:25:41.144 --> 00:25:42.520
It's nice to see you again.

00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:45.482
Tae-poong. You know why I'm here.

00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:47.859
You had a deal with my father.

00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:50.528
-What are you doing here?
-Where's Tae-poong's seat?

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:52.322
Hold on.

00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:55.075
Who are these people?
And what's this furniture?

00:25:55.158 --> 00:25:56.534
Pack up, everyone.

00:25:56.618 --> 00:25:58.244
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.084
Hang on. What are you doing?

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:07.962
-You can't just barge in like this.
-Move out of the way.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.132
-Move out of the way.
-You can't do this.

00:26:14.928 --> 00:26:16.971
You can't come in like this!

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.188
This isn't right!

00:26:26.231 --> 00:26:27.899
You have no right to do this!

00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:31.403
You can't come crying to me later.

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.904
I offer myself.

00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:34.614
To be exact, my position.

00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:39.786
You'll give up everything
and leave the business alone?

00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:44.124
The position of CEO
at Typhoon Trading, you say?

00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:46.167
Is it a balanced deal now?

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:49.212
Get the hell out!

00:26:52.173 --> 00:26:54.509
Mr. Ha, what's taking
my attorney this long?

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:56.511
Oh, Mr. Choi is just on his way.

00:26:56.594 --> 00:26:59.347
Get to work, everyone.
We're moving into our new office!

00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.141
-Remove junk like this!
-How dare you?

00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:03.184
I work here!

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:05.228
Jeez.

00:27:07.397 --> 00:27:09.649
Jeez, you crass punk.

00:27:10.442 --> 00:27:13.278
Dude, let's take a civilized approach.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.614
Hey.

00:27:17.574 --> 00:27:19.451
What a fine office, huh?

00:27:20.201 --> 00:27:21.411
Would you look at that?

00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:32.130
What was your father like?

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:35.633
I just suddenly got curious.

00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:37.135
What set him so apart?

00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:47.145
You love your old man to death, don't you?

00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:49.772
Cut out the crap
and get to the point, punk.

00:27:49.856 --> 00:27:51.191
I was getting there, punk.

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:54.819
Take a look here.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.113
You wrote it yourself.

00:27:57.864 --> 00:27:59.407
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:00.825
PYO BAK-HO
KANG TAE-POONG

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:05.121
But I didn't miss the meeting.
Your father didn't show up.

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.080
You saw it yourself.

00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:08.875
You got it wrong.
Let me tell you the cold, hard fact.

00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:11.628
You didn't present the promissory note.

00:28:11.711 --> 00:28:14.464
-You only filched my surgical gloves.
-Are you for real?

00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:17.759
Your family borrowed from mine
and never repaid us.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:19.219
Do you have proof?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.263
Well, I have mine.

00:28:23.056 --> 00:28:23.890
Proof?

00:28:25.934 --> 00:28:27.018
Proof?!

00:28:27.894 --> 00:28:31.022
Have you forgotten how you lot ruined
someone for that scrap of paper?

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:34.025
The green juice lady?

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:40.073
I'm going to go get rid of those bastards.

00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:45.078
If you think about it,
you're a selfish jerk.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.456
If you got lost without a fuss,

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.751
everyone outside
could at least keep their jobs.

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:54.462
If you keep being stubborn,

00:28:55.713 --> 00:28:57.382
what do you think will happen?

00:28:58.424 --> 00:29:00.468
"Shall not be impacted in any way."

00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:04.472
Screw that. I'll kick everyone
out on the street.

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:05.515
Hey.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.268
It's your choice.

00:29:21.072 --> 00:29:24.742
So, you'll be satisfied once I'm gone?

00:29:26.327 --> 00:29:27.829
Don't make me waste my breath.

00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:29.581
Mr. Choi!

00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:31.291
Come in.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:34.294
It's just a standard resignation letter.

00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:35.795
Please sign it.

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:40.550
When is my last working time?

00:29:40.633 --> 00:29:42.385
Right this moment.

00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:44.387
It's 4:57 p.m.

00:29:51.686 --> 00:29:52.854
Let's make it 5:00 p.m.

00:29:55.648 --> 00:29:57.108
That'd be 17:00, correct?

00:29:58.067 --> 00:29:59.736
Look at you, minding the details.

00:29:59.819 --> 00:30:03.406
FINAL WORKING DAY AND TIME:
AT 17:00 ON JUNE 30, 1998

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:11.748
CEO: KANG TAE-POONG
COMPANY: TYPHOON TRADING

00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:13.499
We need your company's seal.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.781
Stop staring and get the hell out.

00:30:44.864 --> 00:30:47.241
Not a speck of dust here belongs to you.

00:30:47.325 --> 00:30:48.284
I know that.

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:51.829
You'd better keep your word.

00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:55.333
Don't mess with anything here.

00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:57.543
Leave everyone alone
and uphold their contracts.

00:30:58.544 --> 00:31:00.380
Don't you dare make a single change.

00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.340
Got that?

00:31:02.966 --> 00:31:04.258
I'm a CEO too.

00:31:05.093 --> 00:31:08.054
The CEO of Typhoon Trading.

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:13.226
Why, you little bastard!

00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:14.894
Get me the sign-off binder!

00:31:17.522 --> 00:31:19.107
-What are you doing?
-Stop him!

00:31:42.171 --> 00:31:44.799
WE SEEK YOUR APPROVAL ON THIS PAYMENT
JUNE 30, 1998

00:31:47.343 --> 00:31:48.219
No!

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:50.805
Hey.

00:31:50.888 --> 00:31:52.640
I stamped the seal before 5:00 p.m.

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:55.018
Out of my way, darn it.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.283
Ms. Oh.

00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:14.120
Thank you for your hard work.

00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:16.330
What?

00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:20.585
-Mr. Kang.
-Mr. Kang.

00:32:20.668 --> 00:32:23.004
Hey, what's happening? What's going on?

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.684
-Mr. Kang.
-Tell us what's up.

00:32:36.768 --> 00:32:38.144
No, I'm not letting you go.

00:32:39.103 --> 00:32:41.481
Get back and take your seat
in the CEO's office.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.108
You're the CEO here!

00:32:44.192 --> 00:32:45.777
The CEO of Typhoon Trading!

00:32:51.407 --> 00:32:53.409
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:55.286
Just why…

00:32:55.828 --> 00:32:57.288
Why are you making that face?

00:32:57.872 --> 00:33:00.124
It's all good. Just get inside already.

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:04.796
I'm sorry, I can't.

00:33:14.138 --> 00:33:16.140
Please don't go.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.981
Please.

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:39.288
Today is going to be…

00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:44.961
the last day of work for me.

00:33:46.003 --> 00:33:47.004
Wait.

00:33:49.465 --> 00:33:50.550
Please stay on

00:33:51.592 --> 00:33:52.927
until the very end…

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.849
and protect the company.

00:33:59.851 --> 00:34:00.768
But…

00:34:07.358 --> 00:34:08.860
I'll leave it in your hands.

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:19.537
-Wait.
-No, Mr. Kang!

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.165
-Tae-poong!
-Let me go talk to him.

00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:26.002
Wait. Hold on, Mr. Kang.

00:34:26.085 --> 00:34:27.086
Just a second.

00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:30.798
Why are you just taking off?

00:34:30.882 --> 00:34:31.841
Ms. Oh.

00:34:32.717 --> 00:34:34.135
Please see our deal through.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.470
Get back there. Everyone's waiting.

00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:39.432
No, I won't.
That's not the issue right now.

00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:56.240
Please don't go.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.119
That was all I could do
as the CEO of our company.

00:35:00.953 --> 00:35:02.955
Stay and talk to me for one moment.

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:04.874
That's all I ask. Please.

00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:06.751
Please…

00:35:07.418 --> 00:35:08.586
I'd better get going.

00:35:12.256 --> 00:35:13.382
Oh, no.

00:35:26.562 --> 00:35:27.521
What do I…

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:35.196
How will the family
go on without their breadwinner?

00:35:36.864 --> 00:35:39.867
He's had a fine life
as the little prince of Gangnam.

00:35:41.494 --> 00:35:42.703
Well…

00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:46.123
I want to learn how to do my job.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.545
You're the only one I can ask for help.

00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:53.089
Please help me.

00:35:53.172 --> 00:35:55.591
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

00:35:56.217 --> 00:35:57.468
Is it working?

00:35:57.551 --> 00:35:58.803
-Tae-poong?
-Yes?

00:35:58.886 --> 00:36:01.430
-Have you called Pusan?
-I'm doing it now.

00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:09.021
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

00:36:10.147 --> 00:36:12.984
"Burned it all… down to pure white."

00:36:13.067 --> 00:36:14.652
You're the CEO now.

00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.570
But I have no employees…

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:19.657
or any money…

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.995
or any things to sell.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:26.330
But what I'm trying to say is,

00:36:26.414 --> 00:36:27.540
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

00:36:30.626 --> 00:36:31.877
Will you come and work…

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.715
for Typhoon Trading…

00:36:37.758 --> 00:36:39.343
as a trader?

00:36:49.854 --> 00:36:53.899
Shoe Park's Safety Shoes.

00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:02.950
I smell, don't I?

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.913
Play the CD.

00:37:07.997 --> 00:37:09.832
-Our Prophet is--
-Mr. Koo!

00:37:11.334 --> 00:37:13.169
Please help us out.

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:14.962
Please help Typhoon Trading.

00:37:20.217 --> 00:37:21.510
Mi-seon.

00:37:26.682 --> 00:37:28.059
-What did you say? Ouch!
-Wait.

00:37:28.142 --> 00:37:30.895
-Are you okay? What happened?
-Wait. Darn it.

00:37:30.978 --> 00:37:33.814
Are you okay… Is the car okay?

00:37:35.608 --> 00:37:37.818
Give up what? Your position as the CEO?

00:37:37.902 --> 00:37:39.862
What are you talking about?

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:43.616
Well, I couldn't sit around
and let the business go bankrupt.

00:37:44.533 --> 00:37:45.826
I can't help it.

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:47.370
This is who I am.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.166
That was all I could do
as the CEO of our company.

00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.877
The one you really like?

00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:57.588
The one I love.

00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:41.382
Where do I go now?

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:51.642
I am rooting for your dream.

00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:52.852
Dad…

00:38:52.935 --> 00:38:53.853
You are always

00:38:53.936 --> 00:38:56.147
my most beloved person.

00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:58.691
Remember.

00:38:59.316 --> 00:39:01.610
People are more important than results.

00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:04.738
We are more fragrant than flowers

00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:07.283
and more valuable than money.

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:10.161
This is my wish.

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:31.891
Okay, first things first.

00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:36.061
Even on his way out,
the guy stamped the seal

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.190
and signed our payment request.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.444
Mr. Kang did so much for me.
I feel so terrible.

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:46.322
That's the man Mr. Kang is.

00:39:46.405 --> 00:39:47.323
You're right.

00:39:49.158 --> 00:39:50.326
As for us,

00:39:52.244 --> 00:39:53.829
we'll protect the company at all costs.

00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:55.206
I'm so touched.

00:39:57.958 --> 00:39:58.876
Let's go.

00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:00.669
Move the sofa inside.

00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:02.129
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:21.815
Hey, Mi-ho.

00:40:25.653 --> 00:40:27.488
Take this. I don't need it anyway.

00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:31.534
XDG ENTERTAINMENT
MANAGER WOO TAE-MIN

00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:33.410
Why not?

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.164
This is a solid company,
and he's a hotshot over there.

00:40:37.248 --> 00:40:41.001
Hey, do you take me for a pathetic loser
who'd gladly accept help from your ex?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.755
Do you think I'm an idiot
because I keep on smiling?

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:46.465
You got it all wrong.

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:48.551
I only wanted to help you
realize your dream.

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:50.177
My dream

00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:52.930
is to make you happy.

00:40:54.056 --> 00:40:55.224
That's all I wanted.

00:40:57.017 --> 00:40:57.851
I'm off.

00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:00.938
Hey.

00:41:01.605 --> 00:41:02.606
Hey, Wang Nam-mo!

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:10.155
Do you honestly think you can be happy

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:14.535
when you are begrudgingly slogging away
after giving up your dream?

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:19.290
Aren't you the one
who thinks I'm an idiot?

00:41:19.373 --> 00:41:20.958
I walk on eggshells around you too!

00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:22.751
When did I ever make you do that?

00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:25.462
You always play the guitar
and sing at the pub.

00:41:25.546 --> 00:41:28.591
I know that's your real passion.
Don't use me as your excuse!

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.260
That's a huge turnoff.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.640
I've had enough. Let's end it for real.

00:41:38.392 --> 00:41:40.227
I dumped you, got it? Don't call me.

00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:27.024
Tae-poong.

00:42:36.784 --> 00:42:39.828
Why didn't you answer your phone?
You had me worried.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.457
Have you had dinner?

00:42:45.084 --> 00:42:46.001
I'm sorry.

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:53.342
What were you doing out here?
What was on your mind?

00:42:54.885 --> 00:42:55.719
Well…

00:42:57.513 --> 00:42:58.681
I couldn't come up with

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:01.809
what I should do

00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:04.520
or where I should go.

00:43:05.354 --> 00:43:06.313
That's all.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.569
It's really tricky.

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:15.030
You're officially unemployed, Tae-poong.

00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:18.742
You're right.

00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:29.878
This time, you really have no employees

00:43:29.962 --> 00:43:32.798
or any money or any things to sell.

00:43:34.299 --> 00:43:35.175
And now,

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.302
no company.

00:43:40.097 --> 00:43:42.266
Still, hear me out, Tae-poong.

00:43:45.853 --> 00:43:46.937
Even if

00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:49.606
things look very bleak…

00:43:50.524 --> 00:43:52.151
we will always

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.320
be waiting for your return.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.118
So would you…

00:44:03.537 --> 00:44:06.206
continue to be the CEO of Typhoon Trading?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.802
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:33.484
I would gladly do so

00:44:35.694 --> 00:44:37.279
if I ever get that honor again.

00:45:39.758 --> 00:45:41.677
Wait for me, Dad.

00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:45.347
I won't ever give up.

00:46:00.153 --> 00:46:02.364
CEO PYO HYUN-JUN

00:46:02.447 --> 00:46:04.366
Could I get approval
to take out the bankbook?

00:46:05.826 --> 00:46:07.536
For Dabontech?

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:11.164
It's the last day for bill repayment,
so let's move quickly.

00:46:11.248 --> 00:46:14.710
Okay, give me a moment.

00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:23.343
BANKBOOK RELEASE REQUEST

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.013
What are you doing?

00:46:26.096 --> 00:46:29.349
I'm drawing up the form
for the bankbook release.

00:46:29.433 --> 00:46:30.267
What?

00:46:30.851 --> 00:46:32.102
You need approval first.

00:46:32.811 --> 00:46:35.105
Why are you making a new form?

00:46:35.188 --> 00:46:37.441
I told you we were in a hurry,

00:46:37.524 --> 00:46:39.568
and that's how you go about it.

00:46:39.651 --> 00:46:41.903
STAFF IN CHARGE, MANAGER,
GENERAL MANAGER, DIRECTOR, CEO

00:46:50.287 --> 00:46:51.955
-All set.
-You done?

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:53.373
-I'm done.
-Okay.

00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:01.673
We need five signatures now?
They're doing this on purpose.

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.717
I'll go get his signature.

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:16.855
BUSINESS LICENSE

00:47:16.938 --> 00:47:18.523
TYPHOON TRADING
PYO HYUN-JUN

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:19.566
Hey, Freckles.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.693
What do you think? Is it hanging straight?

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.739
I need your approval
to take out our bankbook.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:28.283
Really?

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.833
All right, then.

00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:44.299
Why don't you go get me
a refreshing chilled coffee?

00:47:46.343 --> 00:47:48.136
You look like you're ready
to throw a punch.

00:47:48.637 --> 00:47:50.347
Did I ever say I wouldn't sign it?

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:56.687
Let's take it easy
and relax a little, okay?

00:47:57.771 --> 00:48:00.982
Go get me that coffee already
if you want the bankbook.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.459
Here. Hope it helps with your repayment.

00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:30.804
BUHO MUTUAL SAVINGS BANK

00:48:57.956 --> 00:49:00.083
Hello? Did Mr. Bae enter the bank?

00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:04.796
-Yes, just now.
-All right.

00:49:06.214 --> 00:49:07.758
I'll return to the office now.

00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:08.800
Okay.

00:49:10.594 --> 00:49:11.845
He's reached the bank.

00:49:16.224 --> 00:49:18.059
-Let's go!
-All right!

00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:23.648
Did it go well?

00:49:23.732 --> 00:49:26.276
It did. It's all sorted out.

00:49:32.824 --> 00:49:35.160
MR. BAE OF DABON

00:49:36.495 --> 00:49:38.497
Mr. Kang, we've got a problem.

00:49:39.664 --> 00:49:42.542
The bank closed early,
and I couldn't make the payment.

00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:44.753
What do I do now?

00:49:56.139 --> 00:49:59.893
APPLICATION FOR DESIGNATION
OF BUHO BANK AS PRINCIPAL BANK

00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:05.398
APPLIED BY: MARK CHOI

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.071
Dominion Rex Group could've partnered
with any other commercial banks.

00:50:11.655 --> 00:50:15.742
And yet, you chose our mutual savings bank
as your principal bank.

00:50:16.868 --> 00:50:17.994
It's an honor.

00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:20.664
Foreigners tend to be
more well-informed in finance.

00:50:20.747 --> 00:50:22.582
-You know how they are.
-Of course.

00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:25.502
I hope we can attract
more foreign customers.

00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:27.587
By the way, Mr. Kim…

00:50:28.505 --> 00:50:31.383
Remember Dabontech,
the company I asked you about earlier?

00:50:32.133 --> 00:50:34.511
How are things going for them?

00:50:34.594 --> 00:50:36.930
Their promissory note is due today.

00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.433
Unfortunately,

00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:45.647
the internal affairs of our branch
forced us to close a bit earlier today.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.566
What a pity.

00:50:48.733 --> 00:50:50.402
They're in for big trouble.

00:50:55.782 --> 00:50:56.700
Mr. Bae.

00:50:57.784 --> 00:50:58.660
What do I do?

00:50:58.743 --> 00:51:00.662
-They won't take the money.
-What?

00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:03.498
You couldn't make the payment?

00:51:03.582 --> 00:51:09.754
The official business hours
of this bank are until 4:30 p.m.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.717
They apparently closed an hour early.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.802
That means

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:17.846
it's all over.

00:51:17.929 --> 00:51:19.055
So they're closed?

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:22.267
They

00:51:23.393 --> 00:51:25.103
declared my company bankrupt.

00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:27.480
How could this happen?

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.483
-How heartless.
-Mr. Bae.

00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:33.194
Stay put and don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

00:51:33.278 --> 00:51:34.571
Stay right here.

00:51:38.116 --> 00:51:39.659
-We're closed for the day.
-Oh…

00:51:40.285 --> 00:51:41.369
I won't take long.

00:51:41.453 --> 00:51:42.871
-I only need a minute.
-I'm sorry.

00:51:42.954 --> 00:51:44.539
I'm only following orders.

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:06.227
Let's head back, sir.

00:52:06.311 --> 00:52:08.730
Excuse me.
Are you from Buho Mutual Savings Bank?

00:52:08.813 --> 00:52:10.231
Yes, we are.

00:52:10.315 --> 00:52:11.942
Dabontech was declared bankrupt

00:52:12.025 --> 00:52:14.235
because they couldn't
honor their promissory note today.

00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:15.654
It's still during business hours.

00:52:15.737 --> 00:52:18.281
If you let us in,
we can make the payment right away.

00:52:18.865 --> 00:52:20.742
We're closed for the day.

00:52:20.825 --> 00:52:22.535
-Excuse us.
-Wait.

00:52:24.245 --> 00:52:26.623
One company's fate hangs in the balance.

00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:30.919
If a factory worth hundreds of millions
of won is lost over just 30 million,

00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:33.922
all its employees and their families
will end up suffering.

00:52:36.633 --> 00:52:38.176
Please help us just this once.

00:52:38.802 --> 00:52:40.261
I humbly ask for your help.

00:52:40.345 --> 00:52:43.014
Don't let them bother you, Mr. Kim.
Let's go inside.

00:52:44.265 --> 00:52:48.269
Businesses with improper management
dragged the country into the IMF crisis.

00:52:48.353 --> 00:52:51.231
You shouldn't be running a factory
worth hundreds of millions of won

00:52:51.314 --> 00:52:52.899
when you don't have 30 million.

00:52:52.983 --> 00:52:55.527
You brought on the economic bubble,
crippled our society,

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.070
and ruined our country.

00:52:57.654 --> 00:52:59.781
-You should be ashamed.
-After you, sir.

00:53:00.407 --> 00:53:01.783
You're talking about shame?

00:53:01.866 --> 00:53:02.742
Shame?

00:53:03.284 --> 00:53:04.744
Listen, mister!

00:53:05.328 --> 00:53:07.497
Our society has indeed been crippled,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.333
but that's not because
of the hard-working people.

00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:14.045
It's because of opportunistic crooks
who prey upon them for easy money!

00:53:15.547 --> 00:53:17.799
For your information,
the country is still standing tall.

00:53:27.892 --> 00:53:32.147
-What do you think you're doing?!
-Stick to your business hours first!

00:53:37.152 --> 00:53:38.236
Listen.

00:53:38.903 --> 00:53:40.155
Things sure look fishy.

00:53:40.822 --> 00:53:43.992
The factory site belongs
to the company as well, right?

00:53:44.075 --> 00:53:46.036
That alone is a huge sum.

00:53:46.119 --> 00:53:49.456
And yet, they proceeded
to declare bankruptcy right away.

00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:50.874
I don't get it either.

00:53:50.957 --> 00:53:53.460
We have the machines
and countless products inside.

00:53:53.543 --> 00:53:54.669
That does seem fishy,

00:53:55.462 --> 00:53:58.506
but what I find odd
is that I ran into Hyun-jun there.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.926
Why would they harass
a small company like my father's?

00:54:02.969 --> 00:54:03.928
Don't cry.

00:54:07.182 --> 00:54:08.933
Where's Mr. Koo, by the way?

00:54:09.017 --> 00:54:11.603
-Mr. Kang! Ms. Oh!
-Hello, Mr. Koo.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.275
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:54:17.817 --> 00:54:20.153
Goodness, what's with the getup?

00:54:20.236 --> 00:54:24.032
They reassigned this guy
to Pyo Merchant Marine's security team.

00:54:24.115 --> 00:54:25.867
-What?
-What a load of jerks.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.869
His uniform doesn't even fit him.

00:54:27.952 --> 00:54:29.746
Are those capri pants or what?

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:33.541
He's not the most affluent-looking guy,
and they made him look shabbier.

00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:36.920
How did your father's company
end up going bankrupt anyway?

00:54:42.967 --> 00:54:43.968
-What the…
-They're here!

00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:45.428
-Come on out!
-Join us!

00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:46.638
Quickly!

00:54:46.721 --> 00:54:48.598
My gosh. What do we do?

00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:51.392
Let's all link arms.

00:54:52.811 --> 00:54:54.270
Oh, no…

00:54:57.524 --> 00:55:00.193
-Move out of the way.
-Wait.

00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:12.413
What is all this?

00:55:12.497 --> 00:55:14.124
Stop it, will you?

00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:15.917
-Who are you with?
-Move!

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.002
At least state where you're from first!

00:55:19.295 --> 00:55:21.172
I'm an officer of the district court.

00:55:21.673 --> 00:55:22.882
What about these people?

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:26.302
I want anyone who's not here
on official duty off our property.

00:55:26.386 --> 00:55:29.514
We wouldn't need extra help
if you didn't get in my team's way.

00:55:30.598 --> 00:55:32.433
Sirs, please stay in the courtyard.

00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:36.479
As of this moment,
all items inside this factory

00:55:36.563 --> 00:55:40.400
shall not be moved, taken out,
or used without proper authorization.

00:55:40.483 --> 00:55:45.113
We'll now begin the seizure
and the appraisal for auction.

00:55:46.197 --> 00:55:47.365
Let's get to work.

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:52.704
-Please keep an eye on them, Mr. Bae.
-Understood.

00:55:52.787 --> 00:55:53.997
It's going to be fine, sir.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.373
Goodness.

00:55:55.456 --> 00:55:56.624
Take it slow, will you?

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.214
-You've got something to say, huh?
-No, not exactly.

00:56:05.049 --> 00:56:06.759
EXERCISING RIGHT OF RETENTION

00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:08.928
Is this really necessary?

00:56:10.138 --> 00:56:11.306
Don't take it down.

00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:12.682
Step aside.

00:56:12.765 --> 00:56:13.975
Don't touch it.

00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:21.733
You can't touch this anymore.

00:56:21.816 --> 00:56:24.485
If we can't keep the machines running,
they'll get rusty.

00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:27.572
Don't tag every item.

00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:29.699
The downtime will damage these machines.

00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:31.784
Excuse me, Officer.

00:56:31.868 --> 00:56:34.370
Can't we let them run
for the sake of maintenance?

00:56:34.996 --> 00:56:35.997
That's not possible.

00:56:40.293 --> 00:56:43.213
You can always count on Tae-poong
to meddle when he's not wanted.

00:56:43.296 --> 00:56:47.508
Dude, everything here will belong to me
once the company assets are auctioned off.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.428
You're buying them?

00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:52.847
Don't leave anything out of the appraisal.

00:58:07.005 --> 00:58:09.424
SEIZED

00:58:14.053 --> 00:58:16.139
-Wait, Mr. Kang. Give me some room.
-Okay.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:28.484
It's just odd whichever way I look at it.

00:58:28.568 --> 00:58:29.527
I agree.

00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:32.155
Why are we scrubbing the parts
in the dead of night?

00:58:32.238 --> 00:58:34.824
You heard how the idling machines
could easily break down.

00:58:34.907 --> 00:58:35.908
This is maintenance.

00:58:35.992 --> 00:58:39.120
I get that it's necessary,
but why are we the ones…

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.373
We should take it on, I guess?

00:58:42.457 --> 00:58:45.126
Of course. We're family.

00:58:45.209 --> 00:58:46.461
-Of course.
-Look.

00:58:47.086 --> 00:58:50.923
I still don't get why Hyun-jun
is participating in the auction.

00:58:51.674 --> 00:58:53.009
Why is he taking part?

00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:56.387
He lost interest and spent his time
in the back of his car later on.

00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:57.639
What's his name…

00:58:58.598 --> 00:59:01.517
Was it Mark? That guy came in
and spent a while in the office.

00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:02.935
Yes, right there.

00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:06.606
Why did Hyun-jun bring people
from a foreign company?

00:59:13.613 --> 00:59:14.947
There you go.

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:26.751
Why do you keep
scratching your hands, Mr. Go?

00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:29.253
-It's all because of me.
-Not at all.

00:59:29.837 --> 00:59:30.922
Don't get me started.

00:59:31.547 --> 00:59:37.512
Those jerks kept badgering Ms. Oh
to get them coffee or wash their dishes.

00:59:38.179 --> 00:59:40.264
-I couldn't stand it.
-He took care of everything.

00:59:40.348 --> 00:59:42.016
So I took care of everything.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.518
I'm doing fine.

00:59:43.601 --> 00:59:45.103
-Are your hands okay?
-Mine are fine.

00:59:45.186 --> 00:59:46.896
-He did all the work.
-I developed eczema.

00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:48.898
-I didn't do any of the work.
-Still…

00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:51.150
I'm the one who got dermatitis eczema.

00:59:51.734 --> 00:59:52.652
I did.

00:59:52.735 --> 00:59:54.278
-Will you scratch them for me?
-Sure.

00:59:57.365 --> 00:59:58.533
I actually feel better.

00:59:58.616 --> 00:59:59.659
It's actually helpful…

00:59:59.742 --> 01:00:00.910
Hey, Seon-taek.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.623
-Ms. Cha.
-How…

01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:12.588
Song-jung's mother asked me
to bring you some snacks.

01:00:12.672 --> 01:00:15.883
Why are you even here, lady?

01:00:15.967 --> 01:00:16.968
Mr. Bae!

01:00:17.969 --> 01:00:21.180
-It's not what you think. I just--
-No.

01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:23.850
I asked him for a favor.

01:00:25.977 --> 01:00:27.770
-Ms. Cha.
-Thank…

01:00:35.862 --> 01:00:36.946
Thank you for these.

01:00:37.739 --> 01:00:39.991
Please don't misunderstand, Mr. Koo.

01:00:40.074 --> 01:00:41.284
-We all know--
-Why, you!

01:00:41.367 --> 01:00:44.036
-We know things are rough for her.
-That's enough.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.916
Our priority is handling the obstacle
right in front of us.

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:52.336
Let's circle back to what you were saying.

01:00:52.879 --> 01:00:56.257
That Mark guy seems to be the one
eyeing this company.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.177
It's even odder that a foreigner
would take an interest.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.721
Right, when we visited
Pyo Merchant Marine's office,

01:01:01.804 --> 01:01:05.057
weren't those guys shaking hands
with a contract between them?

01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:06.893
What?

01:01:08.102 --> 01:01:09.103
Where's Mr. Pyo?

01:01:10.396 --> 01:01:12.648
You're right.

01:01:12.732 --> 01:01:14.859
In that case, that document
will give us an answer.

01:01:15.818 --> 01:01:17.153
How would we find it?

01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:19.197
Are you suggesting we commit burglary?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.240
Let's not stoop so low
as to become criminals.

01:01:21.324 --> 01:01:24.535
What do you mean? All we'll be doing
is taking a tour of the place.

01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:25.870
Mr. Koo's right.

01:01:25.953 --> 01:01:28.664
Technically, we're an affiliate
of Pyo Merchant Marine.

01:01:29.624 --> 01:01:32.877
All right, fine. Then…

01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:34.962
Why don't we make a move?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.215
We'll have to take a look.

01:01:37.757 --> 01:01:39.842
Let's start by looking for the key.

01:01:40.426 --> 01:01:41.928
I know where the key is.

01:01:45.097 --> 01:01:45.932
Where's Myung-gwan?

01:01:46.015 --> 01:01:48.351
Oh, Mr. Koo?
He's on the night shift tonight.

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:50.269
He was running late and dashed away.

01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:52.230
-Are you sure you're fine?
-Of course.

01:01:52.313 --> 01:01:54.482
If that jerk, Hyun-jun,
harasses you again--

01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:57.109
-I'll tell you right away.
-I'm being serious.

01:01:57.193 --> 01:01:58.694
This is nerve-racking for me.

01:01:58.778 --> 01:02:00.822
You're worrying over nothing.

01:02:08.538 --> 01:02:11.332
You two are walking
unusually close together.

01:02:11.415 --> 01:02:12.792
The alley's too narrow.

01:02:13.292 --> 01:02:14.961
-It's broad as it can be.
-Really?

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.338
-Keep some distance, okay?
-Okay.

01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:18.631
Move away some more.

01:02:20.842 --> 01:02:23.469
Be careful, okay?
You could end up catching feelings.

01:02:24.178 --> 01:02:26.347
Your focus should be
on your career, Ms. Oh.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:27.723
We can't have you fall in love.

01:02:28.558 --> 01:02:30.351
-Let's be careful, okay?
-Of course.

01:02:30.434 --> 01:02:32.478
All right, then. After you.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.983
-This isn't the time for romance, okay?
-Of course.

01:02:37.942 --> 01:02:38.985
What's wrong?

01:02:39.485 --> 01:02:41.988
I wondered if you were feeling okay
because you kept fidgeting.

01:02:42.613 --> 01:02:43.531
Never mind.

01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:49.245
Mr. Kang seems to be in a strange mood.

01:03:07.763 --> 01:03:09.682
Freckles, fetch us some iced coffee.

01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:12.935
No, stay put.

01:03:13.019 --> 01:03:14.270
-Oh, no.
-No, stay seated.

01:03:14.353 --> 01:03:15.605
-I'll do it.
-But your hands…

01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:17.231
Don't they sting?

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.436
Jeez.

01:03:58.147 --> 01:04:03.110
I need iced coffee prepared by Freckles
to start my day in a great mood.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.615
-We don't want your luxury suit stained--
-Give it a rest, can't you?

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:09.992
-You're too much, Mr. Go.
-No, thanks.

01:04:11.494 --> 01:04:13.663
I told you he doesn't drink it.

01:04:14.956 --> 01:04:16.624
How many times must I remind you?

01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:19.377
Oops.

01:04:20.044 --> 01:04:22.463
-Ms. Oh!
-You did that on purpose, didn't you?

01:04:22.546 --> 01:04:23.589
What's the matter?

01:04:23.673 --> 01:04:25.049
-Ms. Oh, how could you…
-My gosh!

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.884
-Oh, dear.
-You made me look like a clown.

01:04:26.968 --> 01:04:29.053
Seriously, Ms. Oh.
You shouldn't have done that.

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:30.137
Darn it.

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:33.140
-So annoying.
-Oh, no.

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:34.809
Come on, Ms. Oh.

01:04:35.768 --> 01:04:36.936
I bet she did it on purpose.

01:04:39.563 --> 01:04:40.856
Hey, it's a drone!

01:04:42.358 --> 01:04:43.943
-North Korea!
-North Korea?

01:04:44.026 --> 01:04:45.361
-It must be them!
-What?

01:04:45.444 --> 01:04:47.488
Can it be the armed communists' doing?

01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:48.781
-Look!
-Armed communists…

01:04:49.365 --> 01:04:50.199
Look, everyone.

01:04:50.282 --> 01:04:52.743
North Korea! Look.

01:04:53.536 --> 01:04:55.496
-North Korea!
-My gosh!

01:04:55.579 --> 01:04:57.248
The communists…

01:04:57.832 --> 01:05:00.793
-North Korean spies?
-What's that?

01:05:02.712 --> 01:05:05.589
-Wait, was North Korea in that direction?
-That direction?

01:05:05.673 --> 01:05:09.468
My gosh, look at the beautiful harmony
of the leaves and flowers.

01:05:09.552 --> 01:05:10.511
It's almost summer.

01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:14.140
-What's his deal?
-Oh, boy.

01:05:29.989 --> 01:05:31.407
SEIZED

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:33.784
MONITORING 24-7

01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:45.713
Great.

01:05:54.930 --> 01:05:56.807
Get a load of him, looking all sharp.

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.476
We're only delivering justice.

01:05:58.559 --> 01:06:01.479
All right, then. We'll see you in an hour.

01:06:02.438 --> 01:06:03.773
Team, to your positions!

01:06:28.964 --> 01:06:30.299
We'll go up.

01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:32.968
You two, go to that punk's room.

01:06:33.052 --> 01:06:34.720
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

01:06:42.978 --> 01:06:44.939
Keep a close eye on things, Mr. Bae.

01:06:45.022 --> 01:06:46.190
Where are you going?

01:06:47.566 --> 01:06:48.567
It's patrol time.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.403
I should perform my duty.

01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.489
Okay.

01:06:54.448 --> 01:06:57.076
Man, long-timers sure
have a different mindset.

01:06:57.159 --> 01:06:59.829
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

01:07:06.168 --> 01:07:07.628
Okay, let's search the place.

01:07:09.255 --> 01:07:10.422
All right.

01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:20.766
What the heck?

01:07:21.642 --> 01:07:24.103
He never works.
Why does he have so many files?

01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:28.816
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

01:07:55.217 --> 01:07:56.343
Where am I?

01:07:57.052 --> 01:07:58.470
All corners look the same.

01:08:17.573 --> 01:08:19.241
Are they raising an animal?

01:08:26.665 --> 01:08:28.125
The whole pile…

01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:29.543
Darn it.

01:08:36.133 --> 01:08:38.344
-Why is this here?
-What?

01:08:42.264 --> 01:08:44.642
-That crazy bastard!
-What's wrong?

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:46.435
-What's the matter?
-Look at this.

01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:48.062
-Seriously.
-What the…

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:49.313
It's my dad's nameplate.

01:08:49.396 --> 01:08:50.397
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

01:08:51.148 --> 01:08:52.149
Is someone there?

01:08:53.275 --> 01:08:54.860
We have to hide.

01:08:54.944 --> 01:08:56.570
-Hide yourself.
-Let's lie down.

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:04.912
Break-in suspected in the main building.

01:09:05.496 --> 01:09:08.123
Break-in suspected in the main building.
Send backup.

01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:10.751
Break-in suspected in the main building.
Send backup.

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:19.802
Security team,
report to the main building.

01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:23.597
Security team,
report to the main building.

01:09:25.557 --> 01:09:27.977
-We're in the clear.
-Really? Has he left?

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.103
I think he's gone.

01:09:40.239 --> 01:09:41.156
-What's wrong?
-Let's…

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.158
-Let's stop by at the CEO's office.
-Okay.

01:09:47.871 --> 01:09:49.707
Who's that? Who's there?

01:09:53.752 --> 01:09:54.962
Ms. Cha?

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:58.674
-What are you doing here?
-I lied, saying I had to make a delivery.

01:09:58.757 --> 01:10:01.927
This is the CEO's office.
Anything of value should be here.

01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:03.554
The guards are coming. Let's leave.

01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:05.639
Never mind me. You two should get going.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:06.932
I can say I'm here for work.

01:10:07.016 --> 01:10:09.184
-Go on, leave.
-No, come with us.

01:10:09.268 --> 01:10:12.771
-Ms. Oh, let's head out first.
-Nonsense. We have to leave together.

01:10:12.855 --> 01:10:14.315
You should come too, Ms. Cha.

01:10:14.398 --> 01:10:15.691
We've got to leave.

01:10:15.774 --> 01:10:17.234
-Come on.
-Who's that?

01:10:17.318 --> 01:10:18.569
Wait!

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:20.446
Mr. Kang!

01:10:20.529 --> 01:10:21.655
You bastard!

01:10:29.455 --> 01:10:31.206
Watch out, Mr. Kang! He's behind you!

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.667
Oh, no.

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:34.877
Hey!

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.712
-What the…
-Ms. Cha!

01:10:39.256 --> 01:10:41.216
-Let go!
-Don't hurt her!

01:10:53.479 --> 01:10:55.230
-Mr. Kang!
-You bastards.

01:10:58.525 --> 01:11:01.904
I served with the 498th class
of the Korean Marine Corps. Get going.

01:11:01.987 --> 01:11:03.447
Go. Hurry!

01:11:04.114 --> 01:11:06.033
Is that a uniform? I can't believe it.

01:11:06.116 --> 01:11:06.950
Jeez.

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:08.911
Count yourselves lucky.

01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:11.997
Hey, that's Mr. Go.

01:11:12.623 --> 01:11:15.751
DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROL PANEL

01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:26.178
Hey, they're downstairs!

01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:28.013
-Go after them.
-Hurry, Mr. Go!

01:11:39.483 --> 01:11:40.359
All right!

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.946
This way.

01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:45.155
Hurry up!

01:11:53.497 --> 01:11:55.332
This is why you need
quality security cameras.

01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:57.209
Your cheap cameras
can't catch a thing now.

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:59.586
-What happened?
-Why did the lights go out?

01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.964
-Hurry.
-You damn bastards!

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:07.094
-Ms. Cha!
-What's going on?

01:12:18.439 --> 01:12:19.982
-Hey.
-Mr. Kang.

01:12:20.065 --> 01:12:22.067
-Hurry!
-Run!

01:12:22.151 --> 01:12:23.402
Quickly!

01:12:23.485 --> 01:12:25.320
-Ms. Cha!
-Run for your life!

01:12:27.614 --> 01:12:29.324
Hurry! Hurry up!

01:12:31.618 --> 01:12:34.079
Hurry up! Quickly!

01:12:40.836 --> 01:12:44.381
Just go. Move!

01:12:44.465 --> 01:12:45.466
Help her.

01:12:45.549 --> 01:12:46.967
-But they're…
-Darn it.

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.635
Hey, wait for me. Oh, shoot.

01:12:55.058 --> 01:12:56.268
Are you okay?

01:12:58.103 --> 01:12:59.480
What about you?

01:13:02.566 --> 01:13:03.567
Gosh.

01:13:04.526 --> 01:13:06.361
Great work tonight.

01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:08.697
I brought some red ginseng drinks
to boost your energy.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.115
-That's lovely.
-Thank you.

01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:11.617
Here, here.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.784
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:14.369
Your flying kick was amazing, Mr. Go.

01:13:15.037 --> 01:13:17.164
-I sure showed them.
-Here you go, Ms. Cha.

01:13:17.748 --> 01:13:18.749
I'll take a pass.

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:22.836
Come on, Seon-taek.
Drink this before you go.

01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:24.379
Ms. Cha.

01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.870
What's up? Did you find something?

01:13:57.996 --> 01:13:58.830
What is it?

01:14:00.832 --> 01:14:01.959
Tell us what it is.

01:14:08.924 --> 01:14:10.759
"In exchange for a 40-million-won loan,

01:14:10.842 --> 01:14:14.263
Pyo Bak-ho will transfer 30% of his shares
of Pyo Merchant Marine."

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:18.850
"He also pledges to return the full amount
in cash by August 16, 1990."

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.895
"Written on August 16, 1989."

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.314
"Creditor Kang Jin-young."

01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:27.943
"Debtor Pyo Bak-ho."

01:14:32.614 --> 01:14:33.448
This is it.

01:14:34.741 --> 01:14:35.993
It's the promissory note.

01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:38.787
Is it the real thing?

01:14:39.413 --> 01:14:40.872
Yes, this is the one.

01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:45.586
I finally found the promissory note.

01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:47.963
CREDITOR: KANG JIN-YOUNG
DEBTOR: PYO BAK-HO

01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:50.048
PROMISSORY NOTE

01:14:53.468 --> 01:14:54.678
Mr. Koo.

01:14:55.554 --> 01:14:56.388
Goodness.

01:15:00.392 --> 01:15:01.226
Oh, dear.

01:15:05.147 --> 01:15:06.565
Gosh, Ms. Cha!

01:15:09.318 --> 01:15:11.153
We've come such a long way for this…

01:15:13.614 --> 01:15:15.657
when I've had it with me the whole time.

01:15:19.953 --> 01:15:21.955
-It's all good now.
-Oh, my goodness.

01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:27.044
We found it!

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:38.805
THE LAST MATCH

01:16:11.421 --> 01:16:14.341
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:16:14.424 --> 01:16:17.386
The business and the people
will all go back to their places!

01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:20.681
We'll all go back to our places!

01:16:20.764 --> 01:16:24.476
Please welcome Contestant 13, Wang Nam-mo!

01:16:24.559 --> 01:16:27.479
I will try my best without giving up.

01:16:27.562 --> 01:16:29.856
Wait a second.
What are you two up to? What was that?

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:33.568
Everyone in this world knows
except for you three here.

01:16:33.652 --> 01:16:35.195
I need you to do something.

01:16:35.278 --> 01:16:36.154
You crazy idiot.

01:16:36.655 --> 01:16:38.532
I also kicked out that punk,
Kang Tae-poong,

01:16:38.615 --> 01:16:40.200
and took over Typhoon Trading.

01:16:40.283 --> 01:16:42.160
Stop talking nonsense!

01:16:42.244 --> 01:16:47.207
I have never once given up
or abandoned this company.

01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:53.004
