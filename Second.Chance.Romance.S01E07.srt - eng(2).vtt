They always pull this stuff.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.060
Dad.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.900
Tomorrow, give Sun...

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.420
Wei.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.100
- Ting?
- Ting?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.580
Weren't you supposed to
come back tomorrow?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.860
I missed you so much.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.180
Worried you wouldn't
eat properly without me.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.380
You get so carried away with work.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.300
Now you're dragging Wei
into not eating either.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.900
Look at this girl.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.900
She actually came all the way
to my office

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.740
to keep an eye on me.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.380
Leave on time today.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.420
Can you make me fish head stew tonight?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.260
I want to have it.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.940
Of course.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460
I'll wrap things up and get off work.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.700
Okay.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.740
Then I'll go to the market

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.660
and get the biggest fish head for you.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.100
Okay.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.500
Wei,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.740
join us for dinner tonight.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.780
Yeah, Wei.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.940
I've got too much work.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.860
I can't make it.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.420
Alright.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.020
But remember to eat.

I'll see you in the next day or two.

Okay.

Wait for me.

Okay.

Let me get it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.900
Fish head... Hot!

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.860
Fish head and tofu soup.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.060
Here you go.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.500
Have some more.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.380
You made so much food.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.460
I'm gonna

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.060
gain a few pounds.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.260
You should eat more.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.220
Look how thin you are.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.100
Me gaining a bit of weight
isn't the issue.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.620
It's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.460
my dance partner I feel sorry for.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.460
He won't be able to lift me.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.780
Then he'd better work
on his strength training.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.220
That's his problem.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.020
So, how is it?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.380
Delicious.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.860
Come on, have some more.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.020
Ting,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.820
no more news

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.420
on the Queen Ballet thing?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.740
That was so long ago.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.660
You're still hung up on it?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.140
To be rejected for a reason like that?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.180
I can't accept it.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.140
It's okay, Dad.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.460
There are plenty of good dance troupes.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.620
Besides,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.580
I never really wanted to
go abroad anyway.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.220
I think my situation now is just fine.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.580
I'm closer to home.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.660
Whenever I crave your cooking,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900
I can just come back.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.540
The best place

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.500
for ballet is Europe.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.140
That's what Ms. Zhuang said

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.980
when you started learning ballet.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.060
Ting,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.500
never give up on your dreams.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.020
You should still

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.020
look for opportunities to try again.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.100
I didn't raise you

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.460
to keep you by my side forever.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.660
I raised you to become

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.500
the person you want to be.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.340
Don't worry, Dad.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.260
Eat up. It's not too hot now.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.060
Have some more.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.780
Okay. Thanks.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.340
No problem.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.020
Why did you come?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.740
What? Are you afraid of seeing me?

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.060
Is there something
you haven't said to me?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.940
What else is there left

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.500
to say between us?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.940
Fine then.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.900
We have nothing left to say.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.860
I'm leaving now.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.260
Tell Ms. Wen.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.300
Suit yourself.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.300
You're upset now?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.820
I'm not.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.580
What we had is in the past.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.580
It's over.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.300
Yeah.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.220
What did you expect?

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.220
Let's spread it out a bit more.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.340
Come on.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.180
What do you think?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.180
Is the back a bit too revealing?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.940
Not at all. It looks beautiful.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.140
It really does look nice.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.060
We'll have some new arrivals
in a few days.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.340
You're welcome to come back

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.860
and try them if you have time.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.220
Sure.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.180
So that's the story.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.700
I didn't expect her

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.980
to come back so suddenly.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.780
Wow, man.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.900
You've been carrying a torch
for over a decade.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.380
You're really hung up on her.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.980
You absolutely have to end up together,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.100
just like these two.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.900
But

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.140
you didn't even tell me
about something this big.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.540
You really don't treat me like a friend.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.740
Did you confess your feelings to her?

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.220
She doesn't see me that way.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.060
That's normal.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.300
Take Jiao, for example.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.900
She wasn't into me at first either.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.860
But

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.620
I was persistent. I never gave up.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.220
So

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.020
she married me right after college.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.540
So you need to confess now.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.300
I know,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.860
you're afraid

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.620
if you say it,
you two won't be friends anymore.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.860
I'm not trying to be harsh,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.660
but you're really bad at this stuff.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.300
You have to know,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.940
chasing girls requires a thick skin.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.100
Persistence pays off with women.
Go for it!

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.060
Alright.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.100
I'm done playing!

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.100
You're never any help.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.180
No, Wang Zeyuan.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.940
You really need to
listen to me this time.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.540
Let's see

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.580
what your preferred

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.220
wedding decoration styles are like.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.860
We have traditional
Chinese banquet style.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.780
And also Western garden style.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.500
And

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.060
you can choose

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.060
based on the style

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.580
of your attire.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.780
Which one is better,
Chinese or Western style?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.860
I'm not sure.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.060
Which do you like?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.540
I've actually been torn.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.820
Personally, I prefer Western style.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.940
I love the idea of walking

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.620
under a floral archway
in the wedding dress

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.180
with the blue sky and white clouds.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.820
But I also think

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.140
Rui's parents

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.340
and mine

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.380
might prefer

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.300
a more traditional banquet.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.780
Ms. Tan, what do you think?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.700
I actually think

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.380
whatever the two of you like
matters most.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.580
After all,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.340
it's the most important day
of your lives.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.140
Also, do you have

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.540
a preferred hotel?

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.300
We work with many hotels,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.220
but it's better
if you have a preference.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.420
Well, now look.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.380
The parents think

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.500
we're mistreating the students!

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.060
They don't even let them attend class!

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.860
You didn't sleep well, did you?

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.100
I'm sorry.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.220
Character determines destiny.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.620
That's just Ms. Guan's personality.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.260
And this is yours.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.580
There's no right or wrong.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.940
Don't feel pressured.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.500
Besides,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.980
the issue with Zheng Yufan

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.100
isn't your fault,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.540
nor is it Ms. Guan's.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.220
It lies with herself.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.100
I've been teaching students
my whole life.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.860
I know what children are thinking.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.740
Let her face it herself.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.620
Everyone has to face their own life.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.420
Should I not have come back?

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.820
I thought after all these years,
so many things

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.300
were in the past.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.660
But they're not.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.180
Ting,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.700
you've been my student
since you were seven.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.660
I watched you grow up.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.460
I'm very happy you're back.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.100
I believe in you.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.100
Don't rush to resolve

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.540
certain obsessions.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.780
You'll let them go gradually in time.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.540
Believe in yourself.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.540
I'm eating this.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.700
None for you.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.540
Le, you're here.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.420
We're back!

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.900
Great-grandpa!

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.780
Great-grandpa!

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.820
My boy.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.500
It's been so long
since you last visited me.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.300
Let me see if you've gained any weight.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.700
I haven't gained weight.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.020
Grandpa, you look a bit thinner.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.300
That's from missing you.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.860
You must be starving.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.020
Of course.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.380
Grandma said yesterday we were coming
to Great-grandpa's.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.100
So I didn't eat breakfast this morning.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.260
I came on an empty stomach.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.420
I thought Great-grandpa would
have lots of delicious food ready

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:53.900
for me.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.500
Absolutely.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.660
Dinner will be ready soon.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.620
All the good food is for you.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.180
Thank you, Great-grandpa.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.460
You won first place
in the model airplane competition?

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.500
I have a gift for you.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.260
Really?

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.260
Come here.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.700
It's so big.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.580
It's backwards.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:15.900
Thirsty?

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.340
Let me get you some water.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:17.820
Okay.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.660
Dad,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.780
Tan Siting is back.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.940
It seems she's not dancing anymore.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:24.940
She's teaching.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.260
Somehow,

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.500
she's at the same school as Yan now.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.860
They always run into each other.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.340
If she's back, fine then.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.180
So many years have passed.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.620
It probably won't amount to anything.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.860
I think she came back with an agenda.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.820
She keeps finding ways
to get close to Rui and Yan.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.300
She's even getting involved
in their wedding plans.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.340
With all this back and forth,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.140
who knows what might happen.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.220
Every time I see her,

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.500
I'm reminded of Haotian.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.660
I can't stand her

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.860
hovering around.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.180
And I don't think it's good for Le.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.220
They were young and reckless back then.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.900
Now they're adults.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.180
Let them handle their own affairs.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.740
I don't really

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.220
understand this.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.180
You don't have to. I do.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.580
Look how happy Le is.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.740
That's what matters.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.580
The black one goes with the gray one.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.580
Like this.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.740
Let me see.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.300
Such a thick book.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.740
Le,

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.820
text me when you get home.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.500
Next time you come,
I'll take you fishing.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.300
Bye.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:46.900
Bye, Grandpa.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.380
Bye.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.660
Is Tan Siting back?

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:58.980
Should I

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.380
pick up Le from school every day?

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.140
No need.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.020
Don't worry about it.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:10.900
Bye, Grandpa.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.660
[Cygne]

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.300
Hello, everyone.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.460
I'm the PR manager

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.860
responsible
for the Cygne brand promotion.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.420
For this meeting,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.460
let's first discuss
the specific promotion plan.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.340
The earliest written records about wine

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.460
actually date back
to Emperor Wu of Han's reign.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.140
According to Sima Qian's
"Records of the Grand Historian",

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.420
the envoy of the Han Dynasty,
Zhang Qian,

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.020
brought grape cultivation

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.420
and brewing techniques

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.340
from the Western Regions, located in
today's Hexi Corridor, Gansu region,

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.900
back to the Central Plains.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.740
So, wine at that time

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.460
was a delicacy

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.340
enjoyed by the imperial family
and high-ranking officials.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.140
You see,

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.020
the history of Chinese wine

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.620
is very long.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.180
Yes.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:01.700
Right.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.340
And our winery currently has

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.780
the top-tier brewing techniques
in the country.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.620
We have our own vineyard

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.260
in Hongyuan County, Sichuan.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.300
This year we have three

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.340
new varieties.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.660
Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir,

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.460
and Chardonnay.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.820
The bottle you have
is the Cabernet Sauvignon.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:20.700
Cabernet Sauvignon.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.380
How's it?

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.380
This Cabernet Sauvignon

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.420
has classic aromas

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.260
of ripe dark berries

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.420
and sweet spices.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.620
We aged it for sixteen months

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.740
in new 225-liter

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.580
French oak barrels.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.900
The mouthfeel is excellent.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.100
And the flavors are
very concentrated on the palate.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.780
Last year, this wine

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.380
received a high score of 96 points

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.500
from Robert Parker.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.340
Not bad.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.820
Look, it has a ruby-like color.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.580
Yes.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.740
It seems

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.020
we don't need to
focus solely on foreign wines anymore.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:52.700
Thank you.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740
Domestic wines

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.220
are no worse than theirs.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.540
Thank you.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.900
We've always aimed to produce wines

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.460
that suit the domestic palate.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.700
After all,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.140
our dietary habits

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.540
and cooking methods are quite different
from those abroad.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.220
So we've optimized the taste

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.940
based on different scenarios

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.740
where Chinese people enjoy wine.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.140
We hope

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.180
our wines

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.580
will soon gain
international recognition.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.300
Absolutely.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:18.820
Yes, definitely.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.380
With a brand like this,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.020
our brand promotion

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.940
will be much easier.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.700
The quality speaks for itself.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.540
I believe Mr. Zhao now

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.940
has more ideas
for shooting this documentary.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.980
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.180
I have

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.300
a deeper understanding of wine now.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.700
Yes.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.380
I look forward to seeing your work soon.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.060
Hope it lives up to your expectations.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:37.980
By the way, Mr. Feng,

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.780
what is Cygne's flagship product?

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.700
The flagship product?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.060
That would undoubtedly be

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.660
our Cygne 2017.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.060
The grapes that year

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.380
were exceptionally

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:52.900
high quality

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.780
due to

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.860
the unique terroir.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.580
Its origin...

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.060
It's from the same region.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.460
Isn't the altitude there very high?

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.300
Over 3,000 meters.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.060
Because of that,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.460
it gets ample sunlight and UV exposure,

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.300
and there's a significant
diurnal temperature variation.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.660
Grapes grown in such an environment

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.060
are exceptionally high quality.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.100
I am more confident in it now.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.860
May our wine sell like hotcakes!

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:16.980
- Sell like hotcakes!
- Sell like hotcakes!

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.380
Thank you.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.020
Cheers, everyone.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.980
Thanks for all your brainstorming.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.340
No problem.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.300
When will the proposal be ready?

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.060
Soon.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.540
Thank you.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.860
Why are you so stubborn?

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.300
I've said I don't want to!
I don't like it!

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.660
Can you stop pushing me?

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.420
How am I pushing you?

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.900
I only want what's best for you.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.340
That's all you ever say.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.580
Ms. Tan.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.340
Yufan.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.420
Hello, Madam.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.980
Another teacher?

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.300
What are you...?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.860
Mom, don't talk to Ms. Tan like that.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:49.780
It's alright.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.820
I came to see how Yufan's foot

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.060
is doing.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.900
Come on in.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.460
Come in.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.540
Ms. Tan,

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.220
please have a seat.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.860
Thank you.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.060
Let me get you some water.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:05.740
Thank you.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.100
Ms. Guan yesterday, and Ms. Tan today.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.820
Tag-teaming to fight me for my daughter?

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.820
Madam,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.420
I just wanted to

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.260
check on Yufan's foot.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.780
There's no need for you

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.300
to worry about that.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:23.780
Ms. Tan.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.260
Thank you.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.340
We won't be participating
in that competition anymore.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.900
And we won't be attending classes

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.940
anymore either.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.500
Yufan,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.140
you don't want to go back to school?

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.940
I do want to go.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.580
How was your trip to Australia?

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.260
Couldn't get used to the climate there.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.340
It's better here.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.260
Warm in winter, and cool in summer.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.180
Purely a vacation?

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.180
Of course

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.180
I also

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.580
went to check out the wine scene.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.460
Gained quite a lot of insight, actually.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:33:59.820
There's

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.820
a large plantation in a suburb

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.860
about several dozen kilometers
from Melbourne.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.700
Right next to it
are the winery and cellars.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.300
They still use
ancient brewing techniques,

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.860
but the wine they produce

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.100
has a very unique taste.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.660
I brought some back.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.900
You can try it later.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.900
This year I'm also
considering introducing

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.420
some new wine varieties

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.220
to meet domestic market demands.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.340
Ms. Gao,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.340
I think

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.700
it's time for Tianlu to start
producing and selling its own wine.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.700
I think this winery

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.820
is a good opportunity.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.380
If we successfully acquire
the Australian winery...

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.060
Jin,

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.860
I trust your judgment.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.260
Forgive my bluntness,

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.700
but how much do you earn in a month?

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.420
I've heard about you from Fan before.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.220
She said you're

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.300
the first Chinese principal dancer
in a French ballet troupe.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.340
Then you must be quite accomplished

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.420
in your field.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.340
I don't know if you have

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.180
any side jobs or anything.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.820
Combining everything,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.060
what's your annual salary?

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.540
Let's be frank.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.980
Actually, I haven't wanted Fan

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.500
to continue with ballet
for a long time now.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.220
First, because she

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.860
gets injured endlessly.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.980
It pains me to see it.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.100
Second, because

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.180
it's really not a promising career.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.100
I don't mean anything else by it.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.660
I'm just using you as an example.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.460
Look at you.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.580
You're so capable and talented.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.540
Yet you retired so young.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.540
Once you step off that stage,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.260
the audience forgets you quickly.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.660
Even if Fan makes it internationally

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.300
like you did,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.500
and becomes a principal dancer,

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.380
how long can she actually dance?

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.060
Eight, ten years?

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.540
I really can't bear

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.740
to let her rely
on such a short-lived career.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.780
Madam,

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.460
I understand

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:11.780
how you feel.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:12.740
True.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.140
Ballet is very demanding,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.140
and the career span is relatively short.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.980
But if you

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.140
get the chance to perform

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.380
on the world's biggest stages,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.460
the sense of achievement and happiness

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.300
is something you never forget.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.500
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.060
I don't have such high aspirations.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.340
You talk about feelings and sensations,

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.740
but I just don't get it.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.540
Our initial idea was very simple.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.100
We just sent her to learn dancing.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.340
We thought a girl

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.860
learning dance would have
a good figure and poise.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.900
Just doing it as a hobby was fine.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.420
We didn't expect her
to become so obsessed with it.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.140
In the early years,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:52.860
it was fine.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.780
Her dad and I could do our utmost

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.620
to nurture

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.260
and support her.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.020
But now we can't.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.180
She's older.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.180
She needs to think about her future.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:03.940
So we've decided to

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.140
have her switch to acting.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.540
Mom,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.660
I told you I don't like it!

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.820
What do you mean?

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.660
What people seek in life

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.740
is a job that provides a living.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.020
You know ballet is a dead end,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.260
yet you still insist
on going down that path?

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.420
I just don't want you

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.180
to waste your best years

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.300
entirely on ballet

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.500
and find yourself with nothing

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.700
when you're older!

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.900
What will you do then?

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.820
You can only rely on marriage
to change your fate.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.300
So why can't we find a job

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300
early on

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.260
that allows us to live a better life?

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.500
I don't care about any of that.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.620
You're still young.
You don't understand.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.420
If you stubbornly stick to this path,

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.540
when you reach my age

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.180
and think back
on what I'm telling you today,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.140
you'll regret it, and it'll be too late!

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.300
Anyway, I won't go learn acting,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.220
film any shows,

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.380
or attend any acting classes!

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.100
That won't do.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.620
If you're going into acting,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.100
you absolutely need a

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.980
a professional teacher
to guide you in the beginning.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.660
Don't worry.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.220
I'll hire a good tutor for you.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.900
This time we'll get a female teacher.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:02.780
Mom!

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.940
Stop talking back!

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.620
Your dad and I
have already decided this!

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.220
This is non-negotiable!

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.220
I'm not going to any acting class!

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.420
Why are you so stubborn?

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.180
Have you been brainwashed?

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.380
I'm her mom.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.540
I'm the one in this world

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.260
who most wants her to be happy.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.420
You are not responsible for her life.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.300
So please

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.580
don't use your own dreams to dictate

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.580
her life.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.380
Qu Zhen?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.260
I'll tell you a secret.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.140
Ms. Tan hasn't been
in a good mood lately.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.700
What happened?

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:14.940
Tell me about it.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:18.940
Shuhan.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.420
Bao, are you heading out?

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.340
I made some food. Want to eat together?

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.220
I won't join you guys today.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.980
I really envy Yuan

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.900
for having
such a caring sister like you.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.020
Not like me.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.660
I have to worry
about a whole big family.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.860
I need to go home and cook now.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.980
You're so sweet. You envy me?

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.140
I envy you.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.940
You got married

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.980
and had kids so young.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:38.860
Him?

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.780
No signs of progress at all.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.220
Don't worry.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.340
I think there's hope this time.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:46.940
Is he seeing someone?

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.740
Yes. I heard his first love

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.060
recently returned to the country.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.500
He didn't even tell me

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.460
until I asked him.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.740
Seriously.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.740
If he had told me earlier,

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.260
I might have helped him
solve it long ago.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.180
Shuhan,

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.660
did you know about this person?

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.540
No way.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.020
He didn't even tell you?

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.140
But I think
he's really serious this time.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.820
He even sponsored a large sum of money

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.140
to that ballet school.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.540
I'm running late now.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.340
I have to go.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.460
Alright, go on.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.380
Let's catch up next time.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:17.860
Bye.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.100
Mr. Feng,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.940
you've won a gold medal

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.780
at the French wine competition.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.820
This is truly remarkable

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.060
for our domestic brand.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:29.620
You flatter me.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:31.980
I feel

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.820
that ballet and wine are very close

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:35.900
in their spiritual core.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.140
I hope to pair wine with ballet

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.100
in the documentary.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.100
Using ballet as a metaphor for wine?

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.180
That's novel.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:49.660
Yes.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.380
When he told me this idea,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.460
I thought it was excellent.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.260
Riding on the momentum of this award,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.860
plus our documentary,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:57.860
I believe

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.780
it's a great promotional opportunity

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.940
for the Cygne brand

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.900
to sell well both domestically
and internationally.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.060
Yes.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.300
So how do you plan to present it?

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.660
Actually,

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.180
we want to make

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.540
the high-cultural image of wine

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.340
more accessible.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.620
Recently, a PR company approached me.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.620
They want to film a documentary

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.340
about ballet at our school,

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.220
hoping to let more people
understand ballet.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.180
That's a good thing.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.820
Madam,

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.580
what do you need me to do?

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.340
They want me to recommend a teacher

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.300
to participate in the filming
of their documentary.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.620
I'd like to recommend you.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.900
Ballet

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.860
has always been seen

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.460
as a very painful art form.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.140
People think it requires

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.620
enduring pain and sacrifice
beyond what ordinary people

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.980
can bear

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.700
to persevere.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.540
But no one has ever truly understood

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.100
the powerful inner strength

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:58.780
that ballet

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.340
can bring people.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.420
I think you're the most suitable person.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.700
This is also the reason

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.980
you have never given up
on ballet all these years.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.060
Right?

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.660
Changing the public's
fixed perception of ballet

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.980
and letting more people
fall in love with it

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.020
were my original intentions
for founding this school.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:22.820
Ting,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.100
I know

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.820
you didn't want to be
in the public eye after retiring.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.260
It's okay.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.580
I understand.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.180
If you don't want to participate,
just tell me.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.020
Madam,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.860
I'll do it.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.780
Indeed.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.100
If we want more people to understand

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.860
and recognize ballet,

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.820
we need the power of media platforms.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.540
Just tell me what you need me to do.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:48.980
Great.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.300
Thank you, Ting.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.980
It's what I should do.
