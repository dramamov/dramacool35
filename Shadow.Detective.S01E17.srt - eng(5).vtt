Lu Jialei should have been dead long ago.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.190
Every minute she's still alive

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.230
is a reminder of my past mistakes

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.090
and a stain on my record.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.470
It isn't our goal to kill her.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.650
She's still useful to us.

[Episode 17]

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.030
This is the right bottle,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.710
but the pills inside are wrong.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.750
I've seen this kind of pill before.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.190
It shouldn't be like this.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.910
This...

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.430
This looks more like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.190
a psychotropic drug.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.380
If I remember correctly,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160
the first time I saw such pills

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.090
was during a visit
to a psychiatric hospital.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.630
Seriously?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.630
This medicine

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.560
has a sedative effect on patients,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.240
but can cause headaches
and frequent dreaming

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.800
in healthy individuals with long-term use,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
or even more serious consequences.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.280
I'll take this bottle of pills back
for some tests.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.800
I might be mistaken.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.650
Or perhaps this medicine
has other effects.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.800
Anyway,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.630
before I reach a conclusion,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.280
you must not take it anymore.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.950
You're awake, Dr. Gu.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.590
Lu,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.480
what brings you here?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.100
Let me help you.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.440
Thank you.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.630
I must have fallen asleep.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.770
How come you have time to visit me?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.400
I've been wanting to come visit you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.130
and see how you're recovering.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.710
I know you're always busy working.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm fine, really.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.870
The nurse said

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.870
I'd get well after some rest.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.310
I'm sorry to have

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.090
caused you trouble this time.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.290
Actually, I didn't help with much.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
You've given me a lot of help.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.910
The sleeping pills you prescribed for me

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.240
have helped me sleep much better at night.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.910
Really?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.590
Glad to hear that.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.030
Only when you're well rested

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.310
can you have the energy
to investigate cases.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.560
However...

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.290
I often have nightmares.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.840
Nightmares?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.400
I'm wondering

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.730
if there's a side effect of this medicine.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.560
The ingredients are mostly plant-based,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.290
such as spiny jujube seeds
and arborvitae seeds.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.910
This medicine is quite mild.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.000
Could someone have changed your pills?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.070
Changed my pills?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.580
Could that have happened?

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.790
It's a real possibility.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.000
Nowadays, bad people

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.190
can come up with all sorts of evil plans.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.720
If that has truly happened,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.630
it means you're in danger now.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.960
Have you told Inspector Guan about it yet?

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.240
No.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.210
Look into it.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.120
You must look into it.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.190
I fear that someone may harm you.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.040
Don't worry about me.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.190
I'll stay alert.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.790
Just focus on your recovery.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.560
You have to be extra cautious.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.190
Dr. Gu, it's time to change your dressing.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.230
Have a good rest.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.530
I'll visit you again in a few days.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.600
You're busy all the time.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.270
Just focus on your work.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.390
I'll be fine here.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.310
I'll get going then.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.430
Okay. Take care.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.630
Lu Yizhen,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.520
why do you pretend not to hear me

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.880
every time I talk to you?

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.550
I'm talking to you now.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.750
When will you be back?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.860
Who are you talking to?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.750
You're back.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.560
I looked into that medicine for you.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.830
What did you find?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.510
Just as I said,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.640
it's not a sedative.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.040
A doctor I'm acquainted with,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.100
after hearing about your condition,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.900
told me

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.330
that it was fine to take sedatives,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.950
but long-term dependence on medication
was not advisable,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.680
and that you needed to relax

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.300
and find relief from stress.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.870
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.240
I am.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.610
I am listening.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.630
So?

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.160
Did you tell Dr. Gu about it?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.950
Yes, I did.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.570
But not in so many words.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.150
He seemed to have no idea about it at all.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.270
And it was he who suggested
that someone might have

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.360
changed my pills.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.110
Actually,
I've also thought of that possibility.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.870
After all, he and his colleagues

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.990
are surely able
to tell different pills apart.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.990
They couldn't have mistaken yours.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.480
But I really can't think of anyone

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.940
who could change my pills.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.690
Alright. Just drop it.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.720
Look at that deep frown on your face.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.460
For your own safety,

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.040
from now on, don't take any medicine

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.630
that hasn't been checked by me.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.380
Do you hear me?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.909
Yes, I do,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.440
Dr. Si.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.310
So this is where we stand now.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.270
Split up and get to work, guys.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.930
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.920
Dong, brief her.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.600
Okay.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.159
An antique shop on Guangdong Road
was robbed.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.950
Two shop assistants were severely slashed.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.410
All the antiques in the shop
were taken away.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.480
Have you discussed

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.000
the Zhuo family's case with Director Huo?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.090
That case is not to be rushed.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.040
We'll deal with this robbery first.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.170

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.850
How unfortunate.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.020
The shop got robbed
at this particular time.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.560
What do you mean?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.920
I had just got a new shipment
of precious items in,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.680
including imperial porcelain
from the Qianlong Period

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.610
and some calligraphy and painting works
of Tang Yin.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.470
How much is the overall loss?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.640
Well...

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.320
The exact figure is yet to be determined.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.850
I've taken out a bank loan.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
How am I supposed to survive this?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.950
How many robbers were there?

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.720
Four.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.550
Four robbers.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.560
Did you catch a look at their faces?

Guan Cen.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.920
The interview's done.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920
What did you find?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.360
The shop owner is named Wu Chang.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.870
During my conversation with him,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.830
he complained about being robbed
at this particular time.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.560
It seems this robbery
has really struck him hard.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.850
Inspector.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.950
The witness stated

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.540
that there were four robbers,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.740
who showed up with their faces covered.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.920
During the robbery,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.190
one person waited in the car,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.680
while the others ransacked the shop.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.809
One of them had a gun.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They had well-defined roles.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.789
These should be habitual offenders.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.000
Check the list
of newly released ex-convicts.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.240
See if anyone matches the profile.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.640
Got it.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.549
Two shop assistants were injured.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.630
One sank into a coma,
and the other was slashed.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.150
The robbery lasted for a very short time.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.550
The robber holding the gun didn't fire it.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.480
No firing at all?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.440
They were probably
avoiding drawing attention.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440
After all, the robbery

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.810
ended in just a few minutes.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.120
They chose to rob in the morning

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.440
and managed to escape.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.330
It was a premeditated robbery.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.240
Tell our men to preserve the crime scene.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.670
Got it.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.240
In addition,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.630
a passerby said one of the suspects

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.910
dropped something when their car

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.600
was taking a turn.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.080
When he tried to pick it up,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.180
his leg got injured.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.980
That suspect is of medium build.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.510
It's been quite a while.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.060
There's a slim chance
of tracing their escape route.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.200
Have our men set up a checkpoint
at each intersection.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.320
All suspicious vehicles

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.600
must be detained immediately.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.000
Got it.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.280
Come with me.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.350
Where are we heading?

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.840
Miss, sir,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.300
come on, have a try.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.980
Fresh Longjing tea.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.870
How did he figure out our genders?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.240
I don't drink Longjing tea.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.640
I only enjoy Maojian tea.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.220
I have Guzhang Maojian tea leaves.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.100
And Baima Maojian tea leaves.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.400
Which do you prefer, sir?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.360
You're a real expert, sir.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.400
I must provide you
with the finest tea leaves.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.910
Do you know the incident this morning?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.750
Yes, I do.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.240
Word about it had already got out,

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.840
about half a month ago.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.440
Who did it?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.440
Brute Zhang.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.240
Isn't he in prison?

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.050
Not any more.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.150
He was released not long ago.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.150
Who else was involved?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.510
Liao Yongjie and Ali.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.040
They used to work for him.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.870
To track down the stolen goods,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.440
go talk to Mr. Hong.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.670
He's the go-to guy
for fencing stolen property now.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.390
Mr. Hong?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.910
Are you saying if they are to
dispose of the stolen goods,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.710
they'll have to turn to Mr. Hong?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.910
If you want, I can help schedule a meeting

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.040
for you and Mr. Hong.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.630
However...

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.320
No need.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.280
We'll work it out on our own.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:27.480
Let's go.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.160
Who is that man we just talked to?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.390
He has ties
to both the legal and criminal worlds,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.200
with access to much information.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.320
He used to make quite a lot of money

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.700
by selling information.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.240
As a result, he made many enemies,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.700
some of which blinded him.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.440
After that,

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.500
he disappeared from the underworld.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.900
But in fact, he's still secretly doing

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.760
this business in a different way.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.350
All his information
comes from reliable sources,

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.810
so he charges high prices.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.400
What about Brute Zhang?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.990
I guess he is the leader
of this gang of robbers

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.640
and likely the one who stayed in the car.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.670
He's a habitual offender

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.720
specialized in robbery.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.180
I heard about him long ago.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.910
He was put in jail last time
exactly for robbery.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.000
Unexpectedly, he treaded the same old path
right after he was released.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.600
Those who used to work for him

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.920
must've assisted him in this robbery.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.860
But I hadn't heard of their names
until just now.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.440
What about Mr. Hong?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.320
Mr. Hong...

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.080
It's fair to say he's the most powerful
man in the black market.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.630
He's a smuggler, trafficking

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.080
things as trivial as daily necessities

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.200
and as valuable as gold.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.150
He engages himself in any kind

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.550
of profitable business.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.860
The thing is...

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.810
What?

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.150
Given Mr. Hong's complicated background,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.750
we'd better not alert him now.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.550
Let's go find Brute Zhang first.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.550
Hold on.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.830
Any findings?

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.590
No.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.320
Keep searching.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.750
Yes.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.780
The current leads

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.020
have pointed to four suspects.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.810
[Maintain Law and Discipline]

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.500
They are Brute Zhang, Liao Yongjie,
Lin Weihao

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.120
and Ali.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.960
Brute Zhang, aged 32,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.360
committed several famous robberies
in Shanghai.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.630
He was released from prison
just last month.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.960
He's very good at casing target locations

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960
and devising plans.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.720
Since he treats his men
with great generosity,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.850
many people would gladly work for him.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.750
Liao Yongjie, aged 26,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.750
used to be a devoted follower
of Brute Zhang.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.480
After the latter was put in jail,
he never had a proper job.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.720
Last year, he got married.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.320
It's said that he's running
a small business now.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.850
Lin Weihao
has excellent martial arts skills.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.660
He grew up with Brute Zhang

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.030
and waited for the latter's release
from prison

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.510
instead of finding another boss.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.110
As for Ali,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.270
he has worked for other people
than Brute Zhang.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.280
This is a ruthless man

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.300
who craves nothing but money.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.160
He was probably just helping out
with this robbery.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.320
Their car broke down,

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.870
and one of them got injured.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.480
Checkpoints have been set up
at all the docks.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.840
They couldn't have vanished into thin air.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.570
They must still be in Shanghai.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.150
The shop owner said

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.600
all the new antiques had been taken away.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.030
With so many items on them,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.330
these robbers won't choose the main docks.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.020
So, we need to focus on canvassing

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.630
the smaller ones and the illegal ones.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.840
Our people are on it now,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.320
but there won't be results until later,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.840
given the large number of docks.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.600
Have the stolen antiques

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.870
appeared on the black market?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.510
No.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.240
But everyone in the antique business

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.870
is having their eyes on these items.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.910
Any word from our informants?

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.510
No.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.980
I've spread the information,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.580
but...

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.380
Inspector!

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.020
Inspector.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.770
A suspect just showed up alone
on the Northern Street.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.300
Let's go!

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.120
Yes!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.760
You go there with them.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.240
Got it.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.360
And you go there with them.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:09.750
Okay.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.800
Let's go.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.650
You go that way.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.320
How did it go with your search?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.150
Did you find him?

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.720
No.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.750
Me neither.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.350
Let's keep looking.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.480
I'll go that way.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.620
You two, head over there.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.450
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.270
Sir.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.360
Hello. What medicine do you need?

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.330
I'm Lu Yizhen from the Police Station.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.630
Officer,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.720
this business I'm running
is legitimate and clean.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.600
I've done nothing wrong.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.080
Did a man with an injured leg

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.240
come in for medicine?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.840
That man's leg was severely injured,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.030
and he lost a lot of blood.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.120
It looked horrific.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.840
I told him at that time

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.840
that he couldn't receive

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.440
proper treatment in my shop.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.360
I suggested him go to the hospital.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.200
But he refused.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.240
Then he just bought some

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.510
gauze and hemostatic medicine,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.550
bandaged himself, and left.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.120
Do you know where he was off to?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.150
When did he leave?

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.080
Just a few minutes ago.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.790
See, I'm still cleaning up his blood.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.150
But I didn't notice where he went,

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.080
since I was busy handling the mess.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.150
I just recalled something.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.550
He said he was going to take the tram.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.350
Yes, the tram.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.030
-That's right.
-Where's the tram station?

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.550
Go out and turn right.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.150
Thank you!

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.240
Lu Yizhen!

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.270
The tram!

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.150
Hold on!

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.250
Back off!

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.480
Stop there, Liao Yongjie.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.349
Let go of me!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.060
Put your guns down!

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.349
You put your knife down.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.440
Calm down now.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.240
Calm down?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.240
Heck no!

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.220
Put your guns down!

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.020
Otherwise...

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.110
Stay there!

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.240
Step back!

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.280
Liao Yongjie.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.240
Liao Yongjie!

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.750
Move!

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.730
Keep moving!

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.640
Freeze!

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.410
Back off, all of you!

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.540
Or I'll kill her!

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.310
Back off!

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.920
Brute Zhang
isn't worthy of your protection.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.770
Put your knife down!

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.050
I won't betray my boss!

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.440
Stay away! Back off!

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.530
Back off!

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.780
So you'll betray your family instead?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.960
Your wife is waiting for you at home.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.200
What would she think
if she saw you like this?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.290
Leave my wife out of this!

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.370
She's innocent!

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.070
Fine.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.430
I won't talk about your wife.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.680
But how about your unborn child?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.110
These are the names
you've come up with for your baby, right?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.890
"Liao Baokang."

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.810
"Liao Xiangjiao."

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.790
You've put a lot of thought
into naming your baby.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.920
Don't you want to see it come to the world

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.450
and watch him or her grow up?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.400
Brute Zhang won't be with you forever,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.710
but your family will.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.270
Now, you're deserting them

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.730
for what you call loyalty.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.720
How are your wife and children

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.450
supposed to live in this world?

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.030
But...

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.750
B-But I've hit the point of no return.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.740
-Move!
-Let's go.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.060
Check on that area.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.480
Are you okay?

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.160
I'm fine.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.800
Thank you.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.660
No problem.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.250
Go home now.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.120
Confess.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.310
I can't.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.310
If I tell the truth,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.590
my boss will kill me.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.960
You have to come clean

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960
in exchange for a reduced sentence.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.550
Be cooperative, and I guarantee

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.210
you'll see your family again.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.840
You promise?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.810
I'll come clean.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.310
I was planning to quit
this line of business

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.390
after that one last robbery.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.030
For your wife and your unborn child?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.440
Yes.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.680
Now, for their sake,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.520
tell me everything you know.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.310
My boss said

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.310
we could

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.240
make a big fortune this time.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.070
So...

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.110
I got onboard.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.110
Little did I know

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.880
the car would break down halfway,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.310
and even less did I imagine

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.070
my leg would be injured so badly.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.530
I told them to go without me.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.880
Later on,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.400
we're supposed to meet up

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.500
at a wasteland near Jiuxing Village.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.440
Will you fence the goods yourselves?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:10.880
No.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.440
There's already a buyer for them.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.720
Soon,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.440
we'll head for a place

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.440
where someone will be waiting for us.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.370
What place is it?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.210
I don't know.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.000
Only the boss knows the location.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.750
How many guns do you guys have?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.200
Only one, in Ali's hands.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.440
I don't know how he got hold of it.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.280
Take him away.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.110
Move!

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.350
The robbers will make a transaction
at a wasteland

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.480
near Jiuxing Village.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.010
Let's go.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.820
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.590
Dong.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.900
Inspector,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.980
their trails end here.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.250
It's going to rain heavily.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.350
We must track the gang down

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.610
before the storm hits.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.520
Lead a team to search over there.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:14.880
Okay.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.370
Guys, follow me!

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.510
You go back to the Police Station

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.710
and ask Du Linfeng for reinforcements.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200
Hold on.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.830
This is an order. Don't you understand?

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.350
We're not sure
how many people we're against.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.480
Even if you find them,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480
you won't be able to do much,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.810
since you're all alone.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.240
But if the two of us go together,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.880
there might be a chance of arresting them.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.340
Besides, I've left a message
for Du Linfeng.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.470
What am I supposed to tell

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.310
your parents if you get injured?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.980
I'm here to investigate a case,

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.780
not to seek protection from you.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.590
Be seated and wait a moment.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.590
I'll be right back.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.720
Where are you going?

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.590
It's pouring rain now.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.750
Do you think they can meet their contact?

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.480
To avoid compromising the antiques' value,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480
they'll probably take shelter too.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.950
That means
we still stand a chance of catching them.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.610
We'll go look for them again
when the rain stops.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.890
I won't let you take risks with me.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.480
Aren't you happy to have me,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.810
a helpful aide, around?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.400
I hate to see you get hurt,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.470
and I hate it even more
if you get hurt because of me.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.950
After Ge Yunchen's case,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.600
I did much serious thinking.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.720
I'm sorry.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.920
I'm not that fragile.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.720
Just think about it—
back in the police academy,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.580
I was always one of the top cadets.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.090
Maybe I'll become your superior one day.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.750
You?

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.120
What? Don't you believe it?

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.550
I do.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.920
Let the bygones be bygones, Guan Cen.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.100
You're different
from what you were like back then.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.120
I don't want you to be
overly worried about

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.030
and protective of me like my parents are,

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.690
just because of what happened

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.510
years ago.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.070
We should live a normal life.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.830
So should you.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.260
I'm protecting you...

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.990
not just because of my past mistakes.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.880
Now, you are

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.770
a very special person to me.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.090
We are two of a kind.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.290
That's why
I've chosen to stand by your side.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:45.880
Lu Yizhen.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.070
The rain has stopped.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.900
Dong must be looking for us out there.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.560
Let's go out to look for clues.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.440
What should we do now?

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.790
We took all these items

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.440
directly from the antique shop.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.510
Who would believe it if we said

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.840
we didn't replace them?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.160
Who would've known
Wu Chang would be so bold

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.690
as to give us counterfeits?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.510
There's no way out.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.400
Why not take these fake antiques with us

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.070
and run?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.440
Maybe we can still make some money
out of them.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.000
No.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.510
You know
what those Japanese are capable of.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.770
You think we can escape from their grasp?

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.350
Mr. Zhuo is dead now.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.810
Sasaki Jiro has lost his main backer.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.790
Can he still be as arrogant as before?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.040
Let's run.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.750
We must flee if we are to survive.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.470
No, we must confess if we are to survive.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.770
Don't even think about running away
with these things.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.300
Do you really take yourself
as a watchdog now?

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.680
What's that nonsense?

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.070
If Boss hadn't taken you in,

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.730
you wouldn't have fared
better than a stray dog!

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.640
You...

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.700
We're police officers. Freeze!
