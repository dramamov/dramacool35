[Episode 10]

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.180
Miss Liu

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.940
will shortly become my concubine.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.540
Rumeng,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.140
come here.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.860
Both of you offer your stepmother
some tea.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Dad!

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.860
She's a wretch.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.020
If she marries into the Wang family,
I will be the first to object.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.820
How dare you!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.620
You...

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.300
Wan'er,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.820
I don't blame you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.820
for being unable to accept it now.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.140
Anyway,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.340
we will soon be one family.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.420
You come back here.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.140
You insolent brat.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.860
Um...

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.820
Mr. Wang,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.940
let me

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.220
offer this tea.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.580
Since it is Miss Liu's own wish,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.580
I offer this tea

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.380
to you, Madam.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.420
Madam,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.340
when we met at The Paramount,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.820
you told me

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.540
you drifted through life,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.980
struggling to survive,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.380
and sought someone to rely on.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.020
You've gotten this far
in just a few months.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.740
Tell me,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.580
should I offer my congratulations?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.620
Of course, you should.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Marrying Mr. Wang is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.780
my heartfelt wish.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.220
With this cup of tea,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.980
I wish Marshal Chen and Miss Wang

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.220
a lifetime of happiness.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.220
Good.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.220
Good.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.420
Rumeng.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.780
Well, this matter

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.340
is settled.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.100
In a couple of days,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.860
we will hold the weddings together.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.420
Why don't you go back
to The Paramount now

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.940
and pack your things?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.380
Move in today. How about that?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.940
Okay.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.460
Come, I will show you to your room.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.420
Let's go.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.260
Mr. Wang.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.100
My father will be returning
to Song City shortly.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.740
The Marshal's residence is
undergoing renovations.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.420
May I stay at your residence
for a few days?

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.700
Consider it...

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.340
An opportunity to spend more time
with Wan'er.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.140
No problem at all.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.820
We'd be delighted.

[Dock Transfer Contract]
This dowry from Liu Rumeng

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.780
arrives at a most opportune time.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.740
From now on,
all shipments will use this dock.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.420
Understood.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.100
Also...

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.420
Keep a close watch on Liu Rumeng for me.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.620
And on Chen Wenbin.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.100
Is that clear?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.100
Yes, sir.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.020
Last time, if I hadn't
secretly switched the goods,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.180
I might have been caught red-handed

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.740
by my dear future son-in-law.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.940
Is there anything else?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.580
No, sir.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.220
Wenbin,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.980
are you truly here for a woman,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.420
or do you know about my opium trade?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.420
Since you dare to move into my house,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.820
don't blame me for uncovering the truth.

[Memory of Lin Wenruo, Lin Qingyi]

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.140
Rumeng,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.100
kneel before your parents.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.140
Why did you take it upon yourself

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.780
to marry Wang Penghui?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.220
Do you still remember the promises
you made to me?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.660
I remember.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.180
Never touch opium.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.260
Never act alone.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.540
Never risk my life.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.900
Hua, you have to believe me.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.700
Marrying Wang Penghui is just a facade.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.540
He was already starting to suspect me.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.540
If I don't marry into the Wang family,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.820
I can never get my revenge.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.140
Rumeng, you're still lying to me,
aren't you?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.420
Is this because of Chen Wenbin?

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.540
I recognized him.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.780
He's Su Jinmo from the orphanage.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.820
We only had each other growing up.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.060
I didn't tell him then,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.540
and I won't tell him now.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.740
I understand
you don't want him involved.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.100
But do you really think

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.540
this will stop Chen Wenbin?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620
The vengeance belongs to the Lin family.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.980
It has nothing to do with him.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.700
Marrying into the Wang family

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.740
is a dangerous move,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.820
but it will prove useful.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.260
Concubine Liu,

you're still willing to walk on it?

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.380
Aren't you afraid

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.380
these shards might cut your feet?

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.060
Obstacles in my path.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.700
I just crush them and kick them aside.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.420
Since I stepped through
the Wang residence's door,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.660
I've never been afraid of bleeding.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.220
It's you, Miss Wang,
whom I'm concerned about.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.060
From now on,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.980
you must learn to properly respect me.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.300
- You...
- Stop!

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.100
Wang Wan'er,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.180
the Chen family values decorum
above all.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.060
Wilful rudeness

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.380
and disrespect toward one's...

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.220
elders

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.620

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.660
I'm your mother-in-law.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.460
Qingmao?

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.780
Impossible.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.860
Impossible! Impossible!

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.220
You're dead!

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.500
You can't be here!

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.180
You can't be!

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.380
Wan'er,

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.380
my dear "friend."

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.620
Why did you help your father

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.780
frame our family for opium trafficking?

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.100
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.100
A huge fire

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.860
killed thirteen members of my family.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.900
Why?

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.620
It wasn't me!

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.020
And you threw me into the sea!

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.980
It wasn't me!

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.860
Why?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.860
Because your Lin family was stupid!

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.620
So what if
we used your Lin family's accounts

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.980
to smuggle opium?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.100
My Dad said he'd pay you!

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.540
You were the ones who refused!

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.820
You even had to go to the police!

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.780
If you didn't die,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.620
did you expect me and my Dad
to die instead?

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.740
And you!

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.860
Lin Qingyi!

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.060
Why were you the beloved,
pampered young miss,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.220
while I was

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.860
the study maid,
even my own father despised?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.460
I hate you! I hate you!

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.420
The day of the Lin family fire,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.860
I was the one who splashed the oil
on your face!

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.860
I wanted to watch you

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.220
become an ugly freak

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.380
that everyone would reject!

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.660
Wang Wan'er! Wang Penghui!

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.580
I won't let you die so easily.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.980
I will make you

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.340
confess the truth with your own mouths!

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.740
Qingmao,

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.420
I searched for you for seven years,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.660
never knowing

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.020
you were carrying such a bloody,
deep-seated hatred.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.820
In the past, I failed to keep

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.220
our promise from the orphanage.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.100
Today,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.220
let me stay in the Wang family

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.500
and get revenge for you.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.100
What are you causing a scene about
in the middle of the night...

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.940
Help her up.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.820
Miss Wang, wake up!

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.860
What are you shouting for?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.900
Look at the state you're in!

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.180
Dad! Dad!

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.260
I saw Qingmao!

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.420
Qingmao came for me!

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.860
- Qingmao came for me!
- Nonsense!

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.340
No, Dad!

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.780
She really came for me!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.020
Get a grip!

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.460
Dad...

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.140
Dad! She came for me!

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.580
Qingmao came for me!

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.700
Qingmao came for me!

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.780
Get back to bed and go to sleep!

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.620
Qingmao came for me!

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.780
Qingmao came for me!

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.020
The timing is rather convenient.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.580
How is it that Qingmao appears now,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.820
only after Liu Rumeng has moved in?
