00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.200
Heaven rewards those who persevere.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.400
After all these years,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.200
you've been hiding here all along.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.920
Who are you?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.159
What do you want?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
Why is your neck so stiff?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
This ability is getting harder to control.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.759
Why is it lagging now?

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.919
I never expected

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.479
all three of us would end up on Earth.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.280
Speak.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.879
Why did you run away twenty years ago?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.919
Why do you sound so hoarse?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.800
Say it.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.520
What are you trying to do?

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.879
Say what?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.159
Speak.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.639
What am I supposed to say?

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.560
You should ask me first.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.879
Playing dumb, huh?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.719
Up to your old tricks again?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.919
I’m not scheming anything.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.080
All I have now is a crooked neck.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.919
How did I get a stiff neck from running?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.599
I take such good care of myself,

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.479
this shouldn’t happen.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.280
Earthling.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.639
You’ve got the wrong person.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.319
Then why are you running?

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.560
I suddenly remembered

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.759
I have to walk someone’s dog tonight.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.120
That dog’s mating howl

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.719
sounds a lot like your raspy voice.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.479
Such a normal kid,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.879
why do you have to keep your mouth open?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.080
It can move now.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.199
It’s too noisy.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.560
I didn’t say anything.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.800
The splashing in your head is too loud.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.560
Let’s go, quickly.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.080
Wait a second.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.479
I have a quick question.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.439
You’re an alien.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.680
The person you’re looking for isn’t my dad,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.879
Li Bu Zai, right?

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.240
So plain.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.600
Do you even need to test that?

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.560
This kid is so uncool.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.199
First time seeing plus and minus together.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240
Means he’s both an Earthling

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.439
and an alien.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.199
That’s right.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.199
Since you’ve figured it out,

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.920
I’ll kindly tell you,

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:37.720
I am the handsome and charming,

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.759
adorable and captivating,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.160
one and only in the universe,

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.560
Mixed-blood Prince with dual genes,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.480
Li Cai.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.639
Let’s play a “would you rather” game.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.680
How do we play?

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.959
Listen up.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.879
Say it.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.199
Ten centimeters taller

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.040
or ten kilograms lighter—which one?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.560
I’d pick ten kilograms lighter.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.079
Why?

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.199
If I were ten centimeters taller, I’d be taller than you.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.879
I’d be one seventy-eight too.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.399
Aren’t you one seventy-four?

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.040
With shoes, I’m one seventy-eight.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.240
Men—

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.560
talk about salary before tax,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.560
height after putting on shoes.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.800
Alright.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.959
I’ll give you one too.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.199
If baldness is your fate,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.639
would you choose to be bald in front or back?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.399
Bald in front.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.959
Why?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.839
It has to be the front.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.759
At least I can say I’m

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.040
flat in front, round in back,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.680
built for greatness,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.759
a handsome guy.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.160
Pick one:

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.040
my face

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.000
with Daniel Wu’s body,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.959
or Daniel Wu’s face with my body—

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.839
which do you choose?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.879
That’s a tough choice.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.879
Hard to pick.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.480
I prefer the original.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.439
You’re smooth with words.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.759
Of course.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.399
Daniel Wu’s perfection can’t be split.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.480
I have another one.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.360
I’m a globally wanted criminal

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.639
or I’m an alien—which one?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.399
Wanted criminal.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.120
Why?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.639
Then I can take you on the run worldwide.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.399
On the run around the world.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.240
Go out the window.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.720
Wanted criminal and accomplice spotted.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.560
A man,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.920
about one seventy-four tall,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040
one seventy-eight.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.639
With shoes.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.120
One seventy-eight.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.000
What if I’m an alien?

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.120
No way.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.480
Why not?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.120
Well,

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.800
um,

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:14.519
Alien,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.079
and Cloverfield,

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.839
you haven’t seen District 9, right?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.920
The aliens in those movies

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.319
are gross

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.480
and scary.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.759
I’m telling you,

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:25.639
if you make me choose between

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.639
alien

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.439
and wanted criminal,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.879
it means you don’t understand aliens at all.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.920
And you

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.680
probably don’t know me either.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.920
When I was little,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.839
I loved studying

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.720
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.600
and aliens.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.519
But later,

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.600
the more I learned,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.360
the more I realized

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:49.120
just

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.480
how terrifying it is.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.040
I’m conservative.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.800
I don’t recommend

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.240
Close encounter of the third kind.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.279
So you're saying

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.319
after your mom passed away,

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.199
your dad disappeared again.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.720
Just one year ago.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.000
I couldn't find him anywhere.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.600
He kept moving from place to place.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.279
People like him have a name on Earth.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.439
Scumbag.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.879
At my dad's age,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
he's not dead, is he?

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:21.879
For an alien like my dad,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.600
what happens when he dies?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.439
Dead scumbag.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.199
But unfortunately,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.040
he can't die.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.160
Because our lifespan

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.120
is three times longer

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:32.320
than humans'.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.120
How did you learn about your origins?

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.080
My dad left me a letter before he left.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.559
I carry it with me.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.000
It's pretty thick.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.320
Looks like

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.159
he had a lot to say to you.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.440
Son,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.360
I'm leaving.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:55.240
By the way,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.399
I'm an alien.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.519
You're mixed-blood.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.679
That's it.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:08:59.399
That's all?

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.120
You believed it?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.759
I did.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:02.360
No wonder

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.840
people always said I was weird.

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:05.120
I have to be weird.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.240
I'm half alien, half human.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.639
Um,

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:13.960
your dad—

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.559
what did he say about me?

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:16.639
He never mentioned you.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.720
Bastard.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.440
You hate my dad.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.840
Hate is love.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.240
Means you loved him deeply.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240
Pah, nonsense!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.120
On our home planet, we don't need feelings.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.840
Everything is matched by big data.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.960
We used an artificial womb

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.879
to create a little girl.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.159
We signed a contract

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.679
to raise her until she was five

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:38.759
then hand her to the government.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.440
But in the third year,

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.639
your dad vanished.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.559
He took all my money, too.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.080
Isn't that outrageous?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.000
Way too much.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.799
I have a half-sister.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.080
My dad never told me.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.799
That's not the point.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.759
The point is he broke the contract.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:09:59.519
Your dad—

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.480
did he leave you anything

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.840
valuable?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.679
Of course.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.960
My dad left me a fortune.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.960
There's a saying on Earth:

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.200
"The son pays the father's debt."

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.080
So the money he owes me,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440
you pay it back.

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:16.360
I will.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.200
The Ferrari last time—

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.279
did it drive well?

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.600
If you're free, come get the Lamborghini.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:27.120
I have to go now.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.000
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.000
When you pick me up tomorrow,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
will it be the Lamborghini?

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.039
Absolutely.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.000
Lamborghini.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.320
Goes perfectly with my dear Cai Yi.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.399
Let's say, for example,

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:56.360
aliens really came to Earth.

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.639
They want to interact with you.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.360
As Earth's representative,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.279
could you have a friendly meeting?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.399
No.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.559
I guess

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:10.279
real aliens must look terrifying,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.080
be violent,

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.039
and can't communicate with humans.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:16.399
Well,

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:18.639
what you're doing

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.000
is stereotyping aliens.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.600
What if some can communicate?

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.039
Then my answer is

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:26.679
a famous quote from "The Three-Body Problem":

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:28.440
Don't answer.

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:29.519
Don't answer.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:31.039
Don't answer.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:33.240
No, I mean, what if—

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.559
just in case,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.879
you spend time with this alien,

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:37.279
and find she's actually nice?

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:39.879
Different species.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.080
Can't coexist.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.879
Too cramped.

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:48.600
Even the bathroom's too small.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.240
Can't live together.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.840
Lili, hurry up!

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.080
Meng already drew the map.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.399
I—I...

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.039
Don't get me wrong, don't misunderstand.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.759
Don't get me wrong, I—

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.519
You're heading out so early?

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.600
Today is a good day.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.519
Everything you wish for will come true.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:11.440
Today and tomorrow are both good days.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:23.440
Cai Yi.

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:25.600
Over here.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.600
This time,

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.000
we've struck it rich.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.200
Your dad's doing pretty well on Earth.

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:47.080
What does he do?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.799
He's an experientialist.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.480
He does a bit of everything.

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:50.519
Oh, right.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.720
What did he do on the home planet?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.840
He was

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.440
in charge of maintaining asteroids
around the home planet.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:56.879
The cooling system.

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.679
He was a technician for the
entropy reduction effect.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.879
That's impressive.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.399
But on Earth, he's just an AC repairman.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.039
So why did he leave the home planet?

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.399
On our home planet,

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.240
one in a thousand people have

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:09.360
a genetic defect.

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.799
That means they

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.279
are born with a

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:14.519
chaotic, useless mechanism.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:15.279
It's

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:16.159
love.

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:18.360
Just saying it makes me sick.

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.919
You mean

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
you don't need love?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.080
Of course not.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.000
What's the point of that stuff?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240
But your dad hid it pretty well.

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.799
I never noticed.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.960
He slipped up after he had a daughter.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.200
Maybe he was afraid the government
would find out.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.360
So he ran away.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.240
Let's go.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.159
Let's take a walk.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.000
Where do you want to go?

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.200
Where do you live?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.919
Is this your place?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.360
Get me some shoe covers.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:58.919
It's fine.

00:13:58.919 --> 00:13:59.720
I'm not worried about your dirt.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.720
I'm worried about my shoes getting dirty.

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:03.960
Well,

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.159
Here.

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:14.679
They're mismatched.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.639
You must be loaded.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:25.399
You even have a room

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:26.080
just for piling up trash.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.320
Please, have a seat.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.039
I'll just stand.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:33.840
Alright.

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:35.600
I'm not greedy either.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.440
Just give me the Lamborghini.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:38.679
Then we're even.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.879
That's not my car.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.159
It's my rich friend's.

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:43.159
He has too many cars to drive.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:45.200
He's worried some cars get lonely
and neglected.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.840
So he hires me to walk his cars.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.320
That's your job?

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.279
Not entirely.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.279
The senior college pays me to walk wheelchairs.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.399
I'm just like my dad,

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.639
an experientialist too.

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:57.559
Enough nonsense.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.159
Didn't you say your dad left you a fortune?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.120
Hand it over.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:02.080
Alright.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.639
Here it is.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.799
The only fortune my dad left me

00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:16.879
is me.

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:19.759
Darn it.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.759
I officially present myself to you.

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:22.679
Since you're new to Earth,

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:23.960
I'm your local guide.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:24.759
Starting today,

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.799
I'll stay with you till the very end.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.399
You're not a fortune.

00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:32.039
You're bad debt.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.080
Auntie, don't go!

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.399
Don't you want your fortune?

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.960
Can you give me back the shoe covers?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.679
Can you stop following me?

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:42.440
You're so noisy.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.519
I didn't even say anything.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.080
Can't you hear how poor you sound?

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.080
I am poor,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.919
but I can earn money.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.480
I made one hundred today walking cars.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.840
Got a two hundred fine.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.919
Lend me one hundred first.

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:16.480
So basically,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.039
if I were an alien,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.559
you wouldn't like me either?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.559
But you're not.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:23.840
What if I was?

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.120
Are you?

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.080
I'm not.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.559
Why do you have to link everything
to aliens?

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:42.000
Let me put it this way.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.480
If you were an alien,

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.399
in your world,

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.480
I'd be an alien too.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.639
So,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.120
two outsiders in each other's eyes,

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:49.600
why force them together?

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.200
I'm just an ordinary guy

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:55.759
looking for an ordinary girl

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:56.440
to fall in love,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.320
get married,

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.559
and live a normal life.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.840
Is there anything wrong

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.840
with thinking like that?

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.519
Isn't it just a wild idea?

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:09.759
Why take it so seriously?

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.880
I just want someone

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.799
who can accept me,
even if I'm different.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.319
Someone who can accept me.

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.039
You can't leave today.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.319
You have to explain yourself today.

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:33.799
I have to go.

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:34.839
How many times have I told you?

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:35.160
I just...

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.640
No.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.640
Why can't you understand?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.839
No matter what you say,
you can't leave today.

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.200
I've been looking for you for days.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.960
How many times have I told you?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.319
Where did you go?

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:40.880
Alright, ma'am.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.720
If you're going to be like this,

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:42.799
then I have to run.

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:43.720
Stop right there!

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.279
You dog scoundrel!

00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:46.839
Stop!

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.119
You dog scoundrel!

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.119
Stop right there!

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.680
You...

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:52.200
Where do you think you're running?

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:54.839
Aunt Hua.

00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:55.880
Are you alright?

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:56.839
What's wrong with this guy?

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:57.720
Ask him.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.319
It's his doing.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.079
He even has a kid now.

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:01.799
Tell me,

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.079
how will you compensate me?

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.440
What's a kid?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Compensate for what?

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.440
This is beautiful love.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.319
Then you two go ahead and talk.

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:17.440
I can't handle this.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:18.119
Lili

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.119
It's not me.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.519
It's my girl.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.359
My girl, yeah.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.079
Then I can't help either.

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:27.039
My girl is a

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:28.839
bred-in-UK

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.000
purebred imported Border Collie.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:32.440
I paid money

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.720
to have him walk her for me.

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:34.559
But what happened?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.799
He let my girl

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.640
get with a stray mutt.

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:39.759
You know, did that.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.720
Now she had a litter of mixes.

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:43.880
What's wrong with mixes?

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.759
Mixes are the smartest.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:45.880
Auntie, let me be honest with you.

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:46.839
I'm a mix myself.

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:49.839
If you use yourself as proof,

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.759
that doesn't help your argument.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960
You just don't get it.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:56.119
I can sense animals' emotions.

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.720
I clearly felt

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:58.920
her girl and that mutt

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960
are truly in love.

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:01.119
I'm just helping

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.240
a beautiful dog romance.

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:03.720
Beautiful, my ass!

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:04.839
My girl

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.839
was supposed to mate with a purebred

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.799
Border Collie.

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:11.039
Now look what happened.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.359
She's totally lost her value.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.039
You have to compensate me.

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:14.960
Auntie,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.920
bloodline,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.039
breed, species, group—

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.039
they're just ignorant, silly labels

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:21.119
that humans stick on things.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.680
At its core,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.200
it's just two loving souls

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:25.599
in the vast universe

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.599
forming quantum entanglement of feelings and desire.

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.200
That makes sense.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:32.000
Right?

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:33.480
Actually, we humans

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.359
are the same.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.359
All our lives,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.279
everything we do

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.119
is just to

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.880
find that

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:39.599
person who resonates with us.

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:40.440
Isn't that right?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.440
Yes.

00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:43.880
So isn't that beautiful?

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:45.039
It is.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.400
So I don't have to pay, right?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.640
Just pay up already,

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.000
and be done with it.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.000
Thanks.

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.200
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.559
About this matter,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.920
I won't press it anymore.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.359
So tell me,

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.519
what about this litter of mixes?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.400
How about this—

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:07.519
bring them to my dad's pet shop tomorrow.

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.960
I'll help you find

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:09.920
people to adopt them.

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:11.680
You promise?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.039
Thank you.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.200
The kindness of strangers

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.440
always moves me.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.759
I'm Li Cai.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.799
As for you,

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:25.839
I'm definitely making you my friend.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.920
No problem.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.000
Normally,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.519
I wouldn't bother with this stuff.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.559
But today just hit my emotional spot.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.480
Let's add each other on WeChat.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.440
I'll scan your code.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.440
Can I ask you about someone?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.400
Do you know an auntie

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.519
with a bit of a temper,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.519
kind of edgy,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.519
with a bird on her clothes,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.720
and a bit of good looks?

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.079
A bird on her clothes?

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.720
If it's about a bird,

00:20:56.759 --> 00:20:59.000
I do remember someone.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.000
What did she do to you?

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:03.000
She's my dad's ex-wife.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.839
She's your dad's ex-wife?

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.880
No way, you must be mistaken.

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:08.680
Really.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:09.920
Let me tell you a secret.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.160
This secret—

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:11.960
I don't tell just anyone.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:12.839
But I'll tell you.

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:13.680
My dad

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.480
is an alien.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.680
Your dad is an alien?

00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:22.640
And the person you mentioned

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.640
is your dad's ex-wife?

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:32.119
You're my mom's ex-husband's son?

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:39.319
So you're my...

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.720
brother.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.640
Brother.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.480
What a lousy day, right?

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.160
Mom, mom, mom!

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:01.440
I want to talk to you about something.

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:01.960
Go ahead.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.559
Well...

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.960
I think Lili

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:06.960
was a bit

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:07.960
strange today.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.880
She's always been strange.

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:11.920
Is this news to you?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.319
Yeah.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:15.519
She's always been strange.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.839
Isn't that why you like her?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.480
Otherwise, how would you two be together?

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:22.240
If, say,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.640
her appearance changed,

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:27.799
I mean,

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.480
she became unrecognizable,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.359
not even looking human anymore,

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:36.319
what then?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Would you still be into that?

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:39.839
What are you talking about?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.039
Even if Lili turned back into an alien,

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.599
she'd still be the same.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.839
She is who she is.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.759
I'm not saying she's an alien.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.039
I'm just making a point.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.720
Just...

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.720
if she were an alien,

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.400
if she wasn't from Earth,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.359
she would...

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480
I can't talk about this anymore.

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:57.960
I need to go to the bar and ask around.

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:01.759
Didn't you just get back?

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.920
Her weirdness is inherited.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.960
Come down.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.519
Come down.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.799
I mean you, come down.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.160
You have to come down too.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.720
Honestly, I've always wanted a sister.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.720
I never thought

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:37.960
I'd have a younger brother.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.279
Oh wow, I finally have family.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:43.720
Don't you have a mom?

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.839
My mom and I

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.880
don't really have feelings.

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:51.440
Back on our home planet,

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:53.519
the government gives out a parenting manual.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.680
Moms just follow the instructions

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.559
step by step

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.359
to raise their kids, that's it.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.319
No need to show any emotion.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.400
So before I came to Earth,

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:04.440
"Mom"

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.319
was just a code name to me.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.160
Just a title.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.359
Like this cup,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.279
this chair,

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.480
and that bald guy.

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:11.680
No difference at all.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:14.799
Oh wow.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.839
So our home planet is all about restraint.

00:24:17.359 --> 00:24:18.440
That's so cool.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.839
Now I finally get

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.039
why I'm not normal.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.000
I must take after Dad too much.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.240
That's why I don't fit in on Earth.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:27.039
You're overthinking it.

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:30.079
Dad didn't fit in on the home planet

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:31.079
so he came to Earth.

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:34.319
In a way,

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:35.960
he's more like an Earthling.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.000
I wonder

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.960
when he came here,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.480
if he was as confused as I am.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.599
An outcast on the home planet,

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:45.920
a stranger on Earth too.

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:48.599
This kind of loneliness—

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.279
have you ever felt it?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.759
Not at all.

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:54.279
Because I'm the Mixed-blood Prince.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.559
So I'm a foreigner everywhere.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:56.839
On Earth,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.240
there are outsiders everywhere.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.359
You have a good attitude.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.680
Learned from Dad.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.400
He said life is long,

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:07.640
happiness matters most.

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:13.960
When Dad left back then,

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:15.200
I was too young.

00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:17.599
I barely remember him.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.880
What kind of person was he?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.160
From what I recall,

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:25.599
he loved my mom

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.759
but hated bathing.

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.680
He loved cooking for me,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.799
but everything he made was burnt.

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:33.319
He had an old bike.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:34.759
When I was little,

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.400
he'd take me to catch dragonflies.

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:37.920
I have proof.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:40.240
Where?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:40.960
In my mouth.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.079
Missing a tooth.

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.240
Sounds more like

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.559
proof you ate too much candy.

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:50.200
Wrong.

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:51.079
This tooth

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.920
was lost when he took me on his bike

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.799
and kicked me off the back seat.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.720
I lost it in the fall.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.440
Dad's aim was pretty good.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.000
Oh right,

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:02.839
he talked in his sleep.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.079
In your language.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:05.119
I recorded it once.

00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.000
Let me find it for you.

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:13.359
Here.

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:49.400
Sis,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.599
what did he actually say?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.119
My name.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:12.640
This should be

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.160
what I look like now.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640
He used the name Li Bu Zai.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.799
Help me ask around.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.880
Darn it.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.799
They ran into each other.

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.960
Sis, how long have you been listening?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.279
Your phone's out of battery.

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:43.160
Aren't you tired of it?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.039
Why are you getting emotional, sis?

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:31.240
I remember what happened the day Dad left.

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:32.160
What?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.440
That day,

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:39.200
Dad said he'd take me away

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:41.759
to a beautiful, passionate planet.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.559
Once we got there,

00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:45.880
we could start a new life.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.480
He meant Earth.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:52.319
But

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.640
right before boarding the ship,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.359
I suddenly thought of my mom.

00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:01.400
I thought,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.160
if I left,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.160
I'd never see her again.

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:09.400
She'd lose both me and Dad.

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:12.480
How sad would that be?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.799
So I let go of Dad's hand

00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:18.519
and ran home.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.440
That was the last time I saw Dad.

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.319
That's so touching, sis.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.079
It's okay.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.720
This kid...

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.559
It's okay.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.319
Mom.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.680
This is—

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.359
I know.

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:03.000
Auntie.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.599
Do you know the day Dad left you?

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:11.079
I know you don't like me because of him.

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.440
But I really want to be part of your lives.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.640
Let me put it this way—

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.000
If you don't agree,

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.039
I'll cry to death right here.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.319
If he latches onto you,

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:24.720
you can't shake him off.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.640
Are you sure

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.759
you want this brother?

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.400
At least now

00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:36.680
I don't feel so alone.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.039
Like I said before—

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.920
The son pays the father's debt.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.880
From now on,

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:45.880
the money you earn

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.000
you'll hand over a share to me.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.039
Why should I?

00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:53.759
My mom accepts you now.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.200
That's what it means.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.440
Alright, alright.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.319
The power's out.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440
Probably forgot to pay the bill.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:34.759
Lili.

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:37.839
I get it now.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.039
I know why you're upset.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.720
Why?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.440
Because you're not an ordinary girl.

00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:52.519
You figured it out.

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:54.400
I...

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.079
I'm as ordinary as it gets.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.519
I once said

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:01.079
I wanted to find a normal girl

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:03.079
to fall in love, get married,

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.400
and live a regular life.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:05.880
But today,

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.039
I finally realized

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.880
I fell for you

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:11.200
precisely because

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.400
you're not ordinary.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.160
You're stranger than anyone I've met.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.240
Every day we're together,

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:24.440
you get even stranger.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.039
It's your strangeness

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.279
that, to me,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.440
is the most precious kind of charm.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.200
I don't care who you are.

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.119
Whether you're a fugitive,

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:41.839
an alien,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.119
or even

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:45.799
a thousand-year-old monster,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.359
you're still yourself.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.799
You're the one

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.480
I've always wanted to be with.

00:32:59.079 --> 00:33:00.680
Actually, I...

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.359
You know if you tell him now

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.160
you're really an alien,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.000
he'd probably faint.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.759
I'm not planning to say it.

00:33:11.599 --> 00:33:12.839
Actually, I...

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:20.000
am not myself.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.400
Lili.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.079
You've lost weight.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.200
Um...

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.720
Actually, I want to introduce you.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.680
This is my brother.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:44.720
Half-brother.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.119
Brother-in-law.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.799
Brother-in-law.

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:51.599
I have a brother-in-law now.

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:52.599
Brother-in-law.

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:54.160
What you said just now was touching.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.960
The price of romance

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.719
is messy candle wax.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.639
This sofa's pretty comfy.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.280
You're making yourself at home.

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:28.920
Moved in on your first day.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.239
Alright.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.480
I'll make do on the sofa tonight.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.960
Then make do for the night.

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.679
It's been ages since my sister and I reunited.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.920
Tonight we need a good talk.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.880
You should get some sleep.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.360
Sis.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.519
Sis.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.239
Even stranger than his sister.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.480
From what I've seen,

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:51.599
human eyes nowadays

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.920
are just label makers.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.599
They never take the time

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:55.519
to look deeper inside

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:56.159
and truly know someone.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.960
They just stick labels on each other

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.000
and sort people into boxes.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.039
Though few are as genuine as me,

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:06.320
and loved by all,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.559
I still hope

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:08.599
people use time

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:09.760
not labels

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.760
to get to know each other.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.159
Just like it.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.760
Obedient and cute.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.599
Smart and lively.

00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:20.199
But humans,

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:21.119
sometimes...

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:24.039
Alright.

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:24.760
Stop picking.
