00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700
(Tomorrow, you're going somewhere.)

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.300
(See how many people
smoke opium every day.)

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.765
(And it's all thanks to your father.)

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.699
Things are tight lately.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.099
The higher-ups want us to keep watch.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.019
If you see a stranger,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.340
don't let them go.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.980
You, at the door.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.700
Bring that opium paste inside.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.579
Little witch.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.660
Liu Kui?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.700
I'd recognize those eyes of yours
even if you turned to ashes!

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.099
- What are you doing?
- You made me less of a man.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.499
I'll make you pay with your life!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.339
Let go.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.140
Let go of me.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.780
Let go of me.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.860
What's going on in there?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.459
Say...

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.260
Be gentle.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.660
Gentle.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.820
Easy, Mr. Kui.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.099
Mr. Kui,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.074
what's going on?

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:45.835
Get out.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.900
Thank you, Mr. Kui.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.539
Darn it. He knows how to have fun.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.961
Treating an opium den like a brothel.

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:56.939
Liu Kui doesn't even
have his parts anymore,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.060
and he's still that fired up.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.059
Mr. Lin, you really know the act.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.700
You play it
like you've done it for years.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.859
Just that?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.420
And you think you can be my blade?

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.019
Wait.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.939
That build...

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.739
That's not Liu Kui!

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.620
Move!

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.099
Mr. Kui is dead!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.019
Go after them!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.459
Go!

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.220
Go!

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.299
(Why does the opium paste
smell so familiar?)

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.699
(I have to figure out)

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.420
(what's really going on.)

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.860

This poison can devour your life.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.936

♪Overestimating myself♪

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.500
Wulingzhi.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.060
Why does it smell like wulingzhi?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.620
Wulingzhi…

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.300
Only the Liang's Apothecary
has wulingzhi in the whole city.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.739
Impossible.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.219
My father would never do this.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.379
Impossible!

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.539
Why not?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.960
You said it yourself.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.739
The opium must have come into the city
mixed with your Liang family's herbs.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.739
Besides,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.939
this stuff makes a fortune.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.939
It's only natural that your father
was chasing profit.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.860
I told you my father
would never do something so cruel!

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.099
It was Song Zhichu.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.059
It has to be Song Zhichu.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.420
I'm going to report him.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.580
Report him?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.860
And how would you report him?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.499
Song Ming

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.739
is the mayor of Rong City.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.160
With all the awful things
Song Zhichu has done over the years,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.860
his father has always looked away.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.140
Now that Song Ming is running
for provincial chairman,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.540
he'll clean up everything for him.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.699
Besides,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.020
do you trust your father that much?

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.020
Why did he marry you off
to Song Zhichu?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.300
Have you ever wondered?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.059
(If the mastermind
really is Song Zhichu,)

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.436
(the opium den owner must have proof.)

00:06:06.437 --> 00:06:09.219
(If I can get my hands on it,)

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.420
(I can clear my father's name.)

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.699
You mean

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.459
they mixed the opium

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.060
into the wulingzhi?

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.019
But we checked the Liang herbs.
We never found anything.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.780
They disguised it as an ointment.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.740
What's this invitation?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.780
A Dai family banquet. They invited you,
Song Zhichu, and his wife.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.380
I'm not going.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.980
Of course you're going.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.060
It's a perfect chance
to break this stalemate.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.659
Song Zhichu's opium must still be
in the Liang warehouse.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.379
He'll never let us in.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.299
However,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.220
there's someone who will.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.940
Lu Man.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.739
You just slapped her.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.299
You really think she'll take you inside?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.859
That Dai lady

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.579
is the type who'll repay
even the smallest slight.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.739
Aren't you the one who writes plays?

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.019
Tell me.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.939
In this next act,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.460
how should the story go?

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.459
Come, come.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.340
Make yourselves at home.
Let's begin.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.700
Careful with your sleeve.

00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:34.477
Ah.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.980
This bracelet looks quite precious.

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.385
Madam Lin, you have good eyes.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.779
This jade bracelet

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.060
was a token of love
my husband gave me back then.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.900
Madam Dai and Mr. Dai's love
really makes others envious.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.580
Ah!

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.140
The bracelet!

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:12.899
I didn't...

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.740
Please don't be upset, Madam Dai.
She definitely didn't mean it.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.849
Rumor has it that

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.540
after Madam Song married Chief Song,
their love isn't what it used to be.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.979
But even so,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.580
there's no need
to resent other couples being happy.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.059
Chief Song is right here.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.139
It's just a bracelet.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.380
I'll find you
an even better one another day.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.300
Please don't take offense, Chief Song.
Women don't always watch their tongues.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.699
Madam Dai,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.140
my apologies.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.179
(The firewood is ready.)

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.140
(Time to fan the flames.)

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.579
Good music and good dancing,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.779
both pleasing to the eyes and ears.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.939
I heard Madam Dai studied abroad.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.060
You must dance Western styles well.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.179
I manage.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.660
Madam Dai's tango is legendary
in the foreign concessions.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.580
But if we're talking about breathtaking,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.600
Madam Song's “Evening Primrose”
at the Governor's Mansion back then

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.470
even had the French consul entranced.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.579
Since the topic has come this far,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.259
why don't Madam Song and I
dance together today

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.020
and see how we compare?

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.699
Rather than a comparison,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.579
let's say it's for everyone's enjoyment.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.540
No need to be shy.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.460
(The real show begins.)

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.979
Madam Song,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.659
did you learn your steps
from a village troupe?

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.779
I hurt my leg before.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.236
I haven't danced in a long time.

00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:46.379
Madam Dai,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.286
my apologies.

00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:48.859
I see.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.740
You...

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.099
Madam Song's dancing

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.539
has really

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.820
opened my eyes.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.099
Watching them dance
is making me eager to join in.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.979
Why don't we take a turn too?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.460
What are you planning?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.979
Helping her out, of course.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.500
Only then will she open up to us.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.140
Let's go.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.180
You helped me again.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.699
If this situation continues,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.180
you could be offending the Song family.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.020
Wait for me.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.019
Madam, what a move.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.374
First, you use me as a weapon,

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.499
then you use me as bait,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.899
letting your husband charm
your ex-husband's wife.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.819
Does the method matter?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.099
In times like these,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.820
survival is what matters.

00:13:21.787 --> 00:13:23.257
Where's my earring?

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:25.716
Can't you be a little smarter next time?

00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:28.516
We almost got exposed today, you know?

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.374
You didn't come to my help either.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:31.124
If you can't dance,

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:32.920
simply make up an excuse!

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.100
Stay away from Xu Yin from now on.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.499
(Lin Yun,)

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.660
(Don't blame me.)

00:14:12.387 --> 00:14:14.736
(You've been too useful.)

00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:16.074
What are you

00:14:16.075 --> 00:14:17.220
doing?
