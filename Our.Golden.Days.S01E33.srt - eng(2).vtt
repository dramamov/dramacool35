00:00:02.696 --> 00:00:03.796
What do you two think you're doing?

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.166
(Episode 33)

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:10.296
I knew you were up to something when you played innocent for your dad.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:14.906
Your father will be thrilled when he finds out, won't he?

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.436
He's fired. Effective immediately.

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:20.206
You can't do that, Mom.

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.416
The fact that Woo Jin is trying to get a liver transplant.

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:24.346
Should I go ahead and tell Dad about that?

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:28.916
You...

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:31.556
So that's how you found out. You were tracking me.

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:37.026
How dare you put a tracking device on my car?

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.196
You did the same thing to me.

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:42.336
I did that to keep you from getting out of line,

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:47.066
and to make you a desirable bride. It was for your own protection.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:48.976
I did it for myself, too.

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:51.746
By tailing me just so you could blackmail me?

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:55.946
Even if I tried to explain,

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:59.186
- you wouldn't understand. - You...

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:03.756
Yes. Something did seem off about you.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:06.926
I couldn't put my finger on it, but you'd changed.

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:09.826
So it was all because of him, wasn't it?

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.426
- Did he put you up to this? - It's not like that.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:16.096
Not like that? Then why were you two so cosy?

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:19.436
Do you realise how hard I've worked to keep your reputation pristine?

00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:21.876
That's what made you such a prime catch.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:25.606
What we should be talking about right now...

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:28.006
is Woo Jin.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.516
You'd really tell Dad about Woo Jin's transplant situation?

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.726
Even though you know exactly what that would do to our family?

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:44.026
You won't do it.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:46.666
Yes, I will.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.266
If Dad finds out and loses it,

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.136
you're the one who's going to get hurt,

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:54.206
not me.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:56.676
And what about you?

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:58.745
What will he do when he learns the bodyguard he hired...

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:00.206
fooled around with you?

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:04.276
There's nothing he hates more than betrayal by someone he trusts.

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:06.146
What do you think will happen to you and that punk?

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:08.486
It's not like that between Ji Wan and me.

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:11.416
- We're not even dating. - Don't lie to me. I saw you myself.

00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:12.486
Mom.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.126
If I say it's not true, shouldn't you just believe me?

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:21.666
I can be completely honest with Dad.

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.636
It's true that Ji Wan and I got close,

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:30.306
but I have a clear conscience. I can look Dad right in the eye...

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:32.676
and tell him the complete truth.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:36.876
What did you just say?

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:39.816
But...

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:44.416
there's no reason for either of us to upset Dad right now, is there?

00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:50.756
But, Mom...

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:54.866
Why did you hide that Woo Jin was sick?

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:05.806
All right. Fine.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:08.516
Go ahead. Have your fun.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:11.546
Come to think of it,

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.146
maybe it's because you've never had the chance to let loose.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:15.716
But...

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:17.756
as for you and him fooling around,

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:21.386
I can't stop your father from finding out on his own.

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.636
And you keep your mouth shut about Woo Jin.

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:33.536
Understood.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.506
Should I really be waiting out here?

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:43.016
Director Ko wouldn't hit her, would she?

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:46.616
Oh, no.

00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:07.436
Yeong Ra.

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:10.936
How did it go?

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:13.906
She said she'd tell my dad and get you fired,

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:18.146
so I threatened to tell him she hid Woo Jin's liver transplant.

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:20.886
You did what?

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:24.156
I had no other choice.

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.486
No, I mean...

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:29.196
What possessed you to do that?

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:34.366
She saw us in such a weird situation.

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:36.566
And it's not like my mom is someone you can reason with.

00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:40.406
But I couldn't just stand by and let you get fired.

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:43.836
Before I knew it, the words...

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:45.576
just came blurting out.

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:49.046
Wait, so you're saying...

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:52.916
you just cut a deal with Director Ko?

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:57.386
So? Did it work?

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.886
- And she agreed to your terms? - She didn't have a choice.

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:02.826
She lied to my dad.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.366
This is a huge deal.

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:09.796
So, does this mean I can keep my job?

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:12.836
Of course. That's the whole reason I made a deal with her.

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:17.136
By the way, Ji Wan.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:19.246
We're signing with Neiro tomorrow, right?

00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:20.576
Why?

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:22.776
- Nervous? - No.

00:05:23.276 --> 00:05:24.346
I'm just eager to get started.

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:30.056
That little brat thinks she can threaten me?

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:35.726
That punk she's with must have given her the idea.

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.796
Fine.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:40.626
Go ahead. Do your worst.

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.796
Because I'm going to put everything right back where it belongs.

00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:49.076
- I'm home. - Hey.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:54.476
- Dad, you're home early. - Yes, I am.

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.876
Yeong Ra, sit down. We need to talk.

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:07.956
Honey. Apparently, Yeong Ra's decided to stop painting.

00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:09.096
She says it's too much for her.

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:14.196
She realised it after her solo show. She just wants to do it as a hobby.

00:06:16.936 --> 00:06:19.766
You must have had a tough time preparing for your solo show.

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:23.636
It's true, being an artist is no easy feat.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.506
Yeong Ra is starting to get tech neck.

00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:28.646
Right, Yeong Ra?

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:32.046
You don't want to be stuck at an easel all day, do you?

00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:34.916
Right.

00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:37.556
What is Mom up to?

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:43.626
Yeong Ra turns 26 in the new year. She needs to get married next year,

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:45.156
while she's in her prime.

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:50.936
I think Yeong Ra should run her own gallery.

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:53.766
You could even set one up for her, couldn't you?

00:06:53.966 --> 00:06:55.936
I suppose so.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:59.246
It's not like women just support men from home these days.

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:04.016
So I'm going to clear out Yeong Ra's art studio.

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:07.486
- What? - Why so suddenly?

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:11.186
Since no one's home during the day anyway,

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:14.325
she can relax and do her hobbies...

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:16.526
while working on her graduate thesis.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:21.566
There's time for classes, cooking, Pilates, and English lessons.

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:25.066
Yeong Ra, if that's what you want, go for it.

00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:29.236
She's trying to take our space away from Ji Wan and me.

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:35.146
Honey, can we let Ji Wan stay on as her bodyguard?

00:07:35.816 --> 00:07:39.516
The trial date is set, but the verdict is months away.

00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:41.916
Of course.

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:45.626
I didn't fire Lee Ji Wan.

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:47.126
Happy now?

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.866
I wasn't going to be an artist forever anyway.

00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:55.366
I always thought the studio was too big.

00:07:57.096 --> 00:07:58.736
I'll clear my stuff out first thing.

00:08:09.346 --> 00:08:12.146
Emergency! We're in huge trouble.

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:13.416
(Emergency! We're in huge trouble.)

00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:21.326
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:08:24.096 --> 00:08:26.866
Just tell her this liver transplant is about saving a life.

00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:29.436
That's all you need to say to your sister.

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:32.236
I'm done in the kitchen.

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:33.936
I'm done too.

00:08:35.476 --> 00:08:38.176
Mom, when is Eun Oh getting admitted to the hospital?

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:39.546
Why would your sister be admitted?

00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:42.546
Oh, that. She decided not to go through with it.

00:08:43.676 --> 00:08:47.046
She told you she's backing out? So she must be really scared.

00:08:47.616 --> 00:08:50.556
It's not like my sister to back out after she already set the date.

00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:53.686
What reason did she give? That she's scared?

00:08:55.126 --> 00:08:57.126
- Hey. - You two look wiped out.

00:08:57.526 --> 00:08:58.726
Hey, what brings you here?

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:01.326
I need to talk to you.

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:03.036
Funny you should say that.

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:06.436
Because today, I'm the one who needs to talk to Mom.

00:09:07.036 --> 00:09:09.336
Here? All right, we can all talk together then.

00:09:09.876 --> 00:09:12.106
No, not today.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:15.376
Gang Oh, grab two bottles of soju for us, and you can head out.

00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:17.076
Soju?

00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:18.846
Eun Oh, what is it?

00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:25.426
So that woman...

00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:30.726
I found proof she only sought me out for the liver transplant.

00:09:31.126 --> 00:09:32.226
So that's what happened.

00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:33.896
My goodness...

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.236
So that's what was going on all along.

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:39.536
No wonder...

00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:41.966
I know.

00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:46.746
You must've been suffering so much, my poor girl.

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.576
I'm still suffering.

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:54.086
What can I do to help? What? What do you need?

00:09:54.186 --> 00:09:57.616
Should I go find that woman and make sure she never returns?

00:09:57.686 --> 00:09:59.526
Should I just break both her legs?

00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:03.156
Don't do anything.

00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:06.226
She won't come looking for me again.

00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:10.866
She won't be able to change my mind. I made that clear to her.

00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.236
I even...

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:16.376
I even told her I wouldn't do it...

00:10:17.236 --> 00:10:19.006
specifically because he's her son.

00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:23.116
My goodness.

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:26.486
That must have torn you up inside.

00:10:27.446 --> 00:10:29.356
She tore your heart to shreds.

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:35.956
Mom.

00:10:36.756 --> 00:10:40.626
Thanks for holding back your tears and listening to me.

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:45.936
But I can see you're trying so hard not to cry.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:50.876
Crying over a woman like that would be a waste of tears.

00:10:59.046 --> 00:11:00.046
Ji Gang Oh.

00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:01.716
Oh, hey.

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:05.986
What? Were you waiting out here in case Mom and I got into a fight?

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:08.026
No, it's not that.

00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:10.225
So what did you two talk about?

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:11.626
- What? - Oh, boy.

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:14.466
Mom, why don't you tell Gang Oh everything?

00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:17.796
He's my brother, so he should know too.

00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:20.136
So, she was only after the liver from the start?

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:23.606
That's what she said. That evil witch.

00:11:23.736 --> 00:11:26.445
How can she be so shameless?

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:28.406
I know she abandoned Eun Oh, but she's still her daughter.

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.646
Gosh, what a piece of work.

00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:35.046
But thank goodness Eun Oh found out before the transplant.

00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:36.985
Exactly. She can't have the surgery...

00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:38.926
- for a crazy person like that. - Exactly.

00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:44.926
What's wrong?

00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:50.336
Mom.

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:52.906
I'm in big trouble.

00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:55.206
I really messed up.

00:11:56.676 --> 00:11:57.876
What did you do?

00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:00.776
I just assumed she would go through with the surgery,

00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:03.946
so when her birth mom offered money, I took it.

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:05.276
What?

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:08.816
She said she was going to give us thank-you money anyway.

00:12:08.886 --> 00:12:10.856
When I thought about it from her perspective,

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:13.486
- it only seemed right she pay us. - So wait.

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:16.126
You took the money? Is that what you're saying?

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:17.856
How much?

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:22.396
Five hundred thousand dollars.

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:26.206
You... Are you crazy?

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:30.636
Are you insane? You took money from the woman who wanted her liver?

00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.976
- I can't believe this. You fool! - Gosh, that hurts.

00:12:33.876 --> 00:12:36.846
You're going to be the death of me! I swear, you really are!

00:12:39.846 --> 00:12:41.146
I haven't spent a single penny.

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.056
For real.

00:12:46.826 --> 00:12:48.386
That venomous, evil woman.

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.956
Doing whatever it takes to steal Eun Oh's liver.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:53.466
Unbelievable.

00:12:54.466 --> 00:12:56.166
I'll return it tomorrow and set her straight.

00:12:56.236 --> 00:12:57.366
And I'll apologise to Eun Oh.

00:12:57.696 --> 00:13:00.436
- No, I will beg for forgiveness. - But, my sister...

00:13:03.176 --> 00:13:04.206
Let's keep this a secret from her.

00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:05.606
What?

00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:07.946
You...

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:11.346
Don't you ever tell Eun Oh you took that money.

00:13:12.616 --> 00:13:15.085
She's already heartbroken over...

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.186
what her birth mother is truly like.

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:20.986
What if she finds out her own brother was paid off?

00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:23.456
How devastated do you think she'd be?

00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:28.426
It would crush Eun Oh. We can't do that to her.

00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:33.806
You lunatic. You fool!

00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:42.076
I guess you'd better start looking for a place.

00:13:42.716 --> 00:13:44.316
Where at? Somewhere around here?

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:47.345
I'm torn between a studio near work...

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:49.716
or a one-bedroom apartment in Eun Oh's neighbourhood.

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:51.616
I haven't decided yet.

00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:53.656
Why? Is it because of Eun Oh?

00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:55.856
Yes, pretty much.

00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:01.266
Dreaming of a future together?

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:05.536
It's not like I'm planning it out. I just can't help but picture it.

00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:09.506
I can't imagine my life without Eun Oh in it anymore.

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:13.206
Man, Ji Hyuk. Who knew?

00:14:14.546 --> 00:14:16.916
I guess this is what they mean when they say timing is everything.

00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:20.516
Wait.

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:21.986
It's about time for Eun Oh to get here.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:24.656
- Hey, in front of Eun Oh... - Relax, I won't say a thing.

00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:26.856
Would I say I'm relieved she now knows who her birth mother is,

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:29.056
or that I'm glad she's not doing the liver transplant?

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:33.866
There's nothing anyone can say to comfort Eun Oh right now.

00:14:40.806 --> 00:14:41.806
Sir.

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:44.206
- My gosh. - There's more.

00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:45.336
Here, let me get those.

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:48.546
Thanks. You can get back to your work.

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.866
Director Ko really knows how to hit you where it hurts.

00:15:11.466 --> 00:15:14.536
So her goal is to get rid of any place we can be together.

00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:19.676
So, does that mean we shouldn't sign the contract today?

00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:23.346
She could have people come and clear this place out as early as tomorrow.

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:27.016
Gosh, where are you going to draw your webtoon then?

00:15:29.986 --> 00:15:32.526
Should we find you a new studio?

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:34.926
A studio?

00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:37.456
You're getting a 3,000-dollar signing bonus.

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:41.826
A studio for 3,000 dollars? Come on, that's way too small.

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:45.436
Look, new artists like you don't normally get a signing bonus.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.336
Usually, you just get paid an artist's fee per episode.

00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:50.336
They only gave you a signing bonus because you were so reluctant.

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:51.976
What did you just say?

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:53.946
An "artist's fee?"

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:58.146
Yes, for artists, it's called a creator's fee.

00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:03.716
A "creator's fee." That sounds so cool.

00:16:04.286 --> 00:16:05.826
Let's find our studio right away, Ji Wan.

00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:09.196
I can just pay for it myself, right? How much do we need?

00:16:09.496 --> 00:16:11.096
A 50,000-dollar deposit? 100,000?

00:16:11.496 --> 00:16:13.566
- One hundred thousand? - Let's just find one fast.

00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:17.036
It'll be fine as long as I'm the one to break it to my dad.

00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:21.406
I've already figured out what to say so Mom can't argue.

00:16:23.136 --> 00:16:27.076
Like mother, like daughter. You have a trick up your sleeve too?

00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:30.876
Because I want to keep drawing my webtoon.

00:16:33.386 --> 00:16:34.386
In that case, Yeong Ra...

00:16:35.586 --> 00:16:39.956
If you're using your own money, why not use what you've earned?

00:16:40.426 --> 00:16:43.756
As it's a studio for your webtoon, you could use your signing bonus.

00:16:44.356 --> 00:16:45.526
With the 3,000 dollars?

00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:50.636
You can pay the rent with the fee you get for each episode.

00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:55.536
But can you really find a studio with just 3,000 dollars?

00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:00.606
If I found one with that money...

00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:05.616
That would be even more fun.

(Neiro)

00:17:14.026 --> 00:17:15.456
Like I mentioned before,

00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:18.926
I really don't want my real identity to be revealed.

00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:22.566
Most creators use a pen name, so we're used to it.

00:17:22.836 --> 00:17:23.866
Don't worry.

00:17:23.996 --> 00:17:27.406
I'd prefer if you'd email or text me as much as possible.

00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:29.176
Understood.

00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:31.836

Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:47.586
Now, let's go look at some studios.

00:17:48.256 --> 00:17:49.256
Okay.

00:17:51.096 --> 00:17:52.096
Oh, dear.

00:18:02.406 --> 00:18:05.276
Are you sure someone actually lived here?

00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:08.076
Since it's a popular area,

00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:12.146
this is what you can get for that deposit.

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.146
Yeong Ra, this place won't work.

00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:16.256
Let's see something else.

00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:24.156
Okay, no mold, no signs of leaks.

00:18:24.496 --> 00:18:25.896
Hey, this one might actually work.

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:29.126
Oh, have a look around.

00:18:32.536 --> 00:18:33.806
It's so cramped.

00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:36.876
So people actually live in places like this.

00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:39.446
It's the perfect place to focus on your webtoon.

00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:44.576
It's hard to find a studio I actually like.

00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:47.615
You're getting your 1st studio with your 1st signing bonus.

00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:49.016
You have to start somewhere.

00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:51.516
You're right.

00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:53.756
I guess this is it, right?

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:57.896
I'll give the walls a new paint job and make it look brand new for you.

00:18:59.366 --> 00:19:02.426
Oh, it'd be great if we could replace that sink, too.

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:03.836
It's so grimy.

00:19:04.196 --> 00:19:07.766
Who replaces the sink in a rental? We can just clean it.

00:19:08.236 --> 00:19:10.706
On second thought, my brother's the CEO of AP, right?

00:19:10.976 --> 00:19:13.646
If I get some contact paper for it, it'll look totally brand new.

00:19:14.476 --> 00:19:17.346
So that our dear artist, Freedom, can focus solely on her work,

00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:19.646
Manager Lee will get everything set up for you.

00:19:20.846 --> 00:19:21.846
"Manager?"

00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:26.756
Bodyguard, chauffeur, and now my manager.

00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:29.456
You're doing all this just for me.

00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:32.996
I guess I am. I'm doing it all, aren't I?

00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:46.105
I gave him the money two days ago, yet still nothing.

00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:48.106
Why hasn't she called me?

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:52.146
After getting the money, she should have called first.

00:19:55.416 --> 00:19:57.216
You know you're being admitted the day after tomorrow, right?

00:19:57.886 --> 00:20:00.926
Follow the hospital's instructions and be ready to check in.

00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:02.086
Ma'am.

00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:04.726
That woman from the other day is here again.

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:07.596
- "That woman?" - The one who grabbed your hair.

00:20:12.966 --> 00:20:14.036
Show her in.

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:16.236
Yes.

00:20:26.386 --> 00:20:28.716
Oh, dear. Unbelievable.

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:31.886
You're the one who's always stirring things up.

00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:33.855
What? What's all this? What are you doing?

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:36.126
My gosh! What is your problem?

00:20:43.966 --> 00:20:45.866
Don't get up. I'm not staying.

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:48.666
After what Eun Oh told me, I don't even want to talk to you.

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:50.176
You vile woman.

00:20:50.676 --> 00:20:52.306
What's the meaning of this?

00:20:52.946 --> 00:20:55.746
- Did Eun Oh say it wasn't enough? - It's not her, it's me! Not enough!

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:58.946
A million dollars to carve up my daughter?

00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:04.986
Eun Oh is in perfect health.

00:21:05.216 --> 00:21:08.656
I'm not asking for her life, am I? Or for years to be taken from it?

00:21:08.986 --> 00:21:11.255
I prepared it to thank you for raising her.

00:21:11.256 --> 00:21:12.256
And you're throwing it back at me?

00:21:12.726 --> 00:21:16.236
If you don't take this, you prove you're just her adoptive mom.

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:21.106
If you really loved her, would you make her share your room?

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:25.136
You should swallow your pride and choose what's best for everyone.

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:27.676
Thank you.

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:30.676
For making Eun Oh finally see you for who you are.

00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:35.016
If you'd been a little less brazen and sly,

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.486
Eun Oh might have actually been fooled.

00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:39.726
Excuse me?

00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:42.826
If you mess with my Gang Oh or show up near my restaurant again,

00:21:43.096 --> 00:21:45.626
I'm going to protest with a picket sign right out front.

00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:50.596
I'll say the mom who left her child is back to steal her liver.

00:21:50.996 --> 00:21:53.166
I'll be here every single day.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.776
- You can't be serious. - My goodness.

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:02.916
We're both mothers with sons.

00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:05.816
Honestly, you're so cruel.

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:11.716
If that's how you feel, you shouldn't have abandoned her.

00:22:12.656 --> 00:22:14.526
When I first saw Eun Oh at the orphanage,

00:22:15.286 --> 00:22:17.256
she was standing in the cold shade of a tree,

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:20.326
and do you have any idea how sad her eyes were?

00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.296
But of course, you wouldn't know.

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:37.916
Darn it!

00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:49.596
(Shoealls)

00:22:55.366 --> 00:22:58.496
These days, young people want comfortable shoes too.

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:03.606
But they won't sacrifice style. So, for any occasion,

00:23:03.676 --> 00:23:05.676
they need a shoe that naturally completes their look.

00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:10.676
We also focused on the materials to create a luxurious feel.

00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:12.076
And, of course,

00:23:12.316 --> 00:23:16.116
we focused on our greatest strength, our superior technology.

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:18.086
Now, take a look.

00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:32.796
- The press seems to like it. - This season is on another level.

00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:37.606
This new product line is simple, yet it makes a powerful statement.

00:23:39.176 --> 00:23:43.216
This right here, our vision of the ideal product.

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:57.956
One, two, three! Pose to the left.

00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:01.126
Pose to the right.

00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:06.236
All right, that's all for today. Great work, everyone.

00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:07.806
Thank you.

00:24:08.266 --> 00:24:11.436
Grandma! You were so amazing, seriously.

00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:13.946
It felt like I barely walked, and now it's over.

00:24:14.046 --> 00:24:15.975
You've improved so much in just a few days.

00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:17.516
That's so nice to hear.

00:24:18.216 --> 00:24:19.216
Ms. Jo.

00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:20.985
The VP of the Senior Model Association...

00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:22.186
is waiting for you.

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:24.416
She's really here?

00:24:27.386 --> 00:24:30.426
Me? Model in a fashion show?

00:24:30.496 --> 00:24:35.396
Yes. The high-end senior-wear designer, Gu Ja Gyeong,

00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:37.036
is putting on a fashion show.

00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:40.936
I thought of you and put you on the list of potential models,

00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:43.736
and you were chosen right away. In this collection,

00:24:43.806 --> 00:24:46.036
there's an outfit that they say is a perfect fit for you.

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:48.276
Me?

00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:51.276
So you're saying...

00:24:52.216 --> 00:24:54.246
you're officially asking me to be a model?

00:24:56.386 --> 00:25:00.956
That's wonderful, but I have no runway experience.

00:25:01.686 --> 00:25:05.996
Senior shows are more relaxed. If you say yes,

00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:09.496
I'll ask the instructor here for special 1-on-1 training.

00:25:10.066 --> 00:25:11.466
Say yes, Grandma!

00:25:14.136 --> 00:25:16.536
I'll do it. I'll give it a try.

00:25:17.006 --> 00:25:20.006
The reason I'm taking these classes is to be on a stage.

00:25:20.676 --> 00:25:23.916
I can't just pass up an opportunity that fell right into my lap.

00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:25.316
I'm doing it.

00:25:25.846 --> 00:25:27.646
- Let's do this! - Yes!

00:25:27.716 --> 00:25:30.656
- Let's do it! - Let's go! This is great!

00:25:30.756 --> 00:25:31.986
(Jamun Medical Devices)

00:25:34.986 --> 00:25:37.756
Mother! What brings you here?

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:41.096
I thought you were getting off work, so I came to go home with you.

00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:42.826
And I have something to tell you.

00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:48.236
Well, I'm not off yet. Since you're here, try this.

00:25:50.406 --> 00:25:52.376
So this is the one.

00:25:53.306 --> 00:25:56.746
You kept raving about this at home. I'd only seen it in pictures.

00:26:00.316 --> 00:26:02.886
But why are you keeping it a secret from the rest of the family?

00:26:03.216 --> 00:26:06.926
We should all go to the fashion show with bouquets to cheer you on.

00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:09.996
Gosh, that's exactly why it's a secret.

00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:12.256
If the whole family shows up to watch,

00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:15.496
I'll be too nervous to walk straight.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:21.006
And if I trip while I'm walking, it's game over, right?

00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:24.736
Just you and Su Bin keep this between us, all right?

00:26:25.906 --> 00:26:29.606
All right. But promise you'll invite us next time.

00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:32.376
All right, deal.

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:34.286
Oh, my.

00:26:35.046 --> 00:26:38.586
I guess it's from using muscles I don't normally use. I was so sore.

00:26:39.186 --> 00:26:41.956
But this feels so refreshing.

00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:44.626
I feel light as a feather.

00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:49.836
- This feels great. - Right? Come by when you're sore.

00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:01.876
Seong Jae, wasn't today your product launch?

00:27:01.946 --> 00:27:04.916
I heard you pulled all-nighters. Shouldn't you be resting at home?

00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:09.646
The launch ended, so I came over. Did you film Grandma today?

00:27:11.116 --> 00:27:12.116
Yes.

00:27:12.786 --> 00:27:15.726
I'm even editing Grandma's challenge vlog myself,

00:27:15.786 --> 00:27:17.796
and my eyes are seriously killing me.

00:27:18.726 --> 00:27:20.066
You sound exhausted.

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:21.566
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you to come out.

00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:23.266
No, it's fine.

00:27:36.846 --> 00:27:39.516
I may be exhausted, but I feel fine.

00:27:41.816 --> 00:27:43.186
You have such a sweet way of putting things.

00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:49.826
So, what's with the outfit? Are we going somewhere?

00:27:51.156 --> 00:27:53.096
Did you change after work?

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:54.426
What?

00:27:58.166 --> 00:28:01.036
I was in a suit all day, so I just wanted to be comfortable.

00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:05.406
Wait.

00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:10.176
Is this because of what he said before?

00:28:11.976 --> 00:28:14.716
Boyfriend? Why are you going out with some old man?

00:28:18.116 --> 00:28:19.186
What? No.

00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:22.286
Come on. So that's why.

00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:25.996
You know, early on in a relationship,

00:28:26.056 --> 00:28:28.066
it's really important to be honest with each other.

00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:29.466
No, I just...

00:28:35.266 --> 00:28:37.006
I just don't want a pretty girl like you...

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:41.276
to be gossiped about for dating an old guy.

00:28:41.676 --> 00:28:43.746
I don't want your reputation ruined because of me.

00:28:44.046 --> 00:28:45.716
So that's why you've been so self-conscious.

00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:49.786
You don't have to be, you know.

00:28:52.386 --> 00:28:55.026
But I like that you care that much.

00:29:00.326 --> 00:29:01.666
So...

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:06.166
what do you think? Do I look okay?

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:12.106
You definitely look younger. You could pass for my age.

00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:14.906
Oh, stop it. You're just saying that.

00:29:15.676 --> 00:29:16.676
Ready to go?

00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:21.385
- Where to? - Dinner at a spot in Apgujeong.

00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:22.616
I found a nice place.

00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:27.956
Why go to Apgujeong in this traffic? It's cold, and I'm tired.

00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:29.426
Let's just eat and hang out in the car.

00:29:30.356 --> 00:29:32.696
You want to eat and hang out in the car?

00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:41.866
- Hey. - Yes?

00:29:46.946 --> 00:29:47.946
Thanks.

00:29:51.876 --> 00:29:52.946
Let's see.

00:29:58.716 --> 00:30:00.986
This one might look good too.

00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:09.726
Oh, hey. This would look really good on you.

00:30:10.866 --> 00:30:11.966
What do you think?

00:30:12.966 --> 00:30:13.966
What?

00:30:16.566 --> 00:30:18.476
Were you looking at me instead of the clothes?

00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:22.406
Was I?

00:30:23.676 --> 00:30:24.946
I like this one.

00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:27.946
You do? Let's get it.

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:30.656
Okay, got it.

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:39.226
And...

00:30:39.926 --> 00:30:41.626
what else should we get?

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:44.466
Should we...

00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:46.966
get matching gloves?

00:30:52.736 --> 00:30:55.046
What if Ji Hyuk finds out?

00:30:56.246 --> 00:31:00.586
You're so naive. You only wear them when we're together.

00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:02.016
Right?

00:31:25.436 --> 00:31:28.246
I'm going to step out for a second. My shoulders are stiff.

00:31:43.656 --> 00:31:45.156
That guy, honestly.

00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:52.566
All right, thank you.

00:31:52.636 --> 00:31:54.906
- Thank you. Here are the keys. - Thanks.

00:31:54.966 --> 00:31:56.466
- Good night, sir. - You too.

00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:01.746
(New Driver Request: Hoeyeon-dong)

00:32:01.976 --> 00:32:03.916
What? Hoeyeon-dong...

00:32:04.546 --> 00:32:05.646
Wait, isn't that my neighbourhood?

00:32:06.016 --> 00:32:11.186
(CEO's Office)

00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:23.866
Excuse me. I'm the designated driver.

00:32:24.436 --> 00:32:26.066
That'll be 765 dollars.

00:32:27.706 --> 00:32:31.606
What took you so long? I called ages ago.

00:32:33.806 --> 00:32:35.276
- Here. - Thank you.

00:32:39.216 --> 00:32:41.886
Mister! Hey, you didn't turn on the GPS?

00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:43.346
Right.

00:32:43.786 --> 00:32:46.286
The villa you're going to is in my neighbourhood, sir.

00:32:46.556 --> 00:32:47.956
I guess it's my lucky day.

00:32:48.256 --> 00:32:49.686
- Really? - Yes.

00:32:49.756 --> 00:32:53.126
- So, where do you live? - Over in the residential area.

00:32:53.466 --> 00:32:54.996
Do you own or rent?

00:32:55.896 --> 00:32:58.296
It's the bank's house, really.

00:32:59.336 --> 00:33:03.406
Still, you're a homeowner. You're better off than me.

00:33:03.536 --> 00:33:06.706
In that case, let's knock five dollars off.

00:33:07.906 --> 00:33:10.546
What? Come on, you can't be serious.

00:33:10.746 --> 00:33:14.016
- Sir, you can't do that. - What are you talking about?

00:33:14.086 --> 00:33:15.086
Dad?

00:33:15.616 --> 00:33:18.286
Come on, you were thrilled it was your neighbourhood.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.286
You even said you could clock out after this.

00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:23.796
Thanks to me, you're getting a free ride home,

00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:26.696
so you can't give me a discount for saving you the trip?

00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:29.966
Sir, you just spent 700 dollars at the bar.

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:32.866
You're asking me for five dollars? That's not right.

00:33:32.896 --> 00:33:37.536
This guy. Can't you take a joke?

00:33:38.036 --> 00:33:41.476
Okay. If it was a joke, then give me another five dollars.

00:33:42.376 --> 00:33:44.016
Dad's been working as a designated driver?

00:33:46.776 --> 00:33:49.016
- Here, five dollars. Hey! - Okay.

00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:51.456
Aren't you going to thank me?

00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:56.786
You're supposed to say, "Thank you." This guy.

00:33:56.856 --> 00:33:58.956
When you gave me the 20 dollars earlier, I said...

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:03.796
- Fine. Thank you. - Whatever. Here.

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.536
- Right. - Darn it.

00:34:06.296 --> 00:34:08.106
- That jerk... - Here.

00:34:12.076 --> 00:34:16.176
What's all the noise? That kid's wasted.

00:34:21.086 --> 00:34:23.216
What a pathetic loser.

00:34:29.656 --> 00:34:30.796
Hey, honey.

00:34:32.026 --> 00:34:33.226
What? The trunk?

00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:37.136
I don't know. I'm home now. It's not here.

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:41.836
Not here. I'm coming! I got it! Darn it.

00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:47.646
What's your problem? Jerk!

00:34:48.006 --> 00:34:50.216
- "Jerk?" - Darn...

00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:51.946
Are you blind?

00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:55.786
Why the heck did you bump into me? Darn it.

00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:57.616
Here. For a pain-relief patch.

00:34:58.916 --> 00:34:59.916
Five dollars?

00:35:00.826 --> 00:35:03.926
You push me and pull this stunt? You little jerk!

00:35:05.626 --> 00:35:07.966
- Throwing punches now? - Darn it...

00:35:12.966 --> 00:35:13.966
You want to keep this up?

00:35:14.836 --> 00:35:19.106
- No, I don't. - And I'm even offering to pay.

00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:21.706
Here. Five dollars.

00:35:22.006 --> 00:35:24.916
- I'm fine. - I'm not fine.

00:35:25.446 --> 00:35:28.416
- Pick it up. Aren't you going to? - I'm really fine.

00:35:28.586 --> 00:35:30.416
Why are you fine? Is five dollars not money to you?

00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:31.556
Hold on.

00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:37.496
Here.

00:35:41.096 --> 00:35:42.296
Who do you think you're messing with?

00:35:48.936 --> 00:35:49.936
Five dollars...

00:35:50.576 --> 00:35:51.576
You punk!

00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:55.506
Still, I made 100 dollars today.

00:35:58.046 --> 00:36:00.716
- I hope you enjoyed your meal. - Yes, thank you. It was delicious.

00:36:00.816 --> 00:36:03.216
- Thank you so much. - Thank you. Have a good one.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:04.286
Sang Cheol!

00:36:04.886 --> 00:36:07.286
Were you just waiting for me to show up?

00:36:07.656 --> 00:36:09.686
Did you make some money tonight? Come on, buy a drink before you go.

00:36:09.756 --> 00:36:11.726
- No, I can't. - Come on, just one drink.

00:36:11.796 --> 00:36:12.796
This guy.

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:18.236
I'll buy the beer, okay? I can't stop thinking of Byeong Ho.

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:20.266
You think this is about the money?

00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:23.566
I can't get Byeong Ho out of my head either.

00:36:24.206 --> 00:36:26.306
If you and I start drinking together on a night like this,

00:36:26.606 --> 00:36:29.646
- we'll get in trouble. We can't. - Just one bottle each, okay?

00:36:29.746 --> 00:36:30.746
Mr. Kim!

00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:36.246
- I'll have a beer, too. - Ji Hyuk! It's been a while.

00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:39.116
All right, sure.

00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:43.386
What are you doing here?

00:36:43.826 --> 00:36:46.696
What? Can't you stand the sight of me?

00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:48.196
Who said I couldn't stand the sight of you?

00:36:49.066 --> 00:36:50.866
You're always jumping to conclusions.

00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:53.196
Good, if that's not the case.

00:36:53.636 --> 00:36:54.836
You just surprised me. That's all.

00:36:55.406 --> 00:36:57.336
You've never come to Yeong Bo's diner alone.

00:36:57.906 --> 00:37:00.106
Wow. Having Ji Hyuk here...

00:37:00.706 --> 00:37:03.106
really brightens up the place.

00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:05.076
It's been a long day at work.

00:37:05.816 --> 00:37:07.746
I was just going to grab a few beers to drink at home,

00:37:07.816 --> 00:37:09.486
but I saw my dad walk in, so I came in too.

00:37:09.546 --> 00:37:13.116
Of course. You carry a huge company on your shoulders.

00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:14.626
How could you not be exhausted? Right?

00:37:15.356 --> 00:37:18.126
Taking care of a family is tough enough.

00:37:18.756 --> 00:37:20.666
It's not like running a company is any easier.

00:37:20.796 --> 00:37:23.696
That's right. You've got to give it your all, Ji Hyuk.

00:37:24.336 --> 00:37:26.866
I was a real hotshot back at the brokerage firm.

00:37:27.336 --> 00:37:28.336
Right? But then...

00:37:28.736 --> 00:37:31.906
I quit, thinking I'd make a killing as a full-time investor.

00:37:32.406 --> 00:37:33.606
And you know what? I lost everything.

00:37:34.946 --> 00:37:37.146
So you've got to keep your head on straight, okay?

00:37:37.816 --> 00:37:39.216
Really? I didn't know that.

00:37:39.376 --> 00:37:42.846
Stop the nonsense. Kids these days can figure things out themselves.

00:37:45.256 --> 00:37:46.256
Come on, drink up.

00:37:48.486 --> 00:37:52.226
The kid's got enough on his plate, and this guy's nagging him.

00:37:52.856 --> 00:37:53.866
Putting all that pressure on him.

00:37:57.466 --> 00:37:58.536
Here, let me get that for you.

00:38:09.076 --> 00:38:10.076
Dad.

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:22.726
Oh, that hits the spot.

00:38:48.386 --> 00:38:50.756
You've got an early start tomorrow. We should get going.

00:38:51.756 --> 00:38:54.056
Okay. Dad, I'll get this.

00:38:54.126 --> 00:38:56.426
No, leave it. I'll pay. Hey, I earn money too, kid.

00:39:11.676 --> 00:39:13.136
- Hey, Yeong Bo. - What?

00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:14.206
We'll settle up.

00:39:15.106 --> 00:39:18.446
- Hey, I said I was getting this. - Come on. Just let me pay.

00:39:18.816 --> 00:39:20.116
Gosh, this guy.

00:39:28.356 --> 00:39:31.095
I'm going to protest with a picket sign right out front.

00:39:31.096 --> 00:39:35.466
I'll say the mom who left her child is back to steal her liver.

00:39:35.766 --> 00:39:37.096
The surgery is in ten days.

00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:38.866
If you don't do this for him,

00:39:39.236 --> 00:39:40.366
your brother is going to die.

00:39:40.736 --> 00:39:44.176
- He is absolutely going to die. - If he dies,

00:39:44.476 --> 00:39:46.776
it's because you're his mother.

00:39:49.806 --> 00:39:50.816
That little witch.

00:39:51.746 --> 00:39:53.376
Am I supposed to just let Woo Jin die?

00:39:54.586 --> 00:39:55.816
But he really could die.

00:39:57.016 --> 00:40:00.116
With so little time left, this is truly a miracle.

00:40:00.786 --> 00:40:02.426
You found your long-lost daughter.

00:40:02.986 --> 00:40:06.826
Oh, no. If Woo Jin really dies, what am I going to do?

00:40:08.566 --> 00:40:09.866
What is all this I'm hearing?

00:40:10.836 --> 00:40:11.936
What do you mean, Woo Jin is dead?

00:40:12.836 --> 00:40:14.065
You lied to me while he was dying...

00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:15.336
because he needed a liver transplant?

00:40:15.866 --> 00:40:16.936
You lied to me!

00:40:18.176 --> 00:40:19.306
What was your motive?

00:40:20.036 --> 00:40:21.046
Hey, Ko Seong Hui.

00:40:21.876 --> 00:40:24.016
How could you do something like that as his mother?

00:40:26.276 --> 00:40:28.186
I don't even know who you are anymore.

00:40:29.316 --> 00:40:31.816
What are you going to do? Woo Jin is dead!

00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:50.336
No, that can't happen.

00:40:51.036 --> 00:40:52.176
If Woo Jin dies,

00:40:53.536 --> 00:40:55.076
I'll have nowhere to run.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:41:00.476
I'll be trapped like a rat in a cage with Park Jin Seok.

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:04.086
I can't let that happen.

00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:20.736
Honey, what should I wear?

00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:22.706
What are you up to?

00:41:24.376 --> 00:41:27.646
I was thinking of wearing the watch we bought in Rome.

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:30.676
- I have my book club today. - Right.

00:41:32.876 --> 00:41:33.876
One stack each.

00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:35.586
You really never change.

00:41:36.186 --> 00:41:38.756
Rather modest for a chairman's wife, don't you think?

00:41:39.316 --> 00:41:44.196
Excuse me? I have buildings, apartments, jewellery, and cash.

00:41:44.326 --> 00:41:45.426
I've got it all in here.

00:41:48.426 --> 00:41:51.296
I'll have to get you a gold bar. I don't see any in here.

00:41:52.736 --> 00:41:54.606
What would I even do with a gold bar?

00:41:58.106 --> 00:42:00.606
- Honey, have a good day at work. - Okay.

00:42:23.696 --> 00:42:24.766
We'll see about that.

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:43.246
(Property Title Deed, Owner: Ko Seong Hui)

00:42:47.486 --> 00:42:49.356
After everything she's done to me,

00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:52.126
she has no maternal instincts whatsoever.

00:42:52.456 --> 00:42:54.696
Maternal instinct? Forget that. The woman has no humanity.

00:43:00.196 --> 00:43:01.506
Hey, it's okay.

00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:03.566
Come and join us.

00:43:06.206 --> 00:43:07.776
Eun Oh's a little conflicted, Ji Hyuk.

00:43:08.706 --> 00:43:11.416
The way she treated Eun Oh was subhuman,

00:43:11.616 --> 00:43:14.416
but she got her son surgery for an ear infection and raised him,

00:43:14.786 --> 00:43:17.986
and she's now doing the impossible to get him a liver transplant.

00:43:18.786 --> 00:43:19.856
So of course, you're confused.

00:43:23.026 --> 00:43:24.026
I can see why you'd be confused.

00:43:24.696 --> 00:43:25.696
But...

00:43:26.556 --> 00:43:27.566
Don't let it get to you.

00:43:29.366 --> 00:43:30.366
It's not like that.

00:43:32.096 --> 00:43:33.266
Hold on a second.

00:43:36.036 --> 00:43:37.036
Hello?

00:43:38.576 --> 00:43:39.576
Yes.

00:43:39.836 --> 00:43:41.406
Yes, this is the turnkey team manager.

00:43:43.706 --> 00:43:46.346
You want to commission us for the entire building?

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:49.146
Yes. It's across from the Dosan Park.

00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:53.956
I see. When would you like to meet?

00:43:56.226 --> 00:43:57.726
You mean today?

00:43:58.726 --> 00:44:00.456
What? You're going to a meeting right now?

00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:04.736
I think I can be there by 2pm.

00:44:05.696 --> 00:44:08.266
Great, I'll see you then. Okay.

00:44:10.806 --> 00:44:12.206
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:44:12.936 --> 00:44:14.476
Why is a team manager going to the initial meeting?

00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:16.876
It's a complete remodel of a four-story building.

00:44:17.106 --> 00:44:20.916
Would you entrust a project of that scale...

00:44:20.986 --> 00:44:21.986
to a designer you haven't even met?

00:44:22.646 --> 00:44:24.416
Wait, you agreed to meet at the site?

00:44:24.786 --> 00:44:26.416
Yes. I'll be right back.

00:44:27.686 --> 00:44:28.686
Wait.

00:44:37.636 --> 00:44:39.166
The whole building?

00:44:43.766 --> 00:44:44.776
Nice.

00:44:49.306 --> 00:44:50.406
Welcome.

00:44:52.076 --> 00:44:55.446
I'm meeting someone. I'll order when they get here.

00:44:56.316 --> 00:44:58.316
They're already waiting for you over there.

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:18.806
They locked the door from the outside.

00:45:19.576 --> 00:45:20.576
You can't get out.

00:45:30.486 --> 00:45:31.816
What do you think you're doing?

00:45:33.956 --> 00:45:34.956
Sit down.

00:45:36.486 --> 00:45:37.856
You just never quit.

00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:41.166
I can't give up, so no, it won't end.

00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:44.636
Not until one of us is dead.

00:45:45.866 --> 00:45:48.636
She really loves her son this much?

00:45:56.946 --> 00:45:57.946
In that case...

00:45:59.146 --> 00:46:00.816
Let me ask you something first.

00:46:04.716 --> 00:46:06.586
Why did you raise your son?

00:46:07.856 --> 00:46:09.626
Why did you only take him?

00:46:10.486 --> 00:46:11.996
And you even left your ID behind.

00:46:13.856 --> 00:46:15.366
I suppose you would be curious about that.

00:46:17.226 --> 00:46:18.236
Answer me.

00:46:24.536 --> 00:46:25.536
Well...

00:46:30.106 --> 00:46:33.546
(November 1996)

00:46:34.346 --> 00:46:37.986
Oh dear. If Woo Jin's ear infections keep recurring,

00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:40.056
it might be better to just go ahead with the surgery.

00:46:40.116 --> 00:46:44.296
- I'll have to ask their dad. - But wait, Seong Hui.

00:46:45.326 --> 00:46:47.456
Why do you always bring the twins in by yourself?

00:46:47.826 --> 00:46:48.966
You should come with their dad.

00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:52.496
You know how busy he is with his business.

00:46:52.996 --> 00:46:55.835
- We haven't eaten together in ages. - Mom.

00:46:55.836 --> 00:46:58.406
Leaving a beautiful wife like you alone all the time...

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:00.506
That's a risky move.

00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:04.376
Oh, please. If I'm what you call risky,

00:47:04.716 --> 00:47:07.816
then your wife would probably make you close up shop.

00:47:08.416 --> 00:47:10.746
I'm not married.

00:47:11.316 --> 00:47:12.656
Do I look like I'm married?

00:47:15.026 --> 00:47:16.026
I need to take better care of myself.

00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:20.326
- So he really is single. - Mom.

00:47:20.556 --> 00:47:22.496
- Right this way. - Thank you.

00:47:22.566 --> 00:47:24.666
(Winter, 1998)

00:47:30.936 --> 00:47:33.506
Mr. Park Jin Seok is handsome, isn't he?

00:47:35.046 --> 00:47:36.276
So what if he's handsome?

00:47:38.976 --> 00:47:42.916
Are there any decent single guys among our regulars?

00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:47.186
And don't any of you get ideas just because Mr. Park is single.

00:47:47.586 --> 00:47:50.726
He got cheated on by his wife, so he won't even look at women.

00:47:54.626 --> 00:47:56.426
I hope you enjoyed the meal.

00:47:56.566 --> 00:47:58.596
- That was a wonderful meal. - Good.

00:47:58.996 --> 00:48:00.766
- Yes. - I hope you enjoyed everything.

00:48:00.796 --> 00:48:01.806
Yes.

00:48:03.736 --> 00:48:05.735
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:48:05.736 --> 00:48:06.806
Keep the change.

00:48:08.076 --> 00:48:09.576
- Shall we? - Yes, let's go.

00:48:24.956 --> 00:48:27.396
Ms. Ko, this is Dr. Kang.

00:48:27.766 --> 00:48:30.296
I heard your husband passed away, and you moved.

00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:33.766
I was just calling to see if Woo Jin ever had his surgery.

00:48:34.336 --> 00:48:35.736
It's been on my mind.

00:48:36.336 --> 00:48:37.706
And with your husband gone,

00:48:38.106 --> 00:48:40.506
I've been worried about how you're getting by on your own.

00:48:49.016 --> 00:48:52.456
Hold on. Wait, Woo Jin. Here, Yu Ra.

00:48:53.056 --> 00:48:57.586
If you eat this banana and wait, I promise I'll be back with more.

00:48:57.856 --> 00:48:59.596
Let's go. Up you go.

00:48:59.856 --> 00:49:03.566
- Yu Ra! - Brother!

00:49:04.566 --> 00:49:05.996
I've been worried about you too, Seong Hui.

00:49:06.836 --> 00:49:09.266
I'll operate on Woo Jin myself.

00:49:11.136 --> 00:49:13.106
Wait! Please, just a second!

00:49:13.636 --> 00:49:14.706
Gosh, that crazy jerk.

00:49:15.446 --> 00:49:18.646
My son is sick! We have to get to the hospital!

00:49:19.276 --> 00:49:23.446
I can't be late. Gosh, I can't miss this opportunity.

00:49:29.626 --> 00:49:31.526
(Yongjin Hospital)

00:49:31.626 --> 00:49:32.626
Thank you so much.

00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:39.536
(Operating Room)

00:49:39.596 --> 00:49:40.696
The surgery was a success.

00:49:40.966 --> 00:49:42.866
He won't suffer from ear infections anymore.

00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:48.376
- Thank you so much, Doctor. - You look completely worn out.

00:49:50.246 --> 00:49:52.576
It's just so hard getting through each day.

00:49:53.446 --> 00:49:54.546
I can only imagine.

00:49:54.986 --> 00:49:56.216
You mentioned you don't have any family...

00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.416
around here, right?

00:50:01.986 --> 00:50:04.496
But with you helping Woo Jin like this,

00:50:05.096 --> 00:50:06.656
it feels like I have family again.

00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:11.436
It's not much,

00:50:11.966 --> 00:50:13.796
but I'd like to cook a meal for you.

00:50:14.506 --> 00:50:16.066
I'm sure you miss home-cooked food.

00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:18.836
I'll have home-cooked meals every day now.

00:50:19.276 --> 00:50:21.446
I went on a blind date recently, and I'm getting married next month.

00:50:22.406 --> 00:50:23.406
What?

00:50:23.976 --> 00:50:25.246
You're getting married?

00:50:25.546 --> 00:50:27.116
I've decided to open my own practice in Daegu.

00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:30.146
My fiancee's family is from Daegu. That's why I called.

00:50:30.416 --> 00:50:31.716
I just couldn't stop thinking about Woo Jin.

00:50:34.086 --> 00:50:37.126
In that case, you shouldn't have called at all.

00:50:37.386 --> 00:50:40.095
Come on, I've been treating Woo Jin and Yu Ra...

00:50:40.096 --> 00:50:41.396
for three years now.

00:50:49.106 --> 00:50:51.776
It was like fishing for minnows and catching a whale.

00:50:54.436 --> 00:50:55.646
You don't want to answer me?

00:51:02.116 --> 00:51:03.686
You have to hear my answer first.

00:51:04.316 --> 00:51:05.356
You said you were curious, didn't you?

00:51:13.896 --> 00:51:14.966
Then answer me.

00:51:15.596 --> 00:51:16.766
Why did you choose...

00:51:17.466 --> 00:51:18.566
to raise your son?

00:51:20.566 --> 00:51:21.936
I needed something.

00:51:23.536 --> 00:51:24.536
And?

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:26.176
What was it?

00:51:30.176 --> 00:51:31.345
(Property Title Deed, Owner: Ko Seong Hui)

00:51:31.346 --> 00:51:32.846
It's the deed to this building.

00:51:33.576 --> 00:51:35.186
It's worth ten million dollars, even in a quick sale.

00:51:35.646 --> 00:51:39.686
The gift tax is 4.99 million, including the 10 percent local tax.

00:51:40.756 --> 00:51:44.256
Since you can't afford the gift tax, I'll give you that money, too.

00:51:45.026 --> 00:51:46.926
That's 2.274 million dollars.

00:51:48.566 --> 00:51:50.696
What is this?

00:51:57.066 --> 00:51:59.506
Here, 7.25 million dollars.

00:51:59.906 --> 00:52:01.106
Use this to pay the gift tax.

00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:04.206
Let's go sign the gift contract right now.

00:52:04.506 --> 00:52:06.846
I'll transfer the deed and give you this check today.

00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:13.716
Are you telling me...

00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:16.186
to sell you my liver?

00:52:17.886 --> 00:52:22.196
You refuse to give me what I'm owed, so I have to buy it instead.

00:52:23.326 --> 00:52:25.236
You seem to really care about your adoptive mom.

00:52:25.596 --> 00:52:28.166
Are you going to make her live in a rental forever?

00:52:28.906 --> 00:52:32.606
Donating your liver is simple. You're perfectly healthy.

00:52:33.836 --> 00:52:35.606
So you save my son,

00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:38.146
and I'll set your family up for life.

00:52:38.976 --> 00:52:39.976
Deal?

00:52:40.246 --> 00:52:41.586
Are you even human?

00:52:42.416 --> 00:52:45.086
Do you have any humanity at all?

00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:47.486
How can you be so completely...

00:52:48.056 --> 00:52:49.886
shameless and feel no remorse?

00:52:53.126 --> 00:52:57.026
I'm offering you life-changing money for your precious mom and brother.

00:52:57.396 --> 00:52:59.536
Money you couldn't have dreamed of in a million years.

00:52:59.796 --> 00:53:03.266
Do you realise how much I'm offering for a tiny piece of your liver?

00:53:04.436 --> 00:53:08.746
I offered 17.25 million dollars in total.

00:53:12.316 --> 00:53:14.786
So this is who you really are.

00:53:16.486 --> 00:53:18.056
Everything I saw before was just an act.

00:53:20.886 --> 00:53:22.686
Does anyone really have a "true self?"

00:53:26.896 --> 00:53:29.726
So you thought I was nice when you first met me.

00:53:31.536 --> 00:53:32.536
Eun Oh.

00:53:33.036 --> 00:53:35.266
People are like mollusks.

00:53:35.906 --> 00:53:37.466
There's nothing set in stone for people.

00:53:37.936 --> 00:53:39.676
A heart, a personality...

00:53:40.206 --> 00:53:41.576
Things like that don't exist.

00:53:42.606 --> 00:53:44.046
Just look at you.

00:53:45.116 --> 00:53:49.546
You'd let your brother die, yet you dare get angry at me.

00:53:49.786 --> 00:53:51.246
That's evil.

00:53:52.286 --> 00:53:54.826
Who are you to call me a bad person?

00:53:56.156 --> 00:53:59.326
This is why I can't stand people who aren't honest with themselves.

00:54:01.866 --> 00:54:03.826
That twisted logic of yours won't work on me.

00:54:05.366 --> 00:54:06.396
No, wait.

00:54:06.996 --> 00:54:08.706
You actually believe that, don't you?

00:54:09.536 --> 00:54:13.336
Enough of this pointless chatter. Let's go to the lawyer's office.

00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:16.946
Do you really think I'm going to accept this?

00:54:19.546 --> 00:54:21.276
Just because the building is worth ten million dollars?

00:54:22.616 --> 00:54:23.816
So you're refusing my offer?

00:54:25.756 --> 00:54:26.786
I'm not taking it.

00:54:29.656 --> 00:54:32.056
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

00:54:32.626 --> 00:54:34.896
Why not? Because I deceived you?

00:54:35.396 --> 00:54:36.796
So your pride is hurt?

00:54:37.226 --> 00:54:40.366
Is it worth more than this money? What good is your pride, anyway?

00:54:41.136 --> 00:54:43.466
If I offered this to any match from the suitability test,

00:54:43.536 --> 00:54:45.006
people would line up for a mile.

00:54:45.476 --> 00:54:48.676
- You'd throw this away for pride? - No.

00:54:49.006 --> 00:54:53.716
My pride isn't worth this much. And neither is my liver.

00:54:54.316 --> 00:54:55.386
My liver...

00:54:57.086 --> 00:55:01.956
If someone said a boy was dying and asked me how much I'd charge,

00:55:02.256 --> 00:55:03.426
maybe I'd ask for 100,000 dollars.

00:55:03.986 --> 00:55:05.456
Or I might even give it for free.

00:55:06.326 --> 00:55:09.526
Do you still think this is about my pride?

00:55:10.396 --> 00:55:14.036
It's not. It's so I can watch you be ruined.

00:55:15.506 --> 00:55:17.805
Losing a multi-million dollar building...

00:55:17.806 --> 00:55:19.836
is a price I'll pay to stop you.

00:55:20.806 --> 00:55:22.576
It's a small price to ruin you, Ko Seong Hui.

00:55:27.976 --> 00:55:31.246
As for me, I can take care of myself just fine.

00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:34.656
Maybe you didn't have the confidence to raise your kids on your own,

00:55:34.716 --> 00:55:37.826
so you needed a rich man, but I'm not like that.

00:55:38.656 --> 00:55:39.726
My mom?

00:55:40.256 --> 00:55:41.926
I'll be the one to provide for her.

00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:43.896
I'll take care of her myself.

00:55:51.906 --> 00:55:53.306
What am I going to do?

00:55:55.876 --> 00:55:58.076
Because he was born to a woman like you,

00:55:59.046 --> 00:56:00.546
my brother...

00:56:01.786 --> 00:56:03.646
is going to die at 31. So that's how it is.

00:56:07.416 --> 00:56:09.826
Eun Oh. Don't.

00:56:10.756 --> 00:56:11.756
Feeling betrayed?

00:56:12.396 --> 00:56:13.926
That's nothing.

00:56:14.426 --> 00:56:16.496
You're just being young and naive.

00:56:17.196 --> 00:56:19.936
Go ask your mom if she's okay with you turning down ten million.

00:56:20.566 --> 00:56:23.035
Tell your brother you turned down ten million...

00:56:23.036 --> 00:56:24.366
to back out of the liver transplant.

00:56:24.706 --> 00:56:26.976
This is ten million dollars, Eun Oh!

00:56:27.506 --> 00:56:29.846
Your brother accepted one million without hesitation.

00:56:31.146 --> 00:56:32.916
You gave my brother money?

00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:35.716
That's not what's important right now.

00:56:37.516 --> 00:56:38.616
Your father...

00:56:39.216 --> 00:56:41.726
He died in a hit-and-run on his way to your first birthday.

00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:44.656
I was only 28.

00:56:45.296 --> 00:56:47.456
If I'd known I'd have twins for him to die in a hit-and-run,

00:56:47.526 --> 00:56:48.796
do you really think I would have married him?

00:56:49.626 --> 00:56:52.166
The lengths I went to just to raise one of you...

00:56:52.336 --> 00:56:54.166
You have no idea. You don't know anything.

00:56:55.606 --> 00:56:58.876
Please, let's just be realistic about this.

00:56:59.606 --> 00:57:01.476
Tell whoever locked this door to open it.

00:57:01.906 --> 00:57:03.176
Before I break it down myself.

00:57:08.986 --> 00:57:10.346
You really are a piece of work.

00:57:13.286 --> 00:57:14.456
If your brother dies,

00:57:15.186 --> 00:57:16.486
I won't let you get away with it.

00:57:18.396 --> 00:57:19.596
Can you handle the consequences?

00:57:52.296 --> 00:57:53.856
- Mr. Jo. - Yes?

00:57:53.926 --> 00:57:55.696
Is Ms. Ji coming back after closing the deal?

00:57:56.166 --> 00:57:57.266
Haven't you heard from her yet?

00:57:57.566 --> 00:57:58.696
No, not yet.

00:57:59.096 --> 00:58:02.136
It's a full building remodel, so the meeting's running long.

00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:05.106
(AP Group)

00:58:06.736 --> 00:58:08.746
(AP Group)

00:58:13.076 --> 00:58:15.086
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:58:20.616 --> 00:58:22.026
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:58:22.656 --> 00:58:24.126
It wasn't a client.

00:58:24.926 --> 00:58:25.996
It was her.

00:58:28.226 --> 00:58:30.926
- So she was just luring me out. - It was her?

00:58:31.566 --> 00:58:33.166
That woman is completely insane.

00:58:33.766 --> 00:58:36.036
This isn't the first time she's posed as a client.

00:58:36.736 --> 00:58:38.506
That's it. Give me her number.

00:58:39.136 --> 00:58:41.776
- Ji Hyuk. - I'll find her and end this.

00:58:42.946 --> 00:58:46.316
- This is my fight. - I thought we were a team.

00:58:47.176 --> 00:58:48.586
Can't I be the one to look out for you?

00:58:49.246 --> 00:58:51.856
Watching you deal with that monster all by yourself...

00:58:52.316 --> 00:58:53.416
I can't stand it anymore.

00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:58.396
You're already a great mentor to me.

00:58:59.026 --> 00:59:01.226
You've already done so much for me, and you continue to do so.

00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:03.496
But this...

00:59:04.426 --> 00:59:08.066
This is my cross to bear for being her daughter.

00:59:10.036 --> 00:59:11.536
If I need your help in the future,

00:59:12.076 --> 00:59:13.736
I promise I'll be the one to ask.

00:59:17.546 --> 00:59:20.016
I'm still going to check in on you, though.

00:59:22.386 --> 00:59:23.816
I won't hide anything from you.

00:59:25.886 --> 00:59:27.916
All right. I understand.

00:59:37.726 --> 00:59:38.796
Why did you call me here?

00:59:39.766 --> 00:59:41.736
I said I'd be here tomorrow. Why did you insist I come today?

00:59:44.806 --> 00:59:46.536
Because I want to see Yu Ra now.

00:59:49.006 --> 00:59:50.376
I'm her older brother.

00:59:51.746 --> 00:59:53.046
And I need to thank her.

00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:58.246
Can't you wait until after your surgery for that?

00:59:59.186 --> 01:00:01.016
What does that matter?

01:00:01.686 --> 01:00:04.026
You've gone decades without even knowing she existed.

01:00:06.956 --> 01:00:10.796
You won't let me and Yu Ra meet, even after the surgery.

01:00:11.766 --> 01:00:12.996
You're just using her for the liver transplant.

01:00:14.266 --> 01:00:16.736
- How could you do that? - For me...

01:00:17.436 --> 01:00:18.736
As long as you live, that's all that matters.

01:00:19.976 --> 01:00:23.376
She doesn't even remember you. You have no feelings for her, right?

01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:28.276
You're unbelievable, Mom.

01:00:28.846 --> 01:00:30.086
You're not human.

01:00:31.316 --> 01:00:33.156
If you really do that, I won't let it slide.

01:00:33.756 --> 01:00:36.226
My gosh. This is ridiculous.

01:00:39.496 --> 01:00:40.526
After the surgery...

01:00:41.996 --> 01:00:43.696
I'm going to tell Father.

01:00:45.436 --> 01:00:47.366
That I got a liver transplant from my twin sister.

01:00:52.006 --> 01:00:54.536
You might as well just stab me, Woo Jin.

01:00:55.746 --> 01:00:58.476
- The carotid artery is right here. - Mom!

01:00:58.546 --> 01:01:00.676
I even hid your transplant surgery, and you're going to tell him?

01:01:01.716 --> 01:01:04.746
If Chairman Park finds out about her, what will he do to me?

01:01:04.946 --> 01:01:07.656
Then I'll lose everything. Because I'll have lost his trust.

01:01:07.716 --> 01:01:08.726
And you'd still tell him?

01:01:11.356 --> 01:01:12.426
Mom,

01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:16.096
It's so unfair to Yu Ra.

01:01:17.426 --> 01:01:20.336
You can ask Father for forgiveness, can't you?

01:01:23.006 --> 01:01:24.836
Mom, if you don't promise me,

01:01:25.606 --> 01:01:28.036
I'm really not getting the liver transplant.

01:01:31.746 --> 01:01:34.176
As a matter of fact, she already refused the transplant.

01:01:36.946 --> 01:01:39.456
If I can't change her mind, you're going to die anyway,

01:01:39.716 --> 01:01:41.756
so don't you dare play games with your life.

01:01:42.026 --> 01:01:43.186
As if you'd actually let yourself die.

01:01:43.626 --> 01:01:46.096
You hear me? She said no!

01:01:46.756 --> 01:01:50.766
She's refusing since I'm the mother you say I am!

01:01:53.896 --> 01:01:55.136
Are you scared now?

01:01:56.006 --> 01:01:57.336
Now, you're scared, aren't you?

01:02:05.976 --> 01:02:07.776
So there is a way.

01:02:10.016 --> 01:02:12.786
Having you beg her yourself, Woo Jin.

01:02:38.176 --> 01:02:39.176
What's this?

01:02:46.516 --> 01:02:48.386
I sent you a heads-up so you wouldn't be scared,

01:02:49.656 --> 01:02:50.926
but here you are, ready for a fight.

01:02:53.026 --> 01:02:54.026
Han Woo Jin?

01:02:55.766 --> 01:02:57.526
Pretty dramatic entrance, right?

01:02:59.596 --> 01:03:00.596
Yes.

01:03:05.776 --> 01:03:07.436
I have a favour to ask you.

01:03:10.646 --> 01:03:11.646
A favour?

01:03:52.016 --> 01:03:54.556
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.956
- I'm sorry I couldn't keep my word. - You're not moving out?

01:03:58.026 --> 01:04:00.895
- I'll move out when I'm married. - Married? What do you mean?

01:04:00.896 --> 01:04:01.966
Are you getting married?

01:04:02.026 --> 01:04:04.566
I want to go visit Woo Jin. I can just wear a disguise.

01:04:04.626 --> 01:04:08.436
The kind of people I hate most are deceivers. Liars.

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:09.936
You lied to me?

01:04:10.166 --> 01:04:13.106
You said your awful birth mother only came for the liver transplant.

01:04:13.176 --> 01:04:15.746
Remember? That's what I'm here to ask for.

01:04:15.846 --> 01:04:17.776
This is the ultimate revenge I can get.

01:04:17.846 --> 01:04:19.245
That crazy brat...

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:21.646
If he dies, I die too, Detective.

01:04:21.776 --> 01:04:23.786
This is the face of your brother you're about to kill.

01:04:23.846 --> 01:04:26.056
I want you to know exactly who you're killing.

01:04:26.186 --> 01:04:27.586
I'm not interested.
