no matter how we call her.

with or without you.

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:22.680

I found the opium without you, didn't I?

I don't feel like it.

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:36.636
Madam Li spent the whole morning

00:03:36.637 --> 00:03:38.077
preparing this meal.

Mrs. Lin, where are you going?

00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:48.911
I'll go with you.

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:50.711
No need.

00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:51.991
Mrs. Lin,

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:53.551
don't make this hard for me.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:58.512
Did your boss tell you to watch me?

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:01.232
Let her go.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.499
Are you sure?

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.740
Follow her.

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:13.712
What are you looking at?

00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:15.752

Go.

00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:21.871
All right, all right.

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:23.192
I'm going.

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:32.671
Madam.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.551
(Let's see
what you're sneaking around for.)

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:36.792
Are the clothes ready?

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:38.232
All done.

00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:40.861
We worked overtime last night.

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:43.061
I followed all the measurements
you gave me.

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:45.299
It'd be more accurate
if the child could come in for sizing.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.951
Please wrap them up for me.

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:47.952
Certainly.

00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:05.799
Madam,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.440
your clothes.

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:13.031
Thank you.

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:14.032
Take care.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:15.271
Don't you have any other methods?

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:16.672
I learned from you.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.720
We agreed not to meddle
in each other's business.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.220
Mr. Lin,
you'd do well to stay in your lane.

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:25.592
My kindness means nothing to you.

00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:27.447
Fine, don't come begging me later.

00:06:36.032 --> 00:06:36.631
Mother,

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.511
I miss you every day.

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:39.191
Guang.

00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:41.631
Can't you visit me more often?

00:06:41.632 --> 00:06:42.907
Be good, Guang.

00:06:43.392 --> 00:06:44.712
I miss you too.

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:50.552
What are you doing?

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:55.192
You always bring useless things.

00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:57.591
Didn't you say you came here

00:06:57.592 --> 00:06:59.311
to sing and earn money?

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:00.432
I think

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:03.312
you found yourself some man out there.

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:07.632
I suppose I've found a way
to get Lu Man to give me the goods.

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:09.791
You wretch!

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.431
Mother...

00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:12.391
Tell me

00:07:12.392 --> 00:07:14.752
how Guang hurt his face.

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:19.436
If I hadn't bought
your freedom back then,

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:22.271
you'd still be pouring drinks for men.

00:07:22.272 --> 00:07:23.791
And now you think

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:25.832
you can lecture me?

00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:27.311
Where's the money?

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:28.792
When will I get my money?

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:30.871
I'm warning you,

00:07:30.872 --> 00:07:32.631
touch one hair on Guang,

00:07:32.632 --> 00:07:34.071
and I'll fight you!

00:07:34.072 --> 00:07:36.511
I'm stuck in this dump every day.

00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:37.991
I'm bored out of my mind.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.952
If you don't bring me money,

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:43.911
I'll take Guang to that lover of yours

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:46.791
and spill everything.

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:47.791
Lu Youcai,

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.511
get this straight.

00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:50.471
All these years,

00:07:50.472 --> 00:07:52.832
I've been the one feeding you.

00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:54.951
So what?

00:07:54.952 --> 00:07:56.951
You really believe you have the right

00:07:56.952 --> 00:07:59.112
to put me in my place?

00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:00.912
Stop!

00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:04.592
Oh, we've got company.

00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:17.677
Xu Yin.

00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:22.232
I never thought you had
this many secrets tucked away.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:25.111
I wonder
if it will be a surprise or a shock

00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:26.711
for Chief Song

00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:28.712
when he hears about this.

00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:32.617
Xu Yin,

00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:34.351
for old times' sake...

00:08:34.352 --> 00:08:35.752
You want me to keep this quiet?

00:08:37.112 --> 00:08:39.072
What's in it for me?

00:08:40.912 --> 00:08:43.312
These.

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:45.711
Ask for whatever you want.

00:08:45.712 --> 00:08:46.991
From now on,

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:49.552
what's mine is yours.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:53.351
You're generous.

00:08:53.352 --> 00:08:54.824
Although,

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:59.145
what's mine has been yours already.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.991
Don't worry.

00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:03.712
I'll never have anything to do

00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:05.697
with Lin Yun again.

00:09:06.632 --> 00:09:08.151
I don't care about that.

00:09:08.152 --> 00:09:09.672
Then what do you want?

00:09:11.312 --> 00:09:12.872
Herbs.

00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:14.431
Herbs?

00:09:14.432 --> 00:09:16.231
The Liang's Apothecary
has plenty of those.

00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:18.631
Tell me what you need.

00:09:18.632 --> 00:09:20.071
I'll fetch it.

00:09:20.072 --> 00:09:21.512
I'm asking for plenty.

00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:23.231
I want

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:25.431
all the wulingzhi I saw

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.232
in those dozen crates.

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.386
Why do you want that?

00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:32.907
No reason.

00:09:32.992 --> 00:09:34.191
I just

00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:35.752
like it.

00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:36.631
What?

00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:37.311
Is that a problem?

00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:38.671
I may be

00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:39.631
the daughter

00:09:39.632 --> 00:09:41.624
of the Liang family,

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:43.911
but ever since I married Song Zhichu,

00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:45.711
he's been

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:47.432
running everything.

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:49.511
It all belongs to him.

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:51.392
I can't make the call.

00:09:53.072 --> 00:09:55.032
Then, I'll go to Chief Song.

00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:57.112
Wait!

00:09:57.632 --> 00:09:59.152
Give me some time.

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:00.832
All right.

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:03.151
But I'm impatient,

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:04.031
and I have loose lips.

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:05.632
I'll be quick about it.

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:22.551
You don't come across

00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:24.512
icy imperial green jadeite every day.

00:10:25.352 --> 00:10:26.991
You don't deserve it.

00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:29.071
It'd be such a waste

00:10:29.072 --> 00:10:30.712
if your lover accidentally smashed it.

00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:32.632
I'll hold on to it for you.

00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:10.871
Yi,

00:11:10.872 --> 00:11:12.072
sit here.

00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:15.231
Is this necessary, Father?

00:11:15.232 --> 00:11:16.351
It's just a gift.

00:11:16.352 --> 00:11:18.232
There's no need for all this secrecy.

00:11:18.872 --> 00:11:22.191
It's for your 18th birthday.

00:11:22.192 --> 00:11:24.472
A bit of ceremony never hurts.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:25.872
Open it.

00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:29.631
Father, I expected

00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:30.711
something exciting.

00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:33.631
This is what people
your age appreciate, not me.

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:35.151
Oh, you.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.391
I chose this icy imperial green jadeite
just for you.

00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:39.871
It took me a long time

00:11:39.872 --> 00:11:41.151
to find it.

00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:44.111
I even had a master craftsman
in Suzhou customize it for you.

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:45.432
Give me your hand.

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:48.831
This jade is firm but not brittle,

00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:50.991
just like my Yi.

00:11:50.992 --> 00:11:54.191
I hope this bangle keeps you safe

00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:56.032
all your life.

00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.551
(I miss you,)

00:12:11.552 --> 00:12:13.712
(Father...)

00:12:47.992 --> 00:12:49.511
The head of the Chengyun Society.

00:12:49.512 --> 00:12:50.752
Hello.

00:12:51.512 --> 00:12:52.632
You're drunk.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.232
No, I'm not.

00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:57.992
I can walk in a straight line.

00:12:59.272 --> 00:13:00.751
I can walk

00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:02.111
sideways

00:13:02.112 --> 00:13:03.592
and backwards too.

00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.271
Stop it.

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:14.511
We're going home.

00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:15.632
Home?

00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:18.992
I don't have a home anymore.

00:13:20.632 --> 00:13:22.072
Not anymore...

00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:32.932
(Puyuan Pastries)

00:13:33.632 --> 00:13:34.872
Smells good.

00:13:35.672 --> 00:13:36.792
I want pastries.

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:41.792
I want pastries.

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:43.871
Smells so good.

00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:46.071
They are my favourite.

00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:49.392
My father always bought me
lots of those pastries.

00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:50.871
I want pastries.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.551
I want pastries.

00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:53.599
It's late.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.991
They're closed.

00:13:54.992 --> 00:13:57.436
No, I want pastries.

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:59.672
I want pastries right now.

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:01.351
I want pastries...

00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:03.231
I want pastries...

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:04.872
I want pastries...

00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:16.192
Coming!

00:14:18.472 --> 00:14:20.112
Mr. Lin?

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:21.551
I'd like to buy some pastries.

00:14:21.552 --> 00:14:23.392
