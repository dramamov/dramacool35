Director.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.670
Now I understand why you didn't let me
bring him.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.760
It's too late to say that now.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.520
Come with me to talk to Chief.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.730
How is he?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.150
How's his condition now?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
He's okay.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.660
His condition is much more stable.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.520
Gao Zhiyao.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.000
Isn't he your good friend?

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.550
How could you not know anything?

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.770
What do you even know?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.790
I had no idea

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.720
he couldn't get over his ex-girlfriend
to that extent.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.590
Chief is here.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
Gao Zhiyao.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.520
It's you again?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.440
Why am I not surprised at all?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.420
Again!

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.200
Chief.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.590
The inmates are trying to rest.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.460
Let's keep our voices down.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.860
Yeah, let's keep it down.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.130
I'm sorry, Chief.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.030
It was my oversight.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660
Of course it was your oversight.
Or was it supposed to be mine?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.530
Chief.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.000
That was an unexpected situation.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.160
He already did his best, alright?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.010
Director Xiao, are you taking his side?

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.880
Fine, if you want to shoulder it—

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.240
all relevant personnel will have
their salaries deducted for 3 months.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.229
But, Chief,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.360
it was an unexpected situation.
This is too harsh.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.820
Once might be considered unexpected,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.330
but how many times
has this happened with Gao Zhiyao?

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.130
He's long been unfit for the job.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.780
Let me ask you.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.810
I've heard he's your friend.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.530
Does being friends mean
you can ignore the rules?

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.030
Are you trying to help him escape,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.150
or do you want to accompany him in jail?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.690
You can do that, you know?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.330
Change your clothes and get in there
to keep him company then!

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.530
Just get in here together then!
Don't you know what time it is?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.690
Starting tomorrow, you're
reassigned to Cell Block Violation.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.420
-If you mess up again, you're out of here!
-Chief.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.320
He still lacks experience, alright?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.820
Lacks experience? No way.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.419
Didn't you see
how he stirred everything up

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.040
after coming here?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.930
Can you let us get any sleep at all?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.910
None of us can sleep because of you.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.560
Let's keep it down.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.750
Yes, Chief.

Get in.

I want Xiang.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.340
Get over there.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.280

Neither of them is eating.

No, he's totally weird.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.320
He hardly talks.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.210
His sidekick said

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.409
it's because he got beaten up
by some loser.

And his emotions have really been
all over the place lately.

We didn't break up. I didn't agree.

I told her I wanted to talk to her,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.820
but she just ignored me
and stopped replying to my texts.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.440
We didn't make things clear,
so it shouldn't count as a breakup, right?

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.070
Inmate 9416, calm down first.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.320
I'll find a time
to have a proper talk with you.

I don't want to talk to you.

I also need you to help me
keep an eye on Inmate 9568.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.050
Come to me immediately if anything happens
in Cell Block Violation.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.400
Got it, Senior.

Wa, you want to talk to me?

I want to have beef noodles.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.820
There's a famous old restaurant
called "Heirloom."

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.360
Get me a bowl of their noodles.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.530
The soupy kind won't do.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.860
And bring me a photo book from my room.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.160
But this is Cell Block Violation.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.610
That guy next door who keeps crying,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.690
tell him to shut up.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.990
So annoying.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.310
His girlfriend married someone else.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.260
Cut him some slack.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.650
Why should I?

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.690
It's been so long since they broke up.
How long is he going to keep crying?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.570
We didn't break up!

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.820
I didn't agree!
How many more times do I have to say it?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.570
You think just because you didn't agree,
it doesn't count as a breakup?

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.930
Who do you think you are?

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.070
You're just a little shrimp, okay?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.190
None of your business! Who are you?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.190
Wa, don't argue with him.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.150
He's your friend, huh?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.820
So you're too embarrassed
to laugh at him, right?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.420
People like that just
deserve to be laughed at!

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.940
Who are you?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.230
Stop laughing at me!

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.280
Don't fight.

ran off with someone else!

Come out and fight me one-on-one!
I'll kick your balls off!

Stop it, okay?

CO!

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.320
What are they arguing about?

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.440
It's nothing.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.320
Stop arguing!

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.400
Come on then.

You're a murderer!

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.280
What? It's not a tissue?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.400
That's my guard!

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.250
Please don't be so agitated, inmate.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.940
Director.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.530
What should we do?

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.440
What's the current situation?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.190
He's running around
and yelling loudly in there.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.530
My guards!

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.590
Did you touch his things?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.070
You mean those?

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.000
Did you call them paper figurines?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.420
Aren't they just tissues?

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.040
Those are his buddies!

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.300
-His buddies?
-No time for that now.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.570
This psycho has H.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.690
We need to put him in a straitjacket

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.570
to calm him down.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.690
Otherwise, if he keeps bumping around
like this,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.940
he'll end up covered in blood.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.940
Do you understand?

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.940
What is H?

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.320
HIV.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.900
You've been here for so long
and you still don't know what's going on?

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.070
Are you an idiot?

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.710
I'll handle restraining him.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.440
You know what that means?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.320
AIDS.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.380
A life for a life!

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.560
Get ready.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.870
Three.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:17.900
Two.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.630
One.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.780
Zhan Wenlin, calm down.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.610
Inmate, please calm down.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.810
Don't be so agitated.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.030
Don't be so agitated, okay?

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.020
Zhongwen, go!

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.250
Zhongwen!

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.130
Director!

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.090
Zhongwen, restrain him!

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.790
[Mona]

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.050
So, will I get AIDS?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.570
The report is out.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.540
What's the result?

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.280
It's negative.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.780
I think it's a pity.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.370
Here.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.910
This is the inmate log
our Education Division compiled.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.020
If you want to keep working in
Central Prison,

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.520
memorize it.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.950
I hate studying the most.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.070
S-So many pages?

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.940
There's more than one biter in there.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.390
Memorize it or not, it's your choice.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.900
The inmates in Cell Block Violation
all have their own triggers.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.940
Aside from HIV, Inmate 5119

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.900
also suffers from long‑term schizophrenia.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.230
The paper figurines you damaged

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.780
are like family to him.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.320
If you want to keep working in
Cell Block Violation,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.580
you need to know them better.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.760
But it'll take me several days
to finish reading this.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.680
You have to memorize it now.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.570
The last thing I memorized
was the multiplication table.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.300
Come on then.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.050
The multiplication table.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.820
What's 8 times 7?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.570
56!

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.570
Wrong. 87 is you—an idiot.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.400
Alright, let's give him
a bit of confidence.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.530
The key point is

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.010
you need to memorize
the inmates' keywords and characteristics,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.550
okay?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.160
Come on, Jiajun.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.100
I've only read this book once.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.570
Inmate 0776, life imprisonment.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.940
He has a mole on his face,
and he likes to fight and cause trouble.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.130
He's not afraid of anything but his mom.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.990
His favorite is popcorn chicken.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.530
So his memory points:
has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.530
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.020
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.570
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.320
You go.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.170
Has a mole on his face,
afraid of fighting,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.460
chicken mom, popcorn.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.500
Is it really that hard?

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.020
You two, repeat it.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.690
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.320
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.070
You two.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.690
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.690
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.690
Has a mole on his face,
afraid of fighting,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.570
chicken mom, popcorn.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.070
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.940
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.940
I really feel like giving you a slap.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.820
-Idiot.
-This is too hard.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.820
How can I possibly memorize all this?

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.280
Just let him get bitten then.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.570
I agree.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.900
Come on.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.660
Self-harm, loud and noisy,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.350
likes strip-shaped objects.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.530
Come on.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.570
Concentrate. Hurry up and memorize it.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.790
Likes to bite people,

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.400
has schizophrenia, and loves to laugh.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.440
Inmate 0776.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.570
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,
afraid of his mom, and...

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.440
Popcorn!

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.820
It's popcorn chicken!

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.690
It's popcorn chicken!

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.470
Inmate 4807.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.180
Inmate 4807...

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.470
Can't talk about his mom.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.090
If he loses control,
give him a braised egg.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.140
Inmate 2388.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.280
Inmate 2388...

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.180
Can talk about his mom.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.160
If he loses control,
put protective gear on him.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.500
The last one, Inmate 5119.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.210
Has schizophrenia,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.190
likes to bite people, likes anime.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.130
Yes. Finally.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.320
Finally.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.280
Wait.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:58.940
Inmate 0776.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.520
What kind of flower does he like?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.430
He knows. He knows.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.550
No, that won't do.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.570
Inmate 0776—what kind of flower
does he like?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820
Popcorn chicken.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.700
Class is over! I'm going home.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.390
I'll pack this up for you to bring home.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.860
I'm exhausted.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.350
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.420
Good luck.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:24.990
There's more?

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.950
Follow me.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.780
I know you used to learn taekwondo,

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.570
but in the prison, what we need
isn't heavy strikes,

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.440
but restraining the inmates.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.320
So judo actually works better
than taekwondo.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.320
Isn't judo just that martial art
where you grab each other's clothes

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.920
and twist each other around?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.820
Have you learned it?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.740
I've tried it.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.190
In the prison,
since it's not a competition,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.850
no one has rules in their mind.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.910
What you need to learn
is breaking their stance.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.850
Come on, try to break free.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.000
Use your strength.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.550
Didn't you say you'd tried it before?
Use your strength then.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.120
You've watched too many movies.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.750
This is completely useless in real combat,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.210
because the inmates won't just
stand still.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.480
Senior.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.840
You didn't even give me time to get ready.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.060
The inmates won't give you time
to get ready, either.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.180
Get up. Come on.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.080
You need to find my center of gravity,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.210
and then disrupt it.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.320
Shrimpies!

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.150
Shrimpies!

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.020
Senior.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.170
This is to avenge my Shrimpies.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.430
Come on! Let's continue.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.480
Get up.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.690
Come on.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.280
Center of gravity!

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.030
Feel my center of gravity.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.550
Senior.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.540
Are you okay?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.550
I didn't expect you to be so good.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.000
Let's continue later.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.780
Bring it on.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.070
Central Desk!

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.500
Cell Block Violation requesting backup!

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.470
Director!

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.530
Director!

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.280
He's banging his head against the wall
in there, as usual.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.780
We're ready.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.780
I've never seen a bumpkin like you.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.880
Show me what you've got then.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.780
Get ready.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.400
Okay.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.560
Three, two, one.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.070
Zhan Wenlin.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.420
Relax, inmate.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.460
We'll put you in a straitjacket now,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.180
so you can go out for some fresh air

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.310
and chat a bit with our social workers.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.540
Murderer!

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.780
-Director!
-Restrain him!

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.030
Don't let him bite you!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.570
Relax!

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.400
Jiajun!

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.490
Jiajun!

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.150
Inmate 5119.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.940
Has schizophrenia, likes to bite people,

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.860
and likes to imagine

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.400
that he's a character from an anime world.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.780
What anime?

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.190
Which anime does he like again?

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.030
-Which anime does he like again?
-Think fast!

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.150
How many words are there in the title?

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.030
Hurry up!

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.580
One word or two!

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.450
Digimon!

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.900
That's not it!

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.030
Pokemon! Pokemon!

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.780
Not that!

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.780
Doraemon?

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.840
Not that either!

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.780
Major?

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:57.620
Hurry up!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.980
Ju...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.400
Ju...

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400
Jujutsu Kaisen!

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.000
This is it!

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.580
Jutsushiki jyunten, "Ao."

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.270
Jutsushiki hanten, "Aka."

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.150
He's reacting!

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.270
It's working.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.240
So this is not the anime you like?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.700
You said you memorized it!

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.510
Well...

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.760
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.780
Beast Breathing!

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.280
Second Fang!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.910
Sharp Blade Counter-Slash!

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.230
It's Demon Slayer!

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.510
It worked.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.900
Tanjiro!

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.500
Found you!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.280
Tanjiro.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.090
I'm...

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.030
Inosuke.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.410
Inosuke?

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.050
You idiot...

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.030
Where have you been?

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.850
I'm sorry.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.650
I'm sorry.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.150
Inosuke.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.280
Tanjiro.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.530
Inosuke.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.240
I just slayed an evil spirit.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400
Don't worry.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.110
They're from our Demon Slayer Corps.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.570
You're injured.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.630
I'll take you to get treated.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.590
Get up first.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.400
Get up first.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.780
Tanjiro!

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.060
Tanjiro!

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.840
Jiajun.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.310
Put him in the straitjacket.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.060
Tanjiro!

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.030
Tanjiro.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.890
We'll help you put on
your Demon Slayer Garment.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.000
Come on.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.330
Your Demon Slayer Garment.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.690
-Demon Slayer Garment.
-Demon Slayer Garment.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.190
Demon Slayer Corps, pack up.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.900
-Demon Slayer Garment.
-Demon Slayer Garment.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.280
Demon Slayer Garment.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.270
Your meeting with him is over?

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.750
What's going on,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.680
already out of ideas
and resorting to fried chicken?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.210
I guess there's no other way, right?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.880
Yeah.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.530
Gao Zhiyao.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.900
Come here.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.840
Get over here.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.400
Think of a solution with us.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.440
What solution?

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.350
Get over here.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.030
Your friend has been on a hunger strike
for 3 days.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.150
He said if his ex-girlfriend doesn't come,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.530
he'll starve himself to death.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.650
I know this. I've talked to him,

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.530
but he wouldn't listen.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.780
I don't know what else to do.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.150
But he's your friend.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:21:59.650
Right.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.630
Help me talk some sense into him

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.230
and chat with him a bit, okay?

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.280
He's the one who got things
into this mess.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.030
There's no way things can work
between them now.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.900
What is love in this world anyway?

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.530
If he still refuses to eat,

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.790
I'll tie him up and force‑feed him.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.460
Miss Fang, no need to go that far, right?

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.810
I'll try talking to him again.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.560
Why are you holding your stomach
like that?

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.720
Director!

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.180
Director, I have a stomachache.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.150
Well, let me check.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.650
No, I mean I'm about to have diarrhea.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.710
I need to go to the restroom right now.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.290
I'll figure something out.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.760
Think about it while you're at it.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.330
Miss Fang, instead of only giving him
fried chicken,

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.180
the urn‑roasted chicken,
the four‑herbs chicken—

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.530
bring them all out.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.060
If he won't eat, I'll eat them.
How about that?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400
Is it this one?

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.560
Put it away properly.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.850
What about beef noodles?

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.650
It's really hard to bring beef noodles in.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.970
By the time they get here,
they'll be cold and not taste good.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.770
How about I give you
instant beef noodles instead?

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.530
Come here!

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.720
Come here.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.950
Stop it.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.780
Come here.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.030
Stop it.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.330
Have a lollipop.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.190
Here.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.200
Come here, let me flick your ear.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.000
I... I'll figure something out.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.570
Tadpole.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.400
Why are you hiding in the corner?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.150
Tadpole?

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.900
Are you trying to starve yourself to death
by not eating?

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.430
I might as well die.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.540
My life's ruined. I've lost everything.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.980
No way.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.280
You're so handsome and good at taekwondo.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.900
Don't imitate the way I talk!

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.460
You're really pesky.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.930
What's his girlfriend's name?

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.500
I'll tell my sister to bring her in.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.750
You can't do this.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.730
Let him have this book

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.150
and release a bit, and he'll be fine.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.980
You're really getting ruder and ruder.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:21.800
This is from the weird guy next door.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.690
Why don't you give it a try?

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.150
Also,

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.530
give him a lollipop

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.660
and tell him to stop crying.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.030
And a lollipop.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.530
Beef noodles.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.380
Got it, alright?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.780
Little shrimp.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.630
Enjoy.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.400
That's my favorite issue.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.350
They finally released the limited edition.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.030
Why did you have to give me this?

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.900
You forced me to betray Xiang!

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.520
Are you done crying?

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.530
-Xiang is with someone else now.
-Shut up!

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.780
Shut up! You don't understand!

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.380
Little shrimp.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.390
Stop crying.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.740
Your girlfriend ran off with someone else.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.260
You should be happy for her,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.530
for finding someone better than you.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.400
Right, stop crying.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.650
I'll take you to find a woman.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.050
I don't want anyone else.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.980
I only want Xiang.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.300
I might as well die.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.150
No sleep for us tonight again.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.440
I might as well die.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.650
Are you punching the wall
or banging your head against it now?

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.030
If you're banging your head,

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.900
do it harder.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.360
Only then can you die.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.530
You won't die if you don't bang it harder.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.280
Harder.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.780
What, afraid of the pain?

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.530
You see the fan?

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.290
Take off your clothes,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.530
hang yourself on it,

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.730
point the chopsticks

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.510
at your carotid artery,

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.100
and pull it downward.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.150
Stop being sarcastic, okay?

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.210
Sarcastic?

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.400
That's because
you're not determined to die.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.280
If you really are determined to die,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.780
block up the sink,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.400
fill it with water,
and submerge your head in the water.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.930
You'll be gone in 3 minutes.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.210
Or you can stand high,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.030
aim your chin at the sink,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.630
close your eyes, and jump.
Then your cervical spine will just...

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.780
Why did you go quiet?

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:53.810
Are you dead?

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.620
Stop crying.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.080
It's okay your girlfriend left you.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.530
It's not like you lost a piece of yourself
or something.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.530
That's right. You're a man.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.060
Don't lose the whole forest

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.700
for a tree.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.030
Calling Xiang all the time,
wailing like that.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.280
That's right. There are so many
pretty girls out there,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.530
tons with great figures. You can find
any kind of girl you like.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.390
You heard that?

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.150
Seriously,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.900
if you want to compare
who's got it worse,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.230
everyone in this row
has it worse than you.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.660
If you really want to die,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.550
make it quick. Be brave.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.130
If you don't,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.780
stop making us all
lose our sleep. Understand?

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.780
Nice, bro. That's more like it.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.450
Great. Now we can finally sleep.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.570
Bro, have you eaten?

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.200
I have.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.860
I heard you've competed abroad before.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.650
Yeah.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.310
I've been to Tokyo, Busan,

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.240
Jakarta, and Doha.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.260
Duha? Where's that?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.530
It's Doha.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.030
It's over in... Saudi Arabia.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.510
Let me tell you,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.710
the houses there are super pretty,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.300
and the streets are full of rich people—

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.230
there are a bunch of Lamborghinis.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.710
Have you been to Iceland?

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.530
Iceland.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.030
No.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.060
You want to go there, bro?

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.070
At the Doha Asian Games that year,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.030
I lost in the quarterfinals,

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:45.610
but it was still one of

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.280
the highlights of my life.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.730
Bro, do you have

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.330
any highlights in your life?

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.280
Life's full of ups and downs.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.690
I just keep going in
and out of this place.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.220
What kind of highlight
could I possibly have?

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.530
Seems like your life's been
pretty exciting.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.400
Mostly just fighting, though.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.110
What's exciting about that?

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.840
In official matches in junior high,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.530
I had 33 wins and 21 losses.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.090
Have you ever fought more than that?

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.930
Yes.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.010
More than that.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.000
So did you mostly win or lose?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880
Does it matter?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.260
Either way, I'd end up in here.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.140
So what was the reason this time?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.130
Cat abuse.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.300
I was in a good mood that day,

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.760
then I saw some idiot abusing a cat.
Darn it.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.030
So I stepped in to stop him.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.530
You got locked up for that?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.530
I smashed his face in.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.250
That was you...

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.420
Delivering justice, alright?

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.350
Sure.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.370
He finally ate something?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.400
Yes, finally.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.280
If he still wouldn't eat, Miss Fang
would use her ultimate move.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.940
Tie him up and force‑feed him.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.140
Sounds super scary.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.810
Gao Zhiyao, help me return this
to that buddy.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.410
Leave this to me.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.400
You're a full-time staff member now.
Be good, alright?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.150
Got it.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.650
Thank you.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.650
Wa.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.650
Your secret photo book.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.390
You came at the right time.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.080
Get me a photo.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.910
With snowscape.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.440
Preferably taken in Iceland.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.200
Also,

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.780
go to my sister

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.360
and get me something.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.030
Your sister...

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.780
Do you have to follow me?

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.250
You're making me nervous.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.620
What's to be nervous about?

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.350
You do your thing, and I do mine.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.990
Alright, go.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.900
But could you stop grabbing onto me?

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.880
Also, don't make it so obvious.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.590
Wa asked me to come and get something.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.970
Yes.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.770
Yes.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.030
Hello.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.090
How would I know
how much longer I have to wait?

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.870
Are you worried I might bail?

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.280
Yes, I'm here. Yes.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.570
I've told you

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.150
it's the Central Prison side
that's been holding us back.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.410
I've already paid for it.
I'm even more anxious than you...

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.010
Mr. Chen.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.820
Yeah.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.820
Don't you know how I, Zhang Wenfeng,
handle things?

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.750
Which room is it?

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.150
This Saturday.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.030
I'll have lunch with him this Saturday.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.280
I'll give you an answer.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.400
Whether it's yes or no,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.530
wait for my message.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.530
Alright.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.230
Look.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.790
What are you doing?

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.350
An ultrasound image.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.530
Let's take a look.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.180
Why did she give this to you?

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.330
She asked me to give it to Chihuahua.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.120
It's a baby.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:43.530
His baby?

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.290
Do you know who Zhang Wenfeng

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.290
is having lunch with this Saturday?

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.890
How would I know?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.540
I suspect Mickey Mouse will show up soon.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.150
7.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.320
What are you going to do
after you get out of here, bro?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.190
17.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.220
I don't even know if I'll make it out.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.730
Aren't you getting out soon?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.760
I have terminal cancer.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.900
If the treatment doesn't work,
I'll die in here.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:19.960
20.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.160
You won't. Don't think like that.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.440
Modern medical technology
is very advanced now.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.810
10.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.360
Have you ever seen snow?

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.840
Xiang and I saw it once
on Hehuan Mountain when we were kids.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.580
I want to take my wife to Iceland
to see the snow.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.710
She keeps saying she's loved Frozen
since she was a kid,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.770
singing "Let It Go"

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.920
all day long.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.680
So annoying.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.600
I'll take her to Iceland

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.970
and let her be a princess once.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.060
You're really romantic, bro.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.080
2.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.110
So do you have a kid?

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:11.739
Almost.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:13.630
It's on the way.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.250
I don't know if I'll get to see it

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.830
before I die.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:31.670
Wa.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.650
Your stuff.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.030
Congratulations.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.690
How's your health?

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900
Colon cancer.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.600
When did you find out?

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.740
Where are my beef noodles?

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.190
My mom used to take me to that restaurant.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.830
I want to have them one more time.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.780
Ginger as well.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.650
Don't cut it so thick. Slice it thinner.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.780
-You know?
-Senior.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.070
Master Jiu.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.400
This is the recipe for
my mom's beef noodles.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.650
This is our unique spice. Take a look.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.250
Can you arrange one meal of
beef noodles for me?

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.570
But the menu for all 3 meals

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.320
for the whole week
has already been planned.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.200
I know.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.030
But these are the beef noodles

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.450
Tadpole and I have loved
since we were kids.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.710
He's in Cell Block Violation now,
and he wants to have them.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.190
Please.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.920
Okay, I'll do it for your sake.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:18.740
Thank you.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.650
Coming right up.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.150
Time to eat.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.400
Thank you, bro.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.230
Was this made in the canteen?

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.100
Just have a try.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:52.720
How is it?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.680
Does it taste like mom's cooking?

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.920
You bought this from outside?

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.580
Does it remind you of your mom?

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.040
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.700
This is my mom's beef noodles.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.570
Are you trying to mess with me?

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.150
I'm serious.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.820
This is our family's beef noodle recipe.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.660
I asked Master Jiu to cook it accordingly.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.570
I've got you my favorite food.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.500
This noodle should still
remind you of your mom.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.310
Don't care about the details.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.150
Is it good?

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.690
Eat slowly.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.180
I miss the taste of Auntie.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.760
Go tell my mom this yourself.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.760
Can I get a second helping of noodles?

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.840
There's none left.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.340
Check the side of the bowl.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.270
And this.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.150
Here's another one for you.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.490
Back when we won matches,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.360
my mom would give us these.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.390
Collect 10, and we could
exchange them for a red envelope.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.180
You still remember that?

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.050
Keep it safe.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.280
My mom said you can use this sticker

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.650
to eat beef noodles for free for life.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.530
Thank her for me.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.970
Go thank her yourself.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.140
She asked you
to take good care of yourself

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.270
and go see her after you get out of here.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.280
She'll wait for you.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.220
I really envy you
for having a mom like that.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.730
Mom.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.130
Why are you back?

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.440
The canteen chef said there was extra,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.650
so he asked me to bring it back for you.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:41.570
Making a run just for this?

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.870
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.820
I do.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.810
Or are you sleeping at home?

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.220
I can't. I have an early shift tomorrow.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.320
How was it? Did everyone enjoy it?

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320
Did Tadpole eat it? This recipe.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.390
I gave him the stickers.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.130
He said

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.830
he would come to see you himself.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.460
He has some conscience after all.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.280
Tell him my noodle shop won't go under.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.940
I'll wait for him to come to me.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.510
Come on, put these things away.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:11.980
This.

Mom.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.650
I'm sorry.

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.480
Why?

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.070
I dragged you down.

Those guys before,

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.940
and me ending up working in the prison...

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.590
-It was all because I gambled.
-Hold on, hold on.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.790
Why are you suddenly
confessing your feelings like this?

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.980
I feel like I've hurt you.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.530

Don't cry.

I won't wipe your tears.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.430
You've been like this
since you were little—stubborn as can be.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.660
You wouldn't let me wipe your tears,

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.970
or even wipe your sweat.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:51.970
Alright, go back.

No matter what happens,
