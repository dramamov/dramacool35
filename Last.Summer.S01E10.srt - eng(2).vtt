00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.189
{\an8}My brother was always transparent.

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.361
{\an8}When I followed his gaze,
I could see it all.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:50.613
{\an8}That he wanted to stay with our mom.

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:52.866
{\an8}How's she part of our family?

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.368
{\an8}You're the one barging into my house.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.953
{\an8}We need to be together now.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.664
{\an8}We're going to see
the Summer Triangle from today.

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:03.334
{\an8}You said Gemini was your favorite
because it was just for the two of us.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:04.794
{\an8}Guys.

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:06.045
{\an8}What is that?

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:07.213
{\an8}I want to see it too.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:08.756
{\an8}-Me too.
-Give it to me.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.758
{\an8}-Come here.
-You guys…

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:11.676
{\an8}Hey!

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.261
{\an8}Let me see!

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.263
{\an8}-Hey, kids.
-Come here.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.599
{\an8}Don't get hurt.

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:18.892
Let me see.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.560
-They look the same.
-Constellations?

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.062
-Is that from The Little Mermaid?
-The Little Mermaid.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.356
That he completely forgot
about our promise

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:27.859
and now has a new family.

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:33.698
That he liked living
in this house with them.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.993
And that

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:39.871
he liked…

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:43.166
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:49.255
I knew why he liked her too.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.424
Because I also

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:53.885
fell for her in no time.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:57.430
The best you can do is step aside.

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:02.685
Do-young was transparent until the end.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.938
And not long after…

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.983
I heard that he'd gone missing.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.781
What do you mean?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.451
Just like I said.

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.370
So you're saying…

00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:23.498
Do-young is…

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:25.875
He was discovered…

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.003
in the south of Denali.

00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:32.131
So…

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:36.552
it took you this long to come back
because…

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:43.017
To bring him…

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:45.895
home.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:49.232
To Do-young's home.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.047
You did this alone…

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:16.217
All alone back then and even now…

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:17.719
You really--

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:26.436
I didn't want to confuse you

00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:29.564
when nothing was certain.

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:32.984
I've received too many messages

00:03:35.153 --> 00:03:36.362
saying that…

00:03:38.364 --> 00:03:39.324
it might've been him.

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.920
This time, I'll listen
and talk things through with you.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:55.548
So tell me everything.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.593
Everything that's happened.

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:14.859
Three years ago…

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.571
I received his belongings.

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:21.449
He'd gone missing.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:24.869
We knew what it meant.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.664
But…

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.293
nothing had been confirmed.

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:35.046
I wanted to believe

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.841
that there was a chance he was alive.

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:45.223
SONG

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.648
Hey, Baek Do-young.

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.942
Hello?

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:57.819
Hey!

00:04:58.403 --> 00:04:59.237
Hey.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:04.075
-Do-young.
-What is it?

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:06.994
My mom's in the ER now.
What do I do?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.540
I had no choice but to believe.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:58.963
I didn't want to
put you through this again.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:02.800
Our family had such a hard time

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.761
waiting for him to get back to us.

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:10.308
I know it's late,
but you deserve to say bye to him.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.351
I can't imagine…

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.481
how you've felt all this time.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:21.319
It's great to be young!

00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:36.459
I finally made it.
The amazing Peanut House.

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:41.714
Let's go inside. It's freezing in Korea.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.887
Not that way. To the right.

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:01.317
These scamps,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.237
they've never made a face like this
in front of me.

00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:10.493
But why is she always between my boys?

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:18.209
I was curious to find out
what's so special about the Peanut House.

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:19.919
It's not so impressive.

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:23.965
It's just the style, pattern, and texture
that were trendy back then.

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:27.301
It has absolutely
no architectural elegance.

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:30.638
Is this the best you can do,
Director Baek?

00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.600
It's more about practicality
than aesthetics,

00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.602
for the person living here.

00:07:38.187 --> 00:07:40.690
That's why no one's asking you
to design houses, Mom.

00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:44.986
Ever since he was young,
your dad never had an eye for style.

00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:47.738
His taste improved thanks to me,

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:50.950
but looking at this house,
it's back to square one.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:55.204
Ms. Nam, don't you think
that's too harsh to say right off the bat?

00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:56.706
You think so?

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:58.040
Sorry, Peanut House.

00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:02.712
You and I have met before, right?

00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:05.214
Yes.

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:12.430
Ms. Nam.

00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:20.187
Did you call me? Do-ha's friend?

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.772
Take him to a doctor right away.

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:24.984
If you keep neglecting him,
I'm reporting you for child abuse!

00:08:25.568 --> 00:08:28.446
He's had a runny nose all day,
and you didn't even notice.

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:32.158
Are you really that busy
that you can't tell your own son's sick?

00:08:33.868 --> 00:08:36.203
You still got that attitude.

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:38.664
You haven't changed.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.417
You haven't changed either,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.669
-still just as selfish.
-Hey.

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:54.388
It was a good call
to place him in the columbarium.

00:08:54.972 --> 00:08:56.932
He can finally rest in peace.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.478
I picked a place that's easiest to get to.

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:03.856
I don't think I can come often.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:05.900
Send me pictures sometimes.

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:12.281
But the three of you,

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:14.533
how are you coping so well?

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:20.539
This is actually our third memorial.

00:09:21.874 --> 00:09:24.502
We already held a funeral

00:09:25.628 --> 00:09:26.921
when Do-young went missing.

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.051
I'm sure you're shocked, Ha-gyeong.
We had a memorial already this year.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:36.389
Thanks to Do-ha,
we're doing it twice this year.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.937
Bringing him home wouldn't have been easy.
Do-ha handled it well.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.442
It was the first time
I'd ever seen Do-ha be stubborn.

00:09:53.072 --> 00:09:54.407
All right.

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:57.910
Why don't we go see Do-young?

00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:19.765
I guess what he ate
while climbing the Himalayas

00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:21.016
did the trick.

00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.477
What was that?

00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:27.231
It was like some curry,
which you eat with your hands.

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:29.817
Dalbam?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.944
It's dāl bhāt.

00:10:36.574 --> 00:10:37.533
I know Do-young

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:40.870
loved instant food and junk food.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:44.874
Whenever he visited the US in winter,
the three of us had a burger party.

00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:47.334
He loved a full-course Korean meal.

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:50.546
When Do-young came to Korea,
all he wanted was kimchi stew.

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:55.342
Can you not ruin my memories, please?

00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.223
When did he fix this?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.768
I can tell you did it.

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:07.688
I was always the one tidying up
after he made a mess.

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:11.859
You've been coming here all along?

00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:18.866
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
PASSPORT

00:11:23.996 --> 00:11:28.375
My son was real-world traveler.

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:33.005
He hardly had any time to be home…

00:11:34.632 --> 00:11:36.425
and kept busy, right?

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:20.052
Hey, Baek Do!

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:24.890
You said you'd be wandering around,
following the stars.

00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:07.182
Baek Do

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.605
lived a dramatic life
and made a dramatic comeback, too.

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:21.989
He must've had a hard time

00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.908
pretending to be Do-young.

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:32.958
Are you okay?

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:35.836
Did you stubbornness pay off?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.005
I'm really glad.

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:41.967
It finally feels like
we said goodbye to him properly

00:13:44.094 --> 00:13:45.804
and you and Mom look at peace.

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:50.267
You remember

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.020
when you said you'd come back
to the Peanut House?

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:59.234
You said it takes both determination
and a plan to come home.

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:00.778
Do you still feel so?

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:03.906
Think about what?

00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:06.241
I thought you were coming back
to Korea now.

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:09.328
I made up my mind, but I need a plan.

00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:14.333
It's different now.
Things are sorted out.

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:20.255
I'm telling the truth, Director Baek.

00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:23.634
Let's go, it's cold. Where's Mom?

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:41.402
Funny seeing you like this.
Has it been five months?

00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:44.655
I knew I'd run into you one day
because of Song or Do-ha.

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:46.657
I didn't know it'd be because of Do-young.

00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:48.951
Tell me about it.

00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:56.750
You're going to Seoul for training.
I need a ride to the station.

00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:59.420
I have a date today.

00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:02.423
Why?

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:05.884
Did you think I wouldn't date anyone
and wait for you forever?

00:15:06.927 --> 00:15:07.845
Put your seatbelt on.

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:23.861
The whole July 7 fate thing
was total bullshit.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:26.572
I guess Do-young made it up
just to recruit members.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:29.575
It's baseless and meaningless.

00:15:29.658 --> 00:15:31.285
Nothing showed up when I looked up.

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:36.373
{\an8}It was so frustrating
that I spent 12 years believing that.

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:38.584
I can't even punch Do-young now.

00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.509
Still, it was nice

00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:50.846
to see Do-young again.

00:16:06.862 --> 00:16:08.030
You've cleaned it out.

00:16:08.113 --> 00:16:09.740
I did the day after we broke up.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:18.832
I knew it.
You're surprisingly cold and brutal.

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:23.170
I cleaned everything up

00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:26.340
the very day we broke up.

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:30.427
Do you know how many boxes
of your things there were?

00:16:31.512 --> 00:16:33.514
I threw away all the victory pucks.

00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:37.893
There were roughly 127 of them
when I counted them.

00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:38.811
Good.

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:41.396
I don't do small talk anymore.

00:16:42.064 --> 00:16:44.399
Look. This frown.

00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:49.363
I've leveled up to a person
who is insensitive to others' feelings.

00:16:49.863 --> 00:16:50.739
Good.

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:55.661
My current boyfriend
is just amazing.

00:16:55.744 --> 00:17:00.624
I've only got a month of my twenties left,
so I'm making the most of it every day.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:02.876
I was hung up on one guy

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.754
for over ten years, and I had no idea

00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.675
there were so many guys out there.

00:17:14.346 --> 00:17:15.389
Was I too harsh?

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:19.726
Or are you jealous?

00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:22.020
Get off.

00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:24.690
You're here.
Your boyfriend must be waiting.

00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:31.363
Fine.

00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:47.379
Good job getting through it.

00:17:47.462 --> 00:17:50.507
I've had to arrange a funeral too,
so I know how hard it is.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.678
We kept it simple, though.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.473
I hope it's really over now.

00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:05.355
What do you mean?

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:10.569
Never mind. Let's just relax today.

00:18:13.238 --> 00:18:14.489
Let's get inside. It's cold.

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:26.418
I hope it's really over now.

00:18:42.017 --> 00:18:42.893
Baek Do-ha.

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:46.813
What are you doing?

00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:50.400
Are you okay?

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:56.406
Yes. Why?

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.242
I said, are you okay?

00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:00.327
Why are you here?

00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:04.289
You've been acting weird.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.627
What's weird is my room.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.505
I'm talking about what you did.

00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:15.842
Song Ha-gyeong…

00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:18.053
just how much did you miss me?

00:19:24.977 --> 00:19:26.395
DRILL IT WHEN YOU THINK OF ME

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.860
I should've told you
to knit whenever you missed me.

00:19:33.944 --> 00:19:36.029
Then I'd probably have ten more gloves.

00:19:36.113 --> 00:19:38.907
I was just trying to destress
during those months.

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:41.285
I asked you to drill it
in a heart shape, though.

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:42.369
I'm a bit disappointed.

00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:43.954
Geez, hey!

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:46.415
So did you find all the notes I left?

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:48.959
Can I go check?

00:19:57.092 --> 00:19:58.051
Why?

00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:04.057
These two were ones
I'd hidden in my room.

00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.517
How often did you sneak in?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.728
You know I'm competitive.

00:20:07.811 --> 00:20:09.813
You said to find them,
so I checked everywhere.

00:20:11.231 --> 00:20:13.275
You left so many naggy notes.

00:20:14.276 --> 00:20:16.820
-Your voice followed me everywhere.
-The plan worked.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.658
As I searched, I realized

00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:24.036
you'd written down all the things
you wanted to hear.

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.079
You never fail to impress.

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.791
But you haven't found the last one yet.

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:32.085
There's more?

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:33.295
Just as I thought.

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:35.964
I knew you wouldn't find it.

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:37.549
What? Where did you hide it?

00:20:40.135 --> 00:20:41.428
Somewhere you haven't opened?

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:44.598
Somewhere I haven't opened?

00:21:07.037 --> 00:21:09.289
USE SOLAR PANELS
AROUND THE OBSERVATORY

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:22.302
-Can't sleep?
-You too?

00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:27.474
Shall we have some hot cocoa?

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.738
I came downstairs because
I thought the light might wake you up.

00:21:42.322 --> 00:21:44.032
I might as well have stayed with you.

00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:47.077
I think you should get some sleep.

00:21:49.204 --> 00:21:51.415
Aren't you tired
after saying bye to Do-young?

00:21:53.375 --> 00:21:55.627
I usually can't sleep well in this house.

00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:05.387
How could I sleep?

00:22:06.555 --> 00:22:08.640
The girl I like is right next to mine.

00:22:10.976 --> 00:22:14.396
I hear you breathing softly
and tossing around.

00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:16.231
You wouldn't either, if you were me.

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:20.444
Not because
you're thinking about Do-young?

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:27.534
It's been ages since I went into his room.

00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:30.954
Looks like you've been going there often.

00:22:33.582 --> 00:22:36.793
I couldn't bring myself to go in there
all this time.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.842
Do-young's passport has so many stamps.

00:22:44.718 --> 00:22:46.553
Traveling around all those countries,

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:49.806
what did Do-young see
through that cheap telescope?

00:22:57.439 --> 00:22:58.857
I can't even remember.

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:00.567
I tried my best…

00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:04.654
to forget about Do-young the whole time.

00:23:06.072 --> 00:23:07.616
I'm such a mean person, right?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.620
I kept blaming you,
saying it was your fault.

00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:14.664
I tried hard to forget.

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.459
No way.

00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:20.212
You're kind

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:22.672
and transparent.

00:23:24.132 --> 00:23:25.258
Of course,

00:23:26.718 --> 00:23:27.719
Do-young was too.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:31.389
I was the bad one.

00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:34.601
Everyone in this house

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.729
was way too nice…

00:23:39.606 --> 00:23:40.440
unlike me.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.984
By the way,

00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:44.945
you broke your promise too.

00:23:46.154 --> 00:23:48.740
You said you'd shatter my fantasy
while we lived here.

00:23:50.283 --> 00:23:51.785
To shatter your fantasy.

00:23:51.868 --> 00:23:54.162
You have too many fantasies
about this house.

00:23:54.246 --> 00:23:56.706
Break them while living here.

00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:00.126
Hey, that's…

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.003
We really need to get some sleep.

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:05.006
Let's go upstairs. Should I tuck you in?

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.341
No thanks.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.344
I'm not a kid.

00:24:20.146 --> 00:24:20.981
What?

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.115
How late did he stay up making all this?

00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:39.874
Why are you back to work already?

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:43.044
How did the funeral go?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.172
Seems like you had a blast
while I was away.

00:24:46.256 --> 00:24:48.425
There are more delivery receipts
than work files.

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:49.884
Well…

00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:52.929
-What about the thing I asked you for?
-Right.

00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:58.810
Like you said,
whenever the solar plant was set up

00:24:58.893 --> 00:25:00.520
and site photos were released,

00:25:00.603 --> 00:25:02.439
there were reports
against the observatory.

00:25:03.189 --> 00:25:05.775
But there's nothing we can do on our end.

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:07.819
The complaints have eased a little.

00:25:09.738 --> 00:25:11.906
How was the honeymoon?
You had a good time?

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.284
Come on, that was three months ago.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.829
Your wedding gift was
the second most expensive,

00:25:17.912 --> 00:25:19.247
so you're excused.

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.210
Director, your friend's here.

00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:31.092
Seung-taek.

00:25:43.021 --> 00:25:44.314
Seung-taek, are you sure

00:25:46.358 --> 00:25:47.317
you won't regret this?

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:53.573
{\an8}FOUR MONTHS AGO

00:25:58.912 --> 00:26:02.207
This is totally barrier-free, but…

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.881
Seung-taek, are you…

00:26:14.386 --> 00:26:17.389
I'll leave it in your hands.
It's my last house.

00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:36.491
Hey, Baek Do.

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:41.246
It's been a while.
How about we go see the stars?

00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:46.918
It's quite neat now, right?

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:48.962
Yes.

00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:50.046
It's empty.

00:26:50.713 --> 00:26:52.507
It's been almost ten years.

00:26:53.883 --> 00:26:56.469
I haven't come since my accident.

00:26:57.387 --> 00:26:58.263
All my memories here

00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:00.640
are from when I could stand
on my own two feet.

00:27:02.392 --> 00:27:05.270
Thanks, man.
I got to relive those memories.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.235
Wow. It's still here.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:16.823
DENEB ROCKS, BAEK DO-YOUNG

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:22.245
Do-young lived like Deneb
till the very last moment.

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:23.371
I don't think so.

00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:27.041
He probably wanted Altair.

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:30.545
You know I spent a year

00:27:31.754 --> 00:27:33.131
pretending to be Do-young.

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:35.758
Back then,

00:27:35.842 --> 00:27:38.428
I went to the places he'd gone
and saw the stars

00:27:39.345 --> 00:27:43.558
to send photos and videos to Ha-gyeong.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:06.164
So when you pretended to be Do-young,
what did you realize?

00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:09.083
That I'm such a jerk.

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:11.044
No, you're not.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.174
You had no choice.

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:19.385
I know exactly how you must've felt

00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:22.764
pretending to be Do-young.

00:28:22.847 --> 00:28:24.432
I really understand.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:27.101
I know better than anyone.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.895
How would you know?

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.356
Dude, I know everything.

00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:47.372
Wow, look at how
freaking detailed this design is.

00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:48.498
That's my son.

00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:52.043
Like mother, like son.
It's the same down to the layer.

00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:54.045
No.

00:28:54.128 --> 00:28:56.756
I would never turn down
the Hermann project

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.385
to put everything into
the Patan High renovation project.

00:29:01.219 --> 00:29:04.472
That's the part
I felt was the least like Do-ha.

00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:07.433
But who knows what's on his mind?

00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:09.811
You're right.

00:29:09.894 --> 00:29:11.437
Three years ago,

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:14.357
he said we should give Do-young
a peaceful goodbye in the States.

00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:17.986
Then out of the blue,
he brought him back to Korea.

00:29:18.987 --> 00:29:21.739
Why don't you ask him?
He might tell you--

00:29:21.823 --> 00:29:24.742
As if. You still don't know him.

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:28.913
He's great at acting like

00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:31.374
he's okay with me.

00:29:33.543 --> 00:29:36.296
Actually, that's why I came.
I'll try to find out.

00:29:37.797 --> 00:29:39.841
I want to get to know my son.

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:45.763
Su-bak.

00:29:46.431 --> 00:29:49.475
Why's your dad so busy
as soon as he arrived in Korea?

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:52.520
Do you know why?

00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:54.606
Is he actually busy, or just acting busy?

00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:07.035
Don't worry. By the time you find
the last note, I'll have returned.

00:30:09.412 --> 00:30:10.288
Just as I thought.

00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:11.539
You wouldn't find it.

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:13.374
What? Where did you hide it?

00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:16.419
Somewhere you haven't opened.

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:18.338
Su-bak.

00:30:20.423 --> 00:30:21.966
What haven't I opened?

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.849
Is he back?

00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:40.777
What?

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:46.991
What's this?

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:48.534
Breathing holes?

00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:52.288
Ms. Nam.
Are you doing a Baek Do-ha tour?

00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:54.666
Yes. I'm investigating my son.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.170
By looking at a house, you can tell
what kind of people live in it.

00:31:03.508 --> 00:31:06.302
I wondered who your son takes after.

00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:20.191
Turns out,
Do-young is everywhere around here.

00:31:22.944 --> 00:31:24.195
I think that's Do-young's.

00:31:25.947 --> 00:31:27.156
The markings are different.

00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:32.620
I wonder what Do-ha had on his mind

00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:34.914
when he went to these places.

00:31:47.635 --> 00:31:50.638
Looks like he can't sleep here either.

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:06.946
Are you playing hide-and-seek
with your mom?

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.197
She just left.

00:32:08.281 --> 00:32:10.283
You know I'm good at games.

00:32:11.117 --> 00:32:12.493
If it's urgent, she'll call.

00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:18.916
Hey.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.376
Some things don't change.

00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:22.879
You still hide sleeping pills here.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.091
Don't you know insomnia
is an architect's best buddy?

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:29.177
How much sleep did you get?

00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:31.095
Four hours?

00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:32.013
In two days?

00:32:33.347 --> 00:32:34.182
In three days?

00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:38.936
Do-ha.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.064
Is it worse since Do-young's funeral?

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:45.735
What do you mean?

00:32:46.444 --> 00:32:50.740
{\an8}I became this successful
because I worked instead of sleeping.

00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:55.286
-Let's call it a day.
-Sure.

00:33:07.548 --> 00:33:08.382
Baek Do-ha!

00:33:47.296 --> 00:33:50.341
Looks like this isn't Do-ha's home either.

00:33:51.717 --> 00:33:54.262
This is when I wish Do-young were here.

00:33:54.345 --> 00:33:57.098
He knew everything about Do-ha.

00:34:57.825 --> 00:35:01.579
THE 27TH WILL TO HA-GYEONG

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.346
You scared me.

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:21.849
Why are you standing there in the dark?

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:25.770
You're late.

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:28.606
You look exhausted.

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:32.193
Yes.

00:35:34.528 --> 00:35:37.198
After being away,
I have so much work to catch up on.

00:35:37.823 --> 00:35:38.658
I see.

00:35:40.451 --> 00:35:41.577
Go get some rest.

00:35:42.995 --> 00:35:44.413
Sleep tight.

00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:45.915
Okay.

00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:48.167
I'm tired.

00:35:50.127 --> 00:35:51.796
Let's catch up on the rest tomorrow.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.062
Why should I feel guilty
because of my brother?

00:36:08.145 --> 00:36:09.730
I decided to focus on myself.

00:36:09.814 --> 00:36:11.774
What's precious to you
is precious to me too.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.443
I hope it's really over now.

00:37:03.284 --> 00:37:04.994
Every time that happened,

00:37:06.704 --> 00:37:07.830
our eyes would meet.

00:37:10.082 --> 00:37:13.294
One, two, three.

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:17.631
Every time I wanted something…

00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:25.514
and he gave it up for me.

00:37:25.598 --> 00:37:27.933
How long are you guys
going to go on like that?

00:37:29.018 --> 00:37:30.061
What do you mean?

00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:33.898
Did you know that
Song Ha-gyeong confessed to me before?

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:36.984
Back then, she told me that--

00:37:37.068 --> 00:37:38.527
I don't want to hear it.

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:40.863
Do-young.

00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:44.909
If you really care about us…

00:37:48.662 --> 00:37:50.748
the best you can do is step aside.

00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:54.293
And the last time our eyes met.

00:38:25.783 --> 00:38:27.076
What are you doing?

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:28.035
Going on a trip?

00:38:28.702 --> 00:38:31.122
I'm on leave. I should go somewhere.

00:38:37.586 --> 00:38:38.421
With you.

00:38:46.387 --> 00:38:47.596
Hey.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.099
-Wait, are we taking the train?
-Yes.

00:38:50.683 --> 00:38:51.642
Is it far away?

00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:54.603
I don't think I'd hear your real feelings
at Peanut House.

00:38:54.687 --> 00:38:55.646
So I'm kidnapping you.

00:38:58.065 --> 00:38:59.650
That sounds familiar.

00:38:59.733 --> 00:39:01.694
You can call it our last goodbye trip.

00:39:02.736 --> 00:39:04.780
No,
maybe we should call it a runaway trip.

00:39:11.412 --> 00:39:14.165
What do you mean?
Why would he suddenly come from the US?

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:17.918
What kind of a mom doesn't know
her son's friend's number?

00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:20.379
What?

00:39:20.463 --> 00:39:23.424
What are you talking about?
You think I'd know that?

00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:26.177
-Hey.
-Anywhere that he might go?

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.261
You know anything?

00:39:27.845 --> 00:39:29.305
Well…

00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:32.600
Mom got back from her honeymoon
with our stepdad,

00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:33.934
and Do-ha went missing.

00:39:42.651 --> 00:39:44.153
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:39:48.365 --> 00:39:49.241
It's you, Ha-gyeong.

00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:51.494
Who runs away from the US to Patan?

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.205
Me.

00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:56.582
Is this funny?

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.127
Why are you dressed so lightly?

00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:02.004
How did you know I was here?

00:40:02.087 --> 00:40:03.589
Where else would you go?

00:40:05.382 --> 00:40:07.927
Let's go, or you'll catch a cold.

00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:11.347
Your family and mine
are freaking out because of you.

00:40:12.056 --> 00:40:12.890
Ha-gyeong.

00:40:14.683 --> 00:40:15.935
It's our first winter

00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:18.395
since we kissed back in summer.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.107
Should we run away,

00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:24.860
just the two of us?

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.910
You were here.

00:40:33.786 --> 00:40:36.789
It's supposed to be a runaway trip.
You can't go back home.

00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:40.417
Let's go on a trip
to see the Winter Triangle.

00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:49.093
Wait.

00:40:50.302 --> 00:40:51.720
Why are we here again?

00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:57.810
To finally see the Winter Triangle
for the very last time.

00:40:57.893 --> 00:41:00.062
You keep saying "the last time."

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.856
Is this a goodbye trip?

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:07.861
We have to hurry.
We have to make it to the top today.

00:41:08.737 --> 00:41:09.572
Let's go.

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:21.834
You don't get along with your stepdad?

00:41:23.877 --> 00:41:24.712
Well…

00:41:25.754 --> 00:41:26.964
It's not bad,

00:41:28.132 --> 00:41:29.341
but it's not good either.

00:41:29.425 --> 00:41:31.051
Then why did you run away?

00:41:31.594 --> 00:41:34.471
I don't know,
it didn't feel like home anymore.

00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:38.851
It changed again,
since one person came.

00:41:41.353 --> 00:41:42.438
Funny, isn't it?

00:41:49.695 --> 00:41:50.696
Hey.

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:51.614
Put these on.

00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:54.325
The famous Song Ha-gyeong gloves.

00:41:54.867 --> 00:41:57.453
It's my first time
seeing it up close. Hey.

00:41:58.287 --> 00:42:00.831
-You think this will fit my hand?
-It fits like a glove.

00:42:35.199 --> 00:42:36.033
Here.

00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:41.288
What are you doing?

00:43:07.815 --> 00:43:08.857
Shall we go now?

00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:12.861
Yes, let's go.

00:43:20.119 --> 00:43:21.412
It's still here.

00:43:22.621 --> 00:43:24.415
We never really got to drink this, right?

00:43:24.498 --> 00:43:26.125
We never got to hold hands.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.586
I still have that in the box.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.505
-Exactly as it was.
-I know.

00:43:39.638 --> 00:43:43.392
Baek Do-young wanted to come here
back in high school?

00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:45.394
You know he's always been crazy.

00:43:46.103 --> 00:43:48.355
We can't blame him alone.
We went up with him too.

00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:50.065
Let's take a break.

00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.150
Are we there yet?

00:43:53.402 --> 00:43:56.905
Hey, I swear,
being around him makes me go crazy.

00:43:57.906 --> 00:43:59.324
You wouldn't know

00:43:59.408 --> 00:44:01.535
about all the stuff
that happened in Patan-myeon.

00:44:01.618 --> 00:44:05.205
You wouldn't know
all the stuff that happened in the States.

00:44:06.915 --> 00:44:10.377
You spent only two months a year together,
yet you act like you know everything.

00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:13.005
Says the one who's showing off
in front of his family.

00:44:14.715 --> 00:44:15.549
Fine.

00:44:15.632 --> 00:44:18.135
Then do you know what that rare mushroom

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:20.137
Do-young stuffed in his pocket
in Nepal was?

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.054
Yak poop.

00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:24.224
-His tear trigger?
-Sailor Moon's last episode.

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:27.644
What was the first R-rated movie
he watched?

00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:31.607
How would I know?

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.900
He said he saw it with you.

00:44:34.985 --> 00:44:37.488
What was his favorite food in Nepal?

00:44:37.571 --> 00:44:39.031
I saw it on the postcard. Samosa.

00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:41.784
-Not bad.
-Okay, then.

00:44:43.035 --> 00:44:45.662
Why did Do-young go looking
for the Summer Triangle?

00:44:51.376 --> 00:44:52.669
To form a triangle with you.

00:44:52.794 --> 00:44:53.754
Nope.

00:44:54.838 --> 00:44:55.672
You're wrong.

00:45:15.817 --> 00:45:17.152
Come on. You said it's here.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:19.238
It might be visible from the top.

00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:21.615
If you can't see it here,
it's just not visible.

00:45:22.699 --> 00:45:24.243
That's weird.

00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:26.286
There should be Betelgeuse,

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.996
Sirius, Procyon,

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.249
forming a perfect triangle around here.

00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:32.668
Forget it.

00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:35.420
I'll go to the bathroom.

00:45:35.504 --> 00:45:36.338
Okay.

00:45:45.847 --> 00:45:49.184
We'll be able to see the Winter Triangle
when we reach the top.

00:45:50.227 --> 00:45:52.729
Anyway, feeling better now?

00:45:52.813 --> 00:45:54.565
What do you mean, triangle?

00:45:55.649 --> 00:45:57.192
You don't even like this deep down.

00:45:57.859 --> 00:45:59.111
That's not true.

00:45:59.194 --> 00:46:01.280
I love that the three of us
ran away together.

00:46:02.364 --> 00:46:04.950
Why are you smiling? What's so funny?

00:46:06.243 --> 00:46:08.036
I know you can't stand it.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.954
What?

00:46:09.037 --> 00:46:11.999
Even now, you're annoyed
because I got between you two.

00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:14.376
So why are you smiling?

00:46:17.963 --> 00:46:19.047
Isn't that how you feel?

00:46:19.548 --> 00:46:20.382
What?

00:46:20.465 --> 00:46:22.384
Why are you projecting what you feel
onto me?

00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:24.136
You've felt that way all along.

00:46:24.219 --> 00:46:25.512
Who's the liar here?

00:46:25.596 --> 00:46:28.098
Me? Don't call me a liar.
Are you done talking now?

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.978
You guys were having

00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:34.396
a full-on staring contest,

00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:35.981
so I wanted to join.

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:45.157
You can't even land a hit.

00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:56.627
Bring it on.

00:46:57.294 --> 00:46:58.837
Still can't see it.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.380
We got fooled again.

00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:02.090
The Winter Triangle, my foot.

00:47:02.174 --> 00:47:04.092
Patan Mountain has a better view.

00:47:04.176 --> 00:47:05.010
That's right.

00:47:05.927 --> 00:47:07.346
Patan Mountain's view is better.

00:47:10.057 --> 00:47:11.892
I saw it on Patan Mountain.

00:47:11.975 --> 00:47:13.352
The Winter Triangle.

00:47:16.146 --> 00:47:18.148
Before Do-young left,

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.941
I confessed to him.

00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:26.448
Did you know that
Song Ha-gyeong confessed to me before?

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:30.160
Back then, she told me that--

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:31.411
I said that I liked someone.

00:47:33.622 --> 00:47:34.873
That I liked Do-ha,

00:47:36.625 --> 00:47:37.668
not Do-young.

00:47:40.003 --> 00:47:42.422
So I felt sorry for Do-young all along.

00:47:43.173 --> 00:47:46.176
Maybe he couldn't come home
because of that confession.

00:47:46.259 --> 00:47:49.221
Maybe that accident happened
because of me.

00:47:49.304 --> 00:47:50.931
I blamed and resented myself…

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.102
locking it up in a box.

00:47:57.354 --> 00:47:59.398
I felt guilty about opening that box.

00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:04.653
So I acted like I'd forgotten

00:48:05.737 --> 00:48:06.905
the whole time…

00:48:09.241 --> 00:48:11.868
But you kept coming every summer,

00:48:12.411 --> 00:48:13.620
and now in winter,

00:48:15.163 --> 00:48:16.456
you brought back Do-young.

00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:20.377
So I had to open it…

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.342
and there,
I found the last note you left.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.437
If I bring Do-young back,

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:40.814
will I be able to…

00:48:42.774 --> 00:48:44.776
stay in this house?

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:52.409
We tried to forget Do-young

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.413
by tucking him away in a box.

00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:00.792
I remember it all now.

00:49:02.502 --> 00:49:04.546
Why he brought you here ten years ago

00:49:05.213 --> 00:49:07.758
and the real reason he found
the Summer Triangle.

00:49:10.093 --> 00:49:11.344
It was all for you.

00:49:21.605 --> 00:49:22.439
What is this?

00:49:28.153 --> 00:49:30.155
Were you chasing stars in the US too?

00:49:30.238 --> 00:49:32.115
I took it when I went to Bear Mountain

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:34.826
with Mom, Do-ha,

00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:36.870
and my stepdad.

00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:43.794
I'm worried about Do-ha.

00:49:46.755 --> 00:49:50.383
How Do-young tried to overcome
a 14-hour time difference.

00:49:54.137 --> 00:49:55.597
Do-ha is moving again.

00:49:56.181 --> 00:49:58.266
He acts cheerful,

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.185
but I can tell he's sad.
He's transparent.

00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:06.149
Stars used to work best with him,

00:50:07.108 --> 00:50:08.819
but it doesn't seem to work anymore.

00:50:12.155 --> 00:50:13.990
I need some new ideas.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.705
How Do-young tried to bridge
a 9,500-km distance.

00:50:21.498 --> 00:50:22.415
I remember it all.

00:50:33.385 --> 00:50:34.219
Baek Do-ha.

00:50:35.846 --> 00:50:38.473
I made myself a promise
during those five months without you.

00:50:39.683 --> 00:50:41.434
I knew you'd definitely come back,

00:50:41.518 --> 00:50:44.521
and when you did, you'd tell me something.

00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:45.438
What could it be?

00:50:46.773 --> 00:50:50.777
I promised myself
that when I hear it, I'd hold your hand

00:50:52.404 --> 00:50:53.613
and never let go.

00:50:55.365 --> 00:50:57.075
I promised that to myself.

00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:07.335
You told me

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.672
that not all our memories were bad.

00:51:12.841 --> 00:51:13.925
Tell me

00:51:14.009 --> 00:51:16.803
what Do-young meant to you.

00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:24.936
Not sure if it was a dream…

00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:30.901
but I kept seeing him since I came back.

00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:38.325
SONG

00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:43.496
-Do-young.
-Yes.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.414
What do I do?

00:51:44.497 --> 00:51:45.332
To be specific…

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:47.667
What is it?

00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:49.377
…since I acted like I was Do-young,

00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:58.053
every time I slept,
I'd keep seeing his last moments.

00:52:07.437 --> 00:52:08.521
If I didn't sleep,

00:52:09.564 --> 00:52:12.108
his memories would come flooding back,
keeping me awake.

00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:29.292
It was painful,

00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:31.461
nostalgic,

00:52:32.712 --> 00:52:33.922
and delightful

00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:37.384
for those three years.

00:52:43.682 --> 00:52:45.058
But one thing's for sure.

00:52:49.354 --> 00:52:51.940
Ever since I moved in here
to live with you,

00:52:53.233 --> 00:52:54.484
he keeps showing up.

00:53:16.798 --> 00:53:19.009
All I remember is taking what was his.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.137
I was never a good little brother.

00:53:23.888 --> 00:53:25.432
I'm sure he resented me--

00:53:25.515 --> 00:53:26.891
You really think so?

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:30.061
Is he really that kind of person?

00:53:31.104 --> 00:53:32.647
Are you really that kind of person?

00:53:36.609 --> 00:53:37.986
Do-ha, you are

00:53:38.653 --> 00:53:40.155
someone who changes others.

00:53:42.032 --> 00:53:44.576
Since you came, I've changed so much.

00:53:45.618 --> 00:53:46.453
Look.

00:53:47.454 --> 00:53:49.831
I used to just let my hands freeze,

00:53:49.914 --> 00:53:51.916
but now I'm holding your hands.

00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:54.252
That's who you are.

00:53:56.046 --> 00:53:57.589
Do-ha, if it weren't for you,

00:53:58.965 --> 00:54:00.925
I'd never have sorted that box out.

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:09.434
I've felt sorry for him all this while.

00:54:11.394 --> 00:54:12.896
But back then, I felt like…

00:54:16.149 --> 00:54:18.234
if I said "sorry,"
I'd really start to feel bad.

00:54:23.573 --> 00:54:25.283
So instead, I kept blaming you,

00:54:26.034 --> 00:54:28.203
and you blamed yourself too.

00:54:29.162 --> 00:54:30.914
That's how we ended up going in circles.

00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:34.667
Do-young never blamed anyone.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.003
But we did whatever we wanted.

00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:41.466
We're such fools.

00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:52.268
Fools.

00:54:54.729 --> 00:54:55.688
Are you done watching?

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.442
Then you should go back home.

00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:08.326
Let's go back, Do-ha,

00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:11.037
to our house.

00:55:37.897 --> 00:55:38.982
Hi, Ha-gyeong.

00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:41.901
This is already the 27th will.

00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:45.697
It's the day before
climbing Denali in Alaska.

00:55:46.573 --> 00:55:49.784
I had a drink, hoping for
a successful climb and a safe return.

00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:52.787
Speaking of which…

00:55:54.747 --> 00:55:56.249
you want me to tell you a secret?

00:55:59.294 --> 00:56:01.421
The reason why I confessed to Ha-gyeong.

00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:03.131
I like…

00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:06.301
Do-ha.

00:56:07.844 --> 00:56:08.803
I actually confessed

00:56:10.555 --> 00:56:12.140
just so I'd get rejected.

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:16.895
I wanted to end it for the fools

00:56:17.437 --> 00:56:19.022
who couldn't confess properly.

00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:23.193
Are you calling me a liar?
Are you done talking?

00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:28.531
Looking into Do-ha's eyes,
I could see it all.

00:56:30.867 --> 00:56:32.952
The way he pretends to be mean

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:36.664
and then gets hurt by what he said.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:40.084
He is…

00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:44.047
as hopelessly kind-hearted as you,

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:46.966
so he doesn't even realize it.

00:56:52.305 --> 00:56:54.599
You knew there'd be no stars, didn't you?

00:56:58.186 --> 00:56:59.062
Do-ha might wake up.

00:57:00.396 --> 00:57:02.106
Did you really just pick a random spot?

00:57:03.608 --> 00:57:05.151
You're such a liar.

00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:07.195
Who cares?

00:57:08.196 --> 00:57:09.656
You want to escape Patan.

00:57:10.406 --> 00:57:11.824
Do-ha doesn't want to go home.

00:57:13.826 --> 00:57:15.119
We were happy thanks to that.

00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:26.172
So, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.509
If I can't talk later,

00:57:30.969 --> 00:57:32.512
then I want you to be Deneb

00:57:33.638 --> 00:57:36.766
to help connect me and Do-ha.

00:57:38.434 --> 00:57:40.645
That's the price
of being stuck between us.

00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:50.697
Do-young.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.283
Why is the Summer Triangle your favorite?

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:55.285
Summer.

00:57:56.202 --> 00:57:57.036
Every summer,

00:57:58.955 --> 00:57:59.956
you come back.

00:58:28.276 --> 00:58:31.696
I knew it from the beginning
that if I returned to this house,

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:35.783
he'd appear by my side again.

00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:08.358
This house showed me my guilt

00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:11.986
and kept me up all night,

00:59:13.446 --> 00:59:14.447
because the house

00:59:15.782 --> 00:59:18.242
was full of haunting memories.

00:59:18.993 --> 00:59:19.827
But…

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:28.878
now it's okay.

00:59:29.587 --> 00:59:33.341
This house has always been a place

00:59:34.092 --> 00:59:35.510
where people come and go.

00:59:35.593 --> 00:59:36.719
Baek Do-ha!

00:59:43.393 --> 00:59:44.227
Ta-da.

00:59:53.277 --> 00:59:54.987
It's like a whole other world.

00:59:55.988 --> 00:59:56.823
Right?

00:59:57.824 --> 00:59:58.825
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:59:59.701 --> 01:00:01.244
Can I make every step I take mine?

01:00:02.995 --> 01:00:03.830
It's yours.

01:00:05.373 --> 01:00:06.499
It's all yours, Do-ha.

01:00:19.262 --> 01:00:20.555
Hey, that's mine.

01:00:20.638 --> 01:00:22.181
Fine, take it.

01:00:24.642 --> 01:00:25.727
It's snow!

01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:27.311
Song Ha-gyeong.

01:00:28.563 --> 01:00:31.983
Do you think we'll ever move out
of this Peanut House?

01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:35.403
I don't know.

01:00:36.362 --> 01:00:38.406
Maybe if the roof caves in

01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:41.868
or the house falls apart in a storm?

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:48.916
So, until that day comes,

01:00:50.084 --> 01:00:51.043
it's my house.

01:00:53.546 --> 01:00:54.380
Sure.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.007
It's your house.

01:00:56.966 --> 01:00:58.509
It's all yours, Baek Do-ha.

01:01:09.145 --> 01:01:09.979
I'm doomed.

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:14.901
My hands won't freeze.

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:17.445
Hold my hand.

01:01:22.492 --> 01:01:23.409
It's warm.

01:02:17.672 --> 01:02:18.631
{\an8}Is this how you do it?

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.009
{\an8}What's this now?

01:02:22.093 --> 01:02:24.428
{\an8}Song Ha-gyeong, stop seducing me.

01:02:24.512 --> 01:02:26.097
{\an8}What's all this about?

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.350
{\an8}Since I'm really back now,
I need to keep my last promise.

01:02:29.433 --> 01:02:30.560
{\an8}But it won't be easy.

01:02:30.977 --> 01:02:32.728
{\an8}There's a proper order for everything.

01:02:32.812 --> 01:02:33.855
{\an8}Charge forward!

01:02:33.938 --> 01:02:38.401
{\an8}The main reason this project got held up
was Pluto, wasn't it, Director Baek?

01:02:38.943 --> 01:02:40.069
{\an8}Baek Do!

01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:41.362
{\an8}How much did you drink?

01:02:41.445 --> 01:02:43.489
{\an8}We see each other
more than we did back then.

01:02:44.532 --> 01:02:48.369
{\an8}We've been getting along without fighting.
I guess it's really winter, right?

01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:53.124
{\an8}Feels like tonight could be
our last night.

01:02:53.207 --> 01:02:54.542
{\an8}Wait, a leave of absence?

01:02:55.585 --> 01:02:56.794
{\an8}Junior!
