Chihuahua,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.080
your visitor meals
are too greasy and salty.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720
You ate them and ended up in the hospital.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.250
You need to watch your diet.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.910
You sent me to the Health Division twice,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.050
and you're a doctor now?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.500
I'm sent here to take care of you.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.580
Boss.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.540
I don't eat visitor meals.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.890
Tell the kitchen to make our food

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.600
a bit more presentable.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.850
That's not the kitchen's fault.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.930
Everyone's food is the same.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.000
Officer,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.740
the slop from the kitchen...

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.640
Two days of it is enough
to make me want to bust out.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.740
-Is that right?
-Bust out?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.540
Are you threatening an officer?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.080
It's really inedible, Boss.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.510
You can beat me to death,
but it won't change that.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040
I think it's the food from the kitchen
that is giving me the runs.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.830
Listen to me.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.950
If we eat well,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.650
we don't cause trouble.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.350
Hey. Where's your CO?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.630
In the bathroom.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.370
Is there a problem?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.410
No problem.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.530
What are you doing?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.250
How many times have I told you?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.829
Use a bowl to taste the food.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.120
Hygiene matters, you know?

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.329
Master Jiu?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.880
Sorry to interrupt.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.800
I just want to give some advice.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.740
What?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.550
Got a problem with our cooking?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.860
Some of the inmates think the food is bad,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.610
and they keep getting the runs.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.950
So you are

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.410
criticizing our hygiene?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.390
No.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
I think it's their problem.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.930
But they think it's your problem.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.650
In the end,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.370
you're still saying it's our fault.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.820
Come here.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.520
Everyone, listen up! Come on!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.010
This CO here

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.660
wants to review the hygiene of this place.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.370
It's a misunderstanding.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.320
Master Jiu, don't put it like that.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.850
I just want to...

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.270
I just want to say...

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.720
Say what?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.350
Are you looking for trouble?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.620
Some people can't stomach it.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.370
Who?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.250
Who is it?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.579
Who?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.110
Hold on.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.800
Look,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.630
you guys are pros,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.480
right?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.870
I'm just asking if the food could be

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.950
made a little better.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.829
More delicious.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.250
Go eat slop. It's faster.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.450
-Come on.
-You think you're in a hotel?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.500
Show him that.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.710
Show it to the CO.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.760
He'll understand once he sees it.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.380
Look.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.400
Look at this.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.320
The radishes are moldy.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.710
Come on, look.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.760
The greens are rotten.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.340
Look at the meat.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Nobody would buy this crap.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
It stinks.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.980
And over here, look.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.950
The dried tofu has gone sour.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.190
Want to smell it?

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.790
Same with the meatballs.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.750
Who knows how long ago they were made?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.700
Exactly!

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.760
They complain if the food sucks;
they complain if they get the runs.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.250
But we're given ingredients like these.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.880
We can't work miracles.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.830
How good do they expect it to be?

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.840
We're done cooking!

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.090
Strike!

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.450
Let him cook it himself!

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.900
I was wrong! Everyone, calm down!

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.900
Master Jiu.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.960
I'm sorry.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.080
Look,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.680
I was just passing on feedback.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.320
I'll report the ingredient issue, okay?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.400
Here, have this pack of cigarettes.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.140
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.220
You're all talk.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.340
I can do that too.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.470
Please.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.490
Alright. Forget it.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.310
Back to work.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.670
You can't do this, Sir.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.990
I said forget it!

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.280
Shut up and move the veggies back.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.420
Next time, get your facts straight

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.610
before you come here causing trouble.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.570
Move the radishes over there.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.710
Sir.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.400
Anything else?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.510
Nothing.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.630
Master Jiu,
I'll report the food quality issue.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.470
Morning, Senior.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.940
I'm here to check for the kitchen.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.140
Good morning, Sir.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.350
What's up?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.350
Morning, Cai.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.500
Cai.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.250
These vegetables are rotten.
You're accepting them?

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.500
It's fine. The outside is rotten.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.700
Just pick it off, and it's still edible.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.970
No, it's not just the veggies.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.320
Everything has… has quality issues.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.880
Zhiyao, you're not a rookie anymore.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.990
You should know how things work.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.320
Don't look for trouble.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.810
This stuff has all been inspected.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.040
No, but there is a problem…

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.040
Cai, the quantity is correct, right?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.790
No problem.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.820
Hey man, your veggies are bad.
Can we return them?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.260
Isn't that a bit much?
They just got squashed on top.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.230
-It's all the same once cooked.
-I know.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.980
Just squashed on top?

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.280
Look at this, man.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.520
It's completely rotten.
We can return this, right?

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.220
Fine, return it if you want.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.390
-I'll make it up in the next shipment.
-Okay.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.030
No, wait. Leave it.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.130
You can't return it.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.950
The inmates will have nothing to eat.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.850
They'll riot.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.590
That's it. Done.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.970
Just be careful next time.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.970
Alright.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.040
Be careful next time.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.700
I know. I'm off then, Cai.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:34.950
Cai.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.610
That supplier looks shady.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.010
My family runs a restaurant, so I know.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.860
Can't we switch suppliers?

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.610
Look,

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.370
we scolded him this time.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.870
He'll be more careful next time.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.170
He'll improve the quality.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.100
Besides, we're a government unit.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.880
Switching suppliers isn't that easy.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.330
You think you can just switch
like buying groceries?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.430
This is buying groceries.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.470
Stop looking for trouble.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.780
Do you have too much free time?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.780
I'm very busy!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.600
Zhongyi.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.420
If the count is right.
Send them to the kitchen.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.290
-Weird.
-Come on. Haul them away.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.280
Zhiyao.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.400
Senior.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.760
What are you doing here?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.750
Inmate 9568 has been
experiencing diarrhea lately.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.150
He said the food is bad
and asked me to check.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.180
Turns out the food really stinks.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.180
What is that smell?

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.200
The smell of rotten vegetables.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.500
I've heard rumors

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.430
that our food quality is unstable.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.080
So I suspect
someone is skimming off the top.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.770
Is it Cai?

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.890
Cai is just a little mouse.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.549
We need to catch Mickey Mouse.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.230
Mickey Mouse?

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.570
That's my codename for this person.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.400
Anyway, just keep watching
and keep looking.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.130
We'll check every single item.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.730
Let's see who cracks first.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.230
It's definitely that supplier.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.700
Can you stop being

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.420
so simple-minded?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.080
It could be someone higher up.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.510
Just keep investigating.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.440
Good luck.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.770
Wash your hands.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.600
Dispensing cold water.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.840
Dispensing cold water.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.920
Yes!

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.190
Yes!

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.910
Cai, you're still here?

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.110
I forgot my car keys.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.010
You…

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.670
-You're the counselor, right?
-Yes.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.130
What are you doing here?
You need something?

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.970
Cai, I heard you bought this amethyst

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.240
at a great price.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.560
You're interested in amethyst?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.120
Let me tell you.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.240
A friend of a friend introduced me to it.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.060
After I bought it,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.330
I really felt my energy flow better.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.210
Most importantly,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.880
you have to buy this first—

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.020
the money toad.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.950
After I bought it,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.910
just like this,
I got promoted three ranks.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.960
We have to believe that
the gods will protect us.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.330
So I want to give you a token—

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.020
a protective amulet from Fu'an Temple.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.870
-Cai.
-It works if you believe in it.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.830
It's not superstition.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.700
I have duties to attend to.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.750
-Here, hold these for a sec.
-So…

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.330
-Wait…
-Put them in the front seat later.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.200
I'm busy with work, Cai.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.700
I insist on giving you this token.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.580
Just wait a second.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.370
Don't be in such a rush.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.370
Jiang, here.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.200
This is the token.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200
-No thanks.
-An amulet from Fu'an Temple.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.870
Really, Cai,
you don't need to give me anything.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.670
This is fate. See it as a little token
of our connection.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.500
The gods will really protect you.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.330
Thanks, Cai. Thanks.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.130
-See you tomorrow.
-Drive safe.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.200
Thanks for your cooperation, Cai.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.360
Inmates these days
yap about human rights all day,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.840
always threatening to sue us.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.440
Let me check. It'll be quick.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.590
The veggies are great.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.510
Cai gave special orders

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.290
to bring the freshest stuff.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.160
Is everything on the right ours?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.220
Yes, yours.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.440
I'll take a look too.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.010
No. That's just squashed.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.330
I'll talk to them when I get back.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.620
Just a little bit.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.830
Sir, did we order stinky tofu?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.670
Zhiyao.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.330
It will be fixed tomorrow!

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.160
If not, you're disqualified!

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.410
What's wrong with you? I told you already.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.420
I know.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.510
I'll handle it now.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.560
Gao Zhiyao.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.310
Why quit the team?

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.150
Isn't your foot almost healed?

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.520
Healed my ass.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.490
It'll heal.
You've got the "Golden Right Foot."

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.050
The doctor said I need to rest
and rehab for two years.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.630
So do the rehab.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.190
I'll stick with you for two years.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400
Shut up.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.370
You want me to be a sparring partner

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.370
and watch you prep for the Olympics?

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.700
Good luck to you guys.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.320
You lost to me once, and you quit?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.830
I kept playing until now

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.270
only because of you.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.140
If you give up like this,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.150
I'll look down on you forever.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.030
If you hadn't messed me up,
would I be like this?

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.530
Zhongwen, wait.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.190
Inmate 1026, wait.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.010
I want to speak to this inmate.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.250
Don't chat with the inmates.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.920
Okay.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.570
Don't get me in trouble.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.490
Just a second.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.460
Just a sec.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
I'm Gao Zhiyao.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.760
Don't you recognize me?

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.920
Sir, can I go?

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.400
I have work in the kitchen.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.770
It is you, right?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.430
Tadpole.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.700
What's wrong with you?

00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.810
Director.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.970
Gao Zhiyao, are you slacking off?

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.430
Take him away.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.720
Inmate 1026, we can go.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.320
Let's go.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.720
How did you end up in here?

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.620
What are you doing?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.350
Director,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.230
I ran into someone I know.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.080
What a coincidence.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.790
He's a good friend of mine.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.100
Then how did he end up in here?

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.600
I don't know.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.540
You don't know,
and you call him a good friend?

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.280
Are you trying to mess with me?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.250
You worked so hard
to get this full-time spot.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.380
What the hell? This could end up badly.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.250
What do you think he's in here for?

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.980
Summer camp?

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.870
Get it straight.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.710
You are an administrator. He is an inmate.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.070
Understood, Director.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.400
Don't be a clueless idiot.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.410
He ate free beef noodles here
for ten years.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.620
I never saw him come back.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.620
That brat…

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.650
You said you ran into him?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.870
Is he your colleague or…

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.880
Not a colleague.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.080
Why?

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.120
How did he end up in jail?

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.740
Arson. Involuntary manslaughter.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.500
Oh my god.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.330
That's serious.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.540
What are his parents supposed to do?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.150
They must be heartbroken.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.290
You kids...

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.270
My gosh.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.320
Parents worked so hard
to raise you to this age.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.510
You quit playing just like that.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.240
And now one of you is in jail.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.730
I really...

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.110
All of you...

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:02.570
It was all in vain!

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.380
You kids really piss me off.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.060
Excuse me.
Here are the side dishes. Enjoy.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.130
Why aren't you going back?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.060
Don't you have to work?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.329
Mom.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.410
What?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.000
I want noodles.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.540
Cook them yourself.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.830
You cook them for me.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.890
I'm already on it.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.380
Half tendon, half meat?

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.590
What's with that face?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.660
Next time there's a vacancy,
it'll be your turn.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.800
But my wife and I have decided on daycare.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.320
That's an extra 10,000 a month.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.250
That expensive?

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.150
Yeah.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.930
And...

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.460
my wife missed
her period again this month.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360
Pregnant again?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.890
We don't know yet.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.780
Whoa, that's impressive.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.510
No wonder you're so huge down there.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.260
And you're small down there.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.960
Getting a reaction?

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.290
Cut it out.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.300
Having fun?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.620
Counselor.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.330
Counselor.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.850
Nothing is happening right now,

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.630
but stay alert at all times.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.750
We never know when danger will strike.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.360
Yes.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.820
Zhongwen, go back up Shun.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.750
I've got this area.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.120
Yes.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.110
So?

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.200
Are the ingredients normal now?

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.190
Much better.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.080
But I'm thinking

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960
Cai might not be the one embezzling.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.750
Because he's just...

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:45.950
How do I put it?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.330
A typical civil servant.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.750
He doesn't want
to get involved in anything

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.910
and does the bare minimum to get by.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.800
You're amazing.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.430
Yeah, that's exactly who Cai is.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.510
So it can't be him.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.630
Plus, Cai doesn't have the authority
to pull this off.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.290
The guy can control the budget

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.790
and plant his own people.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.360
He's higher up than we thought.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.210
I know. Let's just ask Cai directly

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.740
who Mickey Mouse is.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.320
Wouldn't that solve it?

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.020
Check it out.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.320
Inmate 9416, what are you doing?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.950
Tadpole.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.580
What are you doing?

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.280
There's a kid inside.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.280
There's a kid inside.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.990
Little girl!

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080
Can you hear me?

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.360
It's hot.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.070
Little girl!

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.940
Little girl, can you hear me?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.800
All doors are locked.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.510
Little girl!

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:49.160
All the doors are locked.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.490
Locked on this side too.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.900
How long has this car been here?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.560
It's been here the whole time.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.670
Little girl!

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.760
Little girl!

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.370
Can you hear me?

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.280
Little girl!

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.360
-Hey, Tadpole!
-Inmate 9416!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.040
Tadpole!

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.630
Everyone, squat down!

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.740
Squat down!

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.280
What are you doing?

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.510
Try this.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:13.950
What is this for?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.460
Just trust me.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.850
Zhongwen, I have a situation here.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.700
It's open!

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.220
Little girl.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.540
Careful.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:31.920
Little girl.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.550
Little girl.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.230
Her mom just went to buy something
while she slept.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.110
It's so hot. Thank goodness she's okay.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.440
Thank you for your help.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.560
We'll be going now.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.030
Thank you for coming.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.970
Thank you.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.380
Tadpole helped
with the kitchen issue last time too.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.470
I know you're friends.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.020
But don't forget he's serving time.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.990
I know.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.670
So what should we do about Cai?

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.680
Are you close with Mona?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.680
Ms. Mona?

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.190
I guess we are.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.840
I go there
for late-night snacks sometimes.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.720
Why?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.730
Cai is very superstitious.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.480
He always goes to Mona
for astrology readings.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.120
You again? What now? You're annoying.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:25.980
Seer,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.910
check my career and wealth luck for me.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.110
How many times a week do you have to ask?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.440
It's the same question every time.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.160
Got too much money to burn?

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.200
So?

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.470
So I might need you

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.920
to ask Mona to help us trick Cai.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.640
No way. As if she'd agree.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.610
Ms. Mona agreed.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.040
But she wants us to do a few things first.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.220
Okay. Like what?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.140
Alright.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.510
To deal with Cai,

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:01.360
first, we need to create an evil spirit.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.110
Zero two two.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.230
An evil spirit.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.530
There is an evil spirit
in General Affairs.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.490
Next, we let the evil spirit

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.460
infiltrate Cai's daily life.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.840
Another one.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.870
The roaches here eat too well.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.120
Another one.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:25.640
Zhiyao.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.790
Blood for blood!

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.990
What's wrong with you?

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.510
It feels spooky,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.040
like something's gonna possess me.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.020
You're such an idiot.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.510
Just now,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.520
was there a breeze?

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.920
No.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.530
Senior!

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.250
Senior!

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.300
Seer.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.580
The things happening to me lately

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.660
are just too bizarre.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.470
The other day, at the water cooler,

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.530
the machine suddenly spoke to me.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.520
Do you know what it said?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.340
"Dispensing cold water."

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.600
Dispensing cold water.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.390
D-Dispensing…

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.880
c-cold…

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.820
w-water.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.940
You really love stealing water.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.710
Screw you!

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.190
Can you live with yourself?

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.870
You come to me after work every day.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.700
Do you like me?

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.040
I want to be with you forever.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.600
Did you charge the speaker?

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.660
You didn't steal my water.
You stole my heart.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.410
Ready.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.470
One, two, three.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.790
Dispensing... c-cold... water.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.200
What is going on? Oh my god.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.910
That water...

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.030
Don't drink it anymore.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.620
Why did it say those things to me?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.750
Oh my god.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.450
What is happening to me?

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.000
Am I being haunted?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.650
Cai.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.690
You're usually by the book.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.870
But this reading

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.660
looks very serious!

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.300
Have you done something shady?

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.470
I haven't.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.280
Speak the truth.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.250
Or how can I resolve this for you?

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.120
Even if you just turned a blind eye

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.840
to the dirty deeds happening
under your watch,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.830
it is the same.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.720
Speak.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.510
I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.050
It's the Chief of General Affairs.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.670
Who?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.350
The Chief of General Affairs.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.010
The Chief of General Affairs.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.910
H-He ordered me

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.630
t-to let things slide.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980
To let what slide?

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.260
The ingredients coming in—

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.780
the vegetables and stuff.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.440
They were rotten, foul, and spoiled,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.240
but I let them through.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.180
You let them through and take kickbacks?

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:48.840
But

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.530
I think it's not that simple.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.060
The Chief is

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.670
just a mid-level manager.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.450
There must be someone
higher up ordering him.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.550
You know me.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.120
I'm always law-abiding
and down-to-earth.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.450
If not to make a living

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.670
and raise five kids,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.070
how could I do something so sinful?

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.620
Having five kids is a sin.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.370
The world's crowded enough.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.690
Why have so many kids?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.240
You didn't wear a condom.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.500
Serves you right!

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.010
So who is Mickey Mouse?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.670
Feels like it's not that simple.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.060
How do I resolve this?

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.390
Alright, let me communicate with him.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.010
Okay, I got it.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.060
Speak and then leave.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.990
Begone! Begone!

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.730
Alright.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.280
Six words.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:40.990
Say it out.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.330
Spit it out.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.980
About Cai…

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.180
how did the higher-ups handle it?

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.730
Cai was transferred.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.620
And

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.250
the Chief of General Affairs resigned.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.230
That's it?

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.620
We went to all this trouble.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.720
Didn't we suspect
there was someone higher up behind it?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.510
Yeah.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.700
They definitely have other backers.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.980
Anyway, I'll figure it out.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:15.890
Warden.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.200
There's a vacancy in General Affairs.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.040
I'm transferring Zhikai there.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.110
What do you think?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.530
What do you want?

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.390
Why did you let them off like that?

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.750
Why didn't you keep investigating?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.950
Why let the subordinates take the fall?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.950
Deputy Warden.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.040
Handle the personnel arrangement

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.460
in General Affairs as you see fit.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.130
Understood. I'll leave you to it.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.150
Deputy Warden.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.390
So, did you suppress this case?

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.600
I told you.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.590
I'm fighting for the expansion project.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.700
The Central Prison
cannot afford any incidents this year.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.870
Next time before you act,

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.270
can you let me know first?

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.450
I know you're busy
with the expansion project.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.370
But do you know someone

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.000
in our prison has ties to the mob?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.870
They even sent someone directly

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.330
to look after Inmate 9568.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.280
That's none of your business.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.620
I have my methods.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:07.810
Dad.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.670
Enough!

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.980
In what capacity
are you speaking to me right now?

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.580
Please leave.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.650
Fine.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.100
I know you have your methods.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.600
But I have my principles.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.100
I am definitely going to
catch Mickey Mouse.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.980
Mickey Mouse?

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:57.860
Thanks.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.900
You fought with your dad?

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.910
Want to talk about it?

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.600
If not, I'm leaving.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120
I often wonder...

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.400
if I were his biological son,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.330
would I be able

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.790
to understand him better?

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.750
I wouldn't say that.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.690
He has always wanted to protect you.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.880
He just protected you too well,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.680
and it built a wall between you two.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.730
Why does it sound like

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.170
you're calling me a daddy's boy?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.540
That's not what I meant.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.170
You've been doing well.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.040
Thanks.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.530
You gave me the wrong one.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.470
My bubble tea.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.520
Thank you.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.140
Not bad.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.970
Meat Soup.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.300
It tastes fresh.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.420
Oh yeah.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.070
Yeah.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.810
Here, Tiantian.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.910
It's improved.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.670
Eat more. You've lost weight.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.700
Yeah.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.670
Thanks, Boss.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.940
Inmate 9568.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.260
Report to the Health Division tomorrow.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.080
What for?

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:57.630
Who knows?

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.340
Hey, where's Tadpole?

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.500
Tadpole? Over there.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.620
Thanks.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.140
You really are a taekwondo fighter.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.960
That was a high kick.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.170
What?

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.180
Wanna fight?

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.080
Why aren't you talking?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.860
Here, try this.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.430
Your fellow inmates made it.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.250
New flavor. It's pretty good.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.890
Thanks.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.440
I know you've been helping me.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.120
I just didn't want to eat garbage anymore.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.760
It's not just the ingredients.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.650
The other day,

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.940
you helped that kid in the car.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.600
How high can you kick now?

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.120
High enough to press your head down.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.430
Try it then.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.720
You really kicked me.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.640
I kicked you? Sorry.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.840
Idiot.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.220
My bad.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.840
How did I run into you here?

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.810
Seeing you

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.930
reminds me of the old days.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.930
I thought you'd stick with taekwondo.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.580
Do you know how I got in here?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.980
I just wanted to warn that guy

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.030
and set his motorbike on fire.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.540
But the fire
accidentally spread to a house.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.920
Two people died.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.570
I know.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.080
I asked around.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.000
I really didn't mean to.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.620
I didn't know the fire would get that big.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.219
I'm so sorry to them.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.420
It already happened.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.800
You're paying the price

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.030
by serving time here.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.250
So reflect on it

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.100
and start over when you get out.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.750
Start over, my ass.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.889
They're dead. Can they come back to life?

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.670
By the way,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.860
the day I quit the team,

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:48.909
you ran over and told me

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.770
you only kept going because of me.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.120
Why did you say that?

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.940
Because you always stood back up.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.390
Wait.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.710
What do you mean?

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.660
I can always stand.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.160
You can't?

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.870
I mean, no matter
how strong the opponent was,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.010
no matter how badly you got kicked,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.480
you always got back up.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.260
So I thought

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.190
if you could keep going,

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.550
I definitely could too.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.950
I'm sorry

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.590
for ending your taekwondo career.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:43.850
Okay.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.140
I accept your apology.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.420
I feel like an idiot.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.260
Let me tell you.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.850
Since I got here, I've realized

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.510
anyone can start over

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.680
if they really put their mind to it.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.800
You're working in the kitchen now,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.170
learning a trade.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.430
You could be a chef when you get out.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.250
You mean your mom's sous-chef?

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.890
Sure.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.060
I really miss your mom's noodles.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.880
They smelled and tasted so good, right?

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:19.280
Gao Zhiyao! Where are you
delivering that food?

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.100
Report back to Central Control!

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.450
I'm on my way.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.490
Gotta go.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.830
Your letter.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.400
Don't overthink it.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.050
Sir,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.690
Tadpole needs
to go to the Health Division.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.560
Dispatch. Kitchen requests backup.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.660
Inmate 9416 is burned.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.460
He needs to go to the Health Division.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.410
Run cold water on it!

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.800
Go run cold water on it!

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.140
Hang in there.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.330
Hang in there.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.950
Zhang Yilong.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.040
How did you get hurt so badly?

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.170
We have to transfer him out.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.750
I've already called an ambulance.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.500
I need to ride along

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.870
because I can't handle this here.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.620
-Director.
-I think he's at risk of infection.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.370
How could you be so careless?

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.200
What are you doing here?

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.070
Get over here.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.520
I'll find someone for guard duty.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.060
Okay.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.390
Director, why find someone else?

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.320
I can go with him.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.180
You can't.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.560
Why?

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.120
He's my friend.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.410
I can take him there.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.420
That is exactly why you can't.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.500
Please, Director.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.770
Let me escort him, okay?

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.570
How can you guarantee anything?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.130
The ambulance is here.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.460
Anyone available to go?

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.060
Boss.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.580
The kitchen food truck
had a fender bender.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.250
Can you send some backup?

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.360
What's the situation?

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.890
It crashed into a transport truck.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.080
Alright, wait a sec. I'll be right there.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.200
Director, I really can do this.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.670
We're short-staffed. Please let me go.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.140
Trust me. I won't screw this up.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:09.930
I'll be careful.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.580
Then watch yourself.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.250
You are there to guard him.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.250
I know.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.500
Go.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:16.830
Thanks, Director.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.790
Ready to move.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:20.520
Okay.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.870
Okay, take him out first.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.890
I'll get the paperwork.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.220
Okay. Come on. Careful.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.050
Careful.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.710
[Emergency Room]

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.670
That's about it.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.110
Have you treated this before?

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.780
Yes.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.980
Follow these steps to change the dressing.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.010
If you can't handle it,
bring him back anytime.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.600
Okay.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.840
Thank you.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.240
-No problem.
-Thank you.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.730
Gao Zhiyao.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.250
I'm sorry.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.750
Why are you...

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.000
Don't come closer!

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.700
What are you doing?

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.410
Don't come closer!

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.110
Back off!

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.460
Tadpole, what are you doing?

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.760
-Tadpole, what are you doing?
-Back off!

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.800
Don't come closer, or I'll stab her.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.050
Tadpole, stop it.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.220
If you need help, just tell me, okay?

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.280
Calm down.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.280
I need to find my girlfriend.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.980
I want to tell her

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.490
I really didn't mean to do it.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.790
Why go look for her?

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.260
She'll come back to me.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.280
Just calm down first.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.110
Breaking up is a one-sided decision.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.600
I didn't break up with her!

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.750
Don't provoke him anymore!

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.580
Okay. Wait.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.130
There are plenty…

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.160
plenty of girls out there.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.710
Why get hung up on just one?

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.750
Don't imitate me!

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.750
Okay.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.230
Tadpole, calm down. Listen to me.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.620
You followed the rules before

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.620
just to get out early

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.680
and see her, right?

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.310
But you're ruining everything now!

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.960
All ruined!

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.310
I'm already ruined!

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.050
I'm an inmate! You're an officer!

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.800
Don't give me that crap!

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.780
Leave me alone! Back off!

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.120
Calm down!

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.420
Just calm down.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.590
Okay, listen to me.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.320
I'm the only one who can help you here.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320
Trust me, okay?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.760
I will find a way

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.460
to get your girlfriend here.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.750
I mean it. Trust me.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:51.370
I'll find a way

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.770
to get her to come see you.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.450
Xiaohui…

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.170
Jiajun!

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.900
Make a call.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.260
Notify Dr. Huang!

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.400
The gurney.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.640
Jiajun.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.540
Are you okay?

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.080
Xiaohui.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.250
Yeah?

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.370
You're okay?

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.130
I'm fine.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.250
Thank goodness.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.010
In the end...

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.440
I saved you, right?

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.600
Zhiyao saved me.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.920
Why was it him?

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.500
That's not how I imagined it.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.070
You were really cool just now.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.490
I was so charmed.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.550
Scared or charmed?

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.470
Smitten.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.840
That's good.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.340
You tased yourself on purpose

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.220
to distract Tadpole, right?

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.370
No.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.160
I didn't mean to tase myself.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.650
Alright.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.690
It's the first time

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.440
someone stood up for me like that.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.300
Does your head still hurt?

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.400
A little.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.730
Do you want to sleep a bit more?

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.140
Can you

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.910
stay with me a little longer?

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.710
I didn't say I was leaving.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.740
Go to sleep.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.370
No.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.350
[Diagnosis: Stage 4 Colon Cancer]

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.570
Boss, give me the trash.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.230
Don't take my stuff.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.320
Boss, isn't this trash?

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.450
I said don't take my stuff!
Don't you understand?

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.590
Don't take my stuff!
Do you understand?

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.220
-I'll give it back.
-Don't take my stuff!

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.050
Don't you understand?

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.400
Boss!

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.680
Don't you understand?

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.870
Enough!

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.930
Enough, Boss!

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.730
What are you doing?

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.060
Squat against the wall!

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:12.620
This is Zhongwen.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.150
Fight in Cell Block Harmony II.
I need backup.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.450
If something's wrong, tell me!

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.640
Shun! Come help! Hurry!

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.670
What's happening?

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.670
Calm down!

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.760
Shun!

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.450
Pull him away!

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.340
I'm pulling!
