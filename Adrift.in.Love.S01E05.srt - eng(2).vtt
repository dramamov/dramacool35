00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.445
Excuse me.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.072
Is Mr. Gu Hou Ze here?

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.707
Do you have an appointment?

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.047
Do we look sick?

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.376
It's you. You look sick.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.836
Let's meet at the same time next week.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.762
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Gu.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.260
How may I help you?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.928
Are you Gu Hou Ze?

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.604
Yes, that's me.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:03.445
Don't you think the debt should be settled?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.303
Goodness.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.715
Isn't your name all over these?

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.947
Call Ms. Fan first.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:43.019
I think a Ms. Fan borrowed money
from you under my name.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.697
But I'm not sure about the actual situation.

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:30.562
[Episode 5: Are we sick or is love twisted?]

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:43.747
Hello?

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:46.916
- Hello, is this Miss Fan Yue Jiao?
- Yes.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.419
I'm Commissioner Chen from Fubon Bank's
Foreign Exchange Department.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.130
Your foreign currency transaction
has been processed.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.341
Account details will be sent
to your email shortly.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.677
Please check it. Thank you.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.678
Okay, thank you.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.146
I'll contact you if I have any questions.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.903
I've compiled the results
of the past two years' art auctions.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.529
I found that this kind of abstract painting

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.449
is starting to attract collectors.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.912
Also, the Japanese New Generation
artists you've bought and sold

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.039
all seem to be of this type.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.373
Why don't you talk to them again?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.633
See if there are any new works.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.761
Okay.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.393
Are you okay?

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:49.187
Why don't we end here for today?

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.522
Mr. Zhan wants to have dinner with you
and asked me to book a restaurant.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.490
What kind of food do you want to eat?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.536
I'm going to the restroom.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.095
Director Qian, Vice President.
You're here to see the paintings, too?

00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.012
[Hou Ze]

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.216
Pan Xin Tong.

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:24.574
You're taking huge strides.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.034
Wow.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.578
You're so elegant now.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:32.665
I guess you've dipped your toes
into art sales and acquisitions, huh.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.500
It's no surprise.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.336
You're with Mr. Qian now.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:40.173
It's good for you to improve yourself.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.258
Excuse me, Vice President. I have to go.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.101
Don't be in a rush.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.222
I'm Yi Fu's uncle, after all.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.349
Here's the thing.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.601
If there's anything between you and Yi Fu,

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.186
you can share it with me.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.480
I have a lot of tips for you.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.773
Listen to me.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.400
Often, when it comes to relationships...

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.452
Vice President Qian, what's the matter?

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.323
Not at all.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.825
I'm just concerned about my employee...

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.995
my ex-employee's life.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.624
So, she won't be exploited by her current boss.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.376
Don't worry, Vice President Qian.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.795
She's doing very well here.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.972
Glad her talent hasn't been doomed
to obscurity at your place.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.385
We're done here, right?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.935
Let's go.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.605
Pan Xin Tong.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:34.026
Director Qian is looking for you.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.571
What's going on? Let me see.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.414
Let me see.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.202
What are you doing?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.829
Let go! Let go of him!

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.330
Let go of him!

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.331
Let go of him!

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:56.874
What are you doing?

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.418
Let go!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.460
Kill him!

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.046
Are you two going to pay the 40 million?

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:04.097
Why are you still standing there? Get lost!

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:07.051
Why did you borrow so much money?

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.594
Oh my.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.304
Mr. Gu.

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:11.806
I'm so sorry.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:15.309
Those punks didn't know better
and got you bruised.

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.729
Please don't hold a grudge.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.523
I don't have that much cash right now.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.109
You need to give me some time.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.236
Look at what you're saying.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:30.116
You have to show your sincerity today.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.409
How much do you need today?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.202
Gosh.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:35.830
Miss, are you paying for him?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.290
How much?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.174
Two million.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.630
Did you get in touch with Ms. Fan?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.674
No, but I texted her.

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:48.593
I'll try again.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.595
I'll find a way to pay you back
the two million.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.055
Why did you borrow so much money
from loan sharks?

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.724
I didn't.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.393
Ms. Fan borrowed it
under my company's name.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:00.396
I'm the person in charge,
so they came to collect from me.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.939
Cindy.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:04.650
Help me check how much money
we have left in the company.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.569
And the loans, too.

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:11.081
Didn't we disagree
on increasing the capital before?

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:15.286
So, you didn't know Ms. Fan borrowed money?

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.038
Don't let the other shareholders know yet.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.206
Just find it and give it to me.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.673
That's all for now.

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:27.389
By the way, why did you
come looking for me today?

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.543
It's nothing.

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:54.308
Director Qian, were you looking for me?

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.293
I don't like to beat around the bush.

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.837
I'll get straight to the point.

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.972
Please leave Yi Fu.

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.512
Have you asked Yi Fu for his opinion?

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.597
I've seen a lot of people like you.

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:19.566
Stop pretending in front of me.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.784
People like me?

00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:26.232
You know what I mean.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.651
Why do you have to humiliate yourself?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.154
Is this going to unfold like a TV drama?

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:35.658
Are you going to write me a check
for millions to get me to leave Yi Fu?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.369
I'm not as stupid as an idol drama heroine.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.670
I might really take it.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.250
You must think you're special.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.503
All of Yi Fu's girlfriends thought so, too.

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:50.298
But the result has been the same.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.341
If you don't break up now,

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:55.052
you'll still be dumped within three months.

00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:58.806
By then, you'll only hurt yourself more.

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:00.850
You should know.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.228
Yi Fu has never been in a relationship
for more than three months.

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:08.129
What makes you think you'll be any different?

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.777
This is between him and me.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.946
We'll handle it ourselves.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.949
As for you, your task should be

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.951
to listen to your son more.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.620
Respect him.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.705
Are you lecturing me?

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:23.914
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:26.542
If that's all you want to talk about,

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.177
I won't waste your time.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.901
Are you okay?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.611
I'm fine, but I was so scared.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.237
They even hit Dr. Gu.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.205
They hit Dr. Gu?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.292
Where's Dr. Gu?

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.336
- Dr. Gu left.
- Where did he go?

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.381
There was a Ms. Zhou Xiao Qi
who came for counseling.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.425
She came when Dr. Gu was beaten up.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.595
She said she could help pay the interest first.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.305
Dr. Gu left with her just now.

00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.724
Zhou Xiao Qi?

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.227
If it wasn't for her today, do you think
those gangsters would've let me off so easily?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.688
Answer me first.
Why are you still involved with her?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.898
- What other secrets do you have?
- Answer me first!

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:32.066
How much more did you borrow?

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:37.238
Coincidentally, she came to your rescue?

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:40.616
You wouldn't let me invest more,
so I took out a loan.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.577
- The bank refused, so I took a private loan.
- Have you thought they'd harass the clinic?

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:45.287
I've never let you worry about money.

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.123
- How are we going to run the business now?
- You'll be a famous doctor and writer.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.383
- And then you'll have affairs?
- Have you ever thought about that?

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.883
There's such a big trench now.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:00.469
Have you thought about how to fix it?

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.180
How are you going to pay back the money?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.832
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:03.832 --> 00:12:07.101
When I borrowed the money,
I didn't plan to pay it back.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.929
I've wired the money overseas.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:13.983
I've transferred it overseas.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.243
Fan Yue Jiao, are you crazy?

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:25.494
Let's go to New Zealand together.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.080
The money is enough for us to live on.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.708
Are you saying we should
give up everything here

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.085
and go live in New Zealand?

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.254
What are you thinking?

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.630
Are you crazy?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.466
You're the crazy one.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.801
- You can't leave her.
- Don't drag her into everything.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.470
She's the reason we're in this situation.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.981
You know very well
what our relationship is like.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:49.101
Okay.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.313
It's fine if you don't want
to go to New Zealand.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.985
But you know what's going on now, right?

00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:57.234
Those loan sharks will make the news.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:59.653
You'll be a joke, ruined.

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:02.455
Let's see what you can do then.

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:09.671
Yue Jiao.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.094
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.100
Wire the money back.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:30.734
You promised me we'd go
to New Zealand together.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.487
This time, we can finally go together.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.917
Spare me, please.

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.843
You love me.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.722
You've just temporarily forgotten.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.734
Here you go. This is for you.

00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:22.027
Do you want to order anything else?

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.737
We have a secret dish here.

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:25.322
It's not on the menu.

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:27.094
Chicken Feet Jelly.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.080
Are you tired of spicy hot pot?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.732
You were much more excited
last time you had it.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.762
I'm not hungry.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:42.840
You're not hungry?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.258
I saw you didn't eat much
at the restaurant earlier.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:46.302
That's why I wanted to have
spicy hot pot with you after work.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.637
Can you stop caring so much about me?

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:50.269
What did you say?

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.437
Why are you daydreaming?

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.314
The fried dough sticks are mushy.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.691
Didn't we agree on eight seconds?

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.450
What are you doing?

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:14.587
Let me ask you this.

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.258
Okay, go ahead.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.931
It's nothing.

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:33.669
What? What do you want to tell me?

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:39.237
Stop staring. Eat up.

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.123
You'll choke.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.503
What's wrong? Why are you so quiet today?

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.929
Why do you look so down?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.926
Let me ask you something.

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.719
Is it true that all your girlfriends

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:13.062
never lasted more than three months?

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.309
Why do you ask?

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.068
Do you like me?

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:22.489
Answer me first.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.859
I think when two people are dating,

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.070
they should end it at the best moment.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.788
That's the most beautiful.

00:16:31.372 --> 00:16:32.923
Oh.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:13.020
If we kiss, it'll have to
last more than three months.

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.720
Think carefully.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.048
This is the interest for this period.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.469
Sir, here's the money.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:17.930
- Don't lose it.
- Okay.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.773
You can take the book if you like it.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.313
Damn.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.815
I'm impressed.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.283
You're still a writer.

00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:34.042
"Reconciliation with the Self".

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:38.492
I have a problem.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.203
I'm always torturing myself.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.664
Looks like I need to read more of this book

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.152
to cultivate my soul.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.428
Can I have your autograph?

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.266
Oh, right.

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.768
Don't just reconcile with yourself.

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.186
You should pay us back as soon as possible.

00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.061
It's more important to settle with us.

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.953
Look, how about here?

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:24.712
If I don't get the money
the next time I'm here,

00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:28.125
I'll take this with me.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.842
It's a deal.

00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.637
Thank you for the book.

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.054
Did you come back from abroad recently?

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:43.724
Yes, I went to Japan, and then Thailand.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.684
Do you think I'm tanned?

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.060
No, I don't think so.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.319
I don't think so.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.732
Yes.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.324
Cheers.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.405
I'll treat everyone to a shot.

00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.865
That's great.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:03.084
Thank you, sir.

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.551
Let me.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.635
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.728
You will be charged after the beep.

00:21:06.812 --> 00:21:10.819
[Zhou Xiao Qi: How are you doing?]

00:21:10.819 --> 00:21:18.086
[Did those guys harass you again?]

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.970
The clinic is closed.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.604
I know.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:48.765
Where's Dr. Gu?

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:50.017
He's not here.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.776
Where is he?

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.030
New Zealand.

00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:01.077
We're moving to New Zealand for good.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:12.380
There's no need to call.
He won't answer your calls.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.292
He won't see you again.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:17.385
Just give up.

00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:22.014
Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable.

00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:42.652
Where is he?

00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:44.154
Sorry, the number you dialed...

00:22:44.154 --> 00:22:46.156
- His phone is with me.
- ...is unavailable.

00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:48.166
Please try again later.

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:54.338
Don't glare at me.

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.924
Show yourself out.

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:48.385
I went to your house. I wanted to tell you...

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:51.229
Are you going to New Zealand with Fan Yue Jiao?

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:05.284
She's threatening me with money.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.747
I'll go with her first.

00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.959
I'll try to get the money back.

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:20.125
Don't go.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.419
If you go, you won't come back.

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:24.553
It's such a mess now.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.467
There's nothing I can do.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.535
I'll find a way to send you
the money I owe you.

00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.798
I've never been a choice to you, have I?

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:05.636
This is the best decision for everyone.

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:10.808
Please take good care of yourself.

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:16.181
Do you love Fan Yue Jiao more than you love me?

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.584
Is that it?

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.030
I'm sorry.

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:28.743
Is that your answer?

00:25:29.444 --> 00:25:31.412
Gu Hou Ze!

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:16.116
Why are you out in the rain?

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:18.334
Come in.

00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:21.871
Why are you looking for me?

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:23.582
I have something important to tell you.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.841
Sit down first.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.008
Xiao Qi.

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.309
You're pregnant.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.472
It was confirmed during the last check-up.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:43.018
I'm just as shocked as you.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.438
I thought we'd need
medical technology to have a child.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:49.031
But it really happened.

00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:53.317
Wait a minute.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:10.094
Xiao Qi, will you marry me?

00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:13.840
You can plan the wedding as you please.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.010
And I want to give you a grand wedding gift.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.721
Just tell me what you want.

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.507
I'll definitely agree.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.494
Hello?

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.753
When are you leaving?

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.550
This afternoon.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.720
I want to meet you now.

00:28:04.974 --> 00:28:07.560
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.029
You will be charged after the beep.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.188
Yue Jiao.

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.046
Yue Jiao.

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:10.673
Why did you let me in here?

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.387
Can you do me a favor?

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:40.661
Can you change into this?

00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:45.040
These are Shu Juan's clothes.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:49.336
Today is the second anniversary
of her and Xiao An's passing.

00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:53.291
I can't believe a car accident

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:56.135
took them both away from me.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:03.507
Sure.

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:23.412
When Shu Juan was around,

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.492
we used to go dancing a lot.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.418
Those days...

00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:32.254
were truly wonderful.

00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.957
You didn't bring an umbrella again, did you?

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:11.168
I'll give you a ride.

00:31:15.623 --> 00:31:18.133
You can take my car. I'll give you a ride.

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:25.174
Haven't we decided to be friends?

00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:28.261
Please don't keep doing things
that'll cause misunderstandings.

00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:29.804
What do you mean by that?

00:31:29.804 --> 00:31:30.984
But it's raining heavily.

00:31:30.984 --> 00:31:32.473
Take my car. I'll give you a ride.

00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:34.358
Don't overthink it.

00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.764
Get in the car. You're all wet.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.349
I want to take the bus.

00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:16.184
Why take the bus when I can drive you?

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.769
I love taking the bus.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.695
Your car is uncomfortable.

00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:25.044
Fuck.

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:32.909
Can you stop being so difficult?

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:35.169
I'm not as casual as you.

00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:40.458
I may have only dated for a short time,

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.543
but I've never cheated.

00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:43.920
Isn't that great?

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.588
You only date for three months.

00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:47.306
It's just a fling.

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:58.317
How long do you want it to last?

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.439
Sir.

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:06.776
It's normal for relationships
to have ups and downs.

00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.988
I'm not someone who needs it to last forever.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.615
Who sets a time limit like that?

00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:14.492
Then don't set one.

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.744
Let's just try to be together.

00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:18.918
We'll see how long it lasts.

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:26.838
Let's date.

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.244
What do you think?

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:39.267
How can you say that so casually?

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:41.644
Who knows if you're serious or not?

00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:43.062
I'm not made of time.

00:33:43.062 --> 00:33:46.156
Why would I put in so much effort
to lie to you?

00:33:49.944 --> 00:33:53.489
So, you're willing to bend
your principles for me?

00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:56.084
You seemed really reluctant before.

00:33:57.243 --> 00:34:00.580
I was figuring out what I should do.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.791
I thought I'd talk to you
when I'd made up my mind.

00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:06.127
Besides, it was so awkward between us.

00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:07.761
How could I speak my mind?

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:11.090
You didn't say anything.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.885
Of course I'd think you were avoiding me.

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.863
I rushed back because
I didn't want you to think that way.

00:34:19.932 --> 00:34:22.602
I met some farmers when I was
on a business trip in the south.

00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:25.480
They were growing the flowers they bred.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.858
The flowers wither in three months.

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:30.693
The farmers also said,

00:34:30.693 --> 00:34:34.489
"It's better to keep a wonderful past."

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.782
When I heard them say that,

00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:38.743
I suddenly felt sad.

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.747
That was when I thought of you.

00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:49.261
I don't think I want to
end it in three months with you.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.803
It just so happens that it's also three months?

00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.562
You're bluffing, right?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:06.104
Yes, I'm bluffing.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.530
The gist is...

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.743
I miss you.

00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:21.710
You blabbered on and on...

00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:25.172
But the summary was way more romantic.

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.019
So, do you agree?

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:50.606
When you promised it'll last
more than three months...

00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:52.975
you didn't mean just four months, right?

00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:59.282
When you turn 40,

00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:01.826
I'll still celebrate your birthday with you.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:05.246
Happy birthday to you.

00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:06.622
What?

00:36:06.622 --> 00:36:07.999
Louder, I can't hear you.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:11.085
Happy birthday to you.

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:13.387
Happy birthday!

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.090
When you turn 50,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.842
I'll still celebrate your birthday with you.

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.560
Happy birthday!

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:23.944
I've blown out the candles.

00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:26.984
Can I make a wish now?

00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:31.488
What do you want to wish for?

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:40.580
Can I stick my tongue in?

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.335
Xiao Qi, you're so pretty today.

00:37:28.454 --> 00:37:30.080
Thank you.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.344
But you'll look prettier if you smile.

00:37:38.005 --> 00:37:40.012
I'll smile later.

00:38:16.088 --> 00:38:18.629
What is it that needs to be said in person?

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.094
If the debts can be paid off,

00:39:19.148 --> 00:39:21.992
will you stay and turn your life
upside-down with me?

00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:46.558
I'm pregnant.

00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:51.855
It's your child.

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:19.375
Xiao Qi, we...

00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:48.049
Let's go.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.645
This is the best solution
I've come up with so far.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.057
Is this another form of revenge?

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:19.143
After I marry him,
he'll give me a sum of money.

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.853
It can temporarily pay off your debts.

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:23.905
You won't have to leave. You can stay.

00:41:24.735 --> 00:41:26.328
Stay?

00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:30.070
The marriage is just a show.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.257
Once your debts are paid off,
I'll take our child and leave him.

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.838
Your idea is too naive.

00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:44.050
It's not an idea.

00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.132
It's what I've decided.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:55.312
Do you like it when I'm so naive?

00:42:03.646 --> 00:42:07.216
I've never been a choice to you, have I?

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:11.499
This is the best decision for everyone.

00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:30.024
Fine, Old Wu can give a speech.

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:34.111
But even Chairman Fu
and Chairman Kang wanted air time.

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:36.204
They never have anything interesting to say.

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:48.125
What's wrong? Are you tired?

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.711
Of course, I've been smiling all day.

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:52.921
It's only one day of exhaustion.

00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:53.964
From now on,

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:57.384
you can just relax and be the chairman's wife.

00:43:57.384 --> 00:44:01.187
And have a healthy baby.

00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:05.559
By the way, I've appointed a driver for you.

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.437
You're pregnant now. Don't drive.

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:11.357
But my job requires me to travel.
That'll be inconvenient.

00:44:11.357 --> 00:44:13.859
Your status is different now.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:16.737
Driving that small car around?

00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:20.040
What would others say about me?

00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.209
The will and the transfer of trust

00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:32.503
has been amended as per your instructions.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.554
Please take a look.

00:44:35.714 --> 00:44:39.350
If there are no issues, please sign it.

00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:52.918
[Zhan Qian Ren]

00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:58.195
Thank you, Attorney Ren.

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.528
It's my pleasure.

00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:11.854
Are you going out?

00:45:11.854 --> 00:45:13.836
To a consultation.

00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:15.655
Haven't you been sleeping better lately?

00:45:15.655 --> 00:45:16.964
You still have sessions?

00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:19.842
I'll feel better if I talk to the doctor.

00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:21.802
I'm glad it helps.

00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:24.805
Your mood is most important now.

00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.473
Ask the driver to take you.

00:45:26.473 --> 00:45:28.650
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:01.975
Qian Ren got me a driver.

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:08.188
I think he wants to
keep an eye on us. Be careful.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.364
I don't know how long this will last.

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.076
Yeah.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.916
The baby kicked me.

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.454
That's too soon.

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.933
The baby's really kicking me.

00:46:31.933 --> 00:46:33.582
Feel it if you don't believe me.

00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:35.008
Here.

00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.377
Do you feel it?

00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:40.047
Here. Do you feel it?

00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:42.089
You must've eaten too much ice cream.

00:46:42.089 --> 00:46:43.759
Your stomach is bloated.

00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:45.928
- It's rumbling.
- The baby really kicked me.

00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:47.346
Why don't you believe me?

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:49.731
Yes, I feel it.

00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:17.626
Why are you here?

00:47:17.626 --> 00:47:19.927
Mr. Zhan asked me to...

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.798
You forgot your phone.

00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:24.474
Thank you.

00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:29.805
Hello, Dr. Gu. I'm a fan of yours.

00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:31.496
I've read all your books.

00:47:31.496 --> 00:47:33.225
They encouraged me greatly.

00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:34.476
Thank you.

00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:36.728
Make an appointment with the receptionist
for our next session.

00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.138
Okay.

00:47:43.777 --> 00:47:45.745
Why are you here?

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:48.740
Mr. Zhan said to change the family registry.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.034
We need your ID and seal.

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:52.369
I asked the driver and he said you were here.

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.495
- That's why I'm here.
- Ask me directly next time.

00:47:53.495 --> 00:47:55.303
Don't ask the driver.

00:49:36.848 --> 00:49:38.850
Who let you take Shu Juan's stuff?

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.570
I...

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.784
Zhan Qian Ren!
