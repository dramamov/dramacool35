[Tide of Love]

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.430
Yeah.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.530
Extend the contract for a month.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.960
What? A month?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.130
You never let anyone stay beyond a day.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.890
Always a one-off deal.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.600
But a month this time?

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.830
Don't tell me

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.760
you have

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.860
feelings for him?

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.430
Don't do what you'll regret.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.460
It's not too late to let go now.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.000
Jaehun.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.130
Minwoo is right.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.960
You...

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.130
never genuinely fall for anyone.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.590
Crushes and flirting
are just to stave off boredom,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.120
and you have situationships
left and right.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.160
You've always been so casual

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.390
and unfazed with love.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.030
So...

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.790
why is it different this time?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.160
Why does your heart waver
when you see Haejun?

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.590
The way Haejun eats bread,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.430
the way he smiles...

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.530
He is always on your mind.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.100
Jaehun.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.329
You're calm and rational in business.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.790
How can a college student fluster you?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.100
He's breaking all your rules.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.460
Please.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.160
Jaehun.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.560
This crush

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.730
will hurt you in the end.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.260
Please.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.060
Don't do this.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.530
Hey, Kim Haejun.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.060
Look at me.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.130
What have you been up to lately?

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.760
You don't answer my calls

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.890
or respond to texts.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.190
What's going on?

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.230
What part-time job changes you like this?

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.900
I'm just...

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.060
teaching children art in my neighborhood.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.960
What was that for?

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.659
It was getting interesting.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.130
Quiet.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.690
Speak with your mouth.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.930
Are you crazy?

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.930
You're good with your mouth.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.090
One penalty point.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.460
Two.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.900
Three.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.660
Four.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.660
The last button.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.900
Time for the punishment.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.660
It's my rule.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.730
I am your master,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.030
and you obey me.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.100
Eat it.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.630
Sorry, I'm going to be late for school.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.530
The professor won't let me off...

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.560
I'll call you tonight.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.720
I have to go. Sorry!

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.030
He'll come running back again soon.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.700
Like a habit.
