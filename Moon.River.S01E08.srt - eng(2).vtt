00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:13.155
(Moon River)

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:15.125
Please kill me!

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:17.125
Gladly.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.825
I will kill every last one of you!

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:26.735
The Queen Dowager has arrived!

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:32.135
You dared to conspire against the Royal Relatives...

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.675
and bring harm to the Crown Prince.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.015
- Arrest this traitor. - Harming His Royal Highness was...

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:40.945
the fault of my subordinate.

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:43.985
And I had proof of the affair.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.985
That love letter... The Crown Prince wrote it to Park Dal.

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:52.655
- What are you doing? Seize her now. - Arrest her immediately!

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:53.795
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:58.195
I have been wronged.

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:01.665
Your Majesty, I have been wronged!

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:04.305
Your Majesty, I have been wronged.

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:31.565
The letter you brought as proof of an affair...

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.495
was confirmed that it was written by His Highness, the Crown Prince.

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:36.965
So what brings you here now?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.475
There is no place in this place for you, Grand Prince Je Un.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:43.005
Therefore, you must leave.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.115
Did you not know? I already live outside the palace.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:50.085
Then, I shall return to my home.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.664
Left State Councillor. Please give me one more chance.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.065
I will not fail you this time!

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.404
- My lord! - Careless words...

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.635
can bring great harm.

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:15.705
(Chapter Eight: Silence is Golden)

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:23.185
Your Royal Highness, let a court lady do that.

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:24.985
I will do it myself.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:27.455
I will do it.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:30.385
And what should I do with Court Lady Park's things?

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.025
Get rid of them.

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.965
- She will not need them anymore. - What do you mean?

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.705
Then should I get rid of this scent pouch too?

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.475
Leave that.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:51.945
It is evidence that the man behind the Choraengi Mask dropped.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.945
But this scent pouch...

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.315
Last year,

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:57.984
His Majesty gave these to palace staff...

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.285
to celebrate Queen Dowager's birthday.

00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:02.885
How could the man behind the Choraengi Mask have one?

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.825
What? Palace staff?

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:08.025
This is the entry and exit log...

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:09.825
of the palace staff's from the last six months.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:14.335
But why did you have me bring this?

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.335
We could have just inspected all of the staff's scent pouches.

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.235
This scent pouch is his?

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.845
Scent pouches are typically used by women.

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:33.815
The Choraengi Mask?

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:35.825
A sack?

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:39.325
Five.

00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:44.265
One.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.165
Once every five days.

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:53.935
You traded poisonous insects with the Choraengi Mask.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:55.345
Is that correct?

00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:58.415
Find a court lady...

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:00.615
who left between 9pm and 1am every 5 days.

00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:02.845
This...

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:04.315
You want me to search through all of this?

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:07.755
This is tyranny and an abuse of power.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:11.055
It is not an abuse of power when the Crown Prince does it.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:12.495
Besides,

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:16.225
you would rather be looking through this log...

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:18.795
than at your name in the death book, would you not?

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:25.805
(Jo Myeong Im)

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:28.875
(Jo Myeong Im)

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:38.715
Over the past 3 months, once every 5 days,

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:42.225
only one person left regularly at 9pm or 1am.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.665
Where is the Chief Court Lady now?

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:09.545
This was found in the Chief Court Lady's quarters.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:13.185
So the Chief Court Lady really was the Choraengi Mask.

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:21.625
The Left State Councillor's blade...

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:23.725
knows no hesitation.

00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:27.065
Tell the Police Bureau to watch the snake catchers.

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:29.735
He will need to procure food for the Jimjo,

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:32.935
so he will be looking for new catchers.

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.175
If we move on them without reason,

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:36.975
the Left State Councillor will not approve.

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:40.515
Yes, that is too rash. If you could please reconsider...

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:41.585
There is...

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:44.815
There is no time.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:48.725
I must end this before the Left State Councillor harms Dal.

00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:52.025
I have to do something!

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.605
It is mine.

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:13.245
It is mine.

00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:37.135
This...

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.405
I received this before I entered the palace.

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:44.405
This one thing...

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:48.445
is mine.

00:06:50.985 --> 00:06:51.985
Dal.

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.815
Dal, are you all right? Dal.

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:57.485
Dal, are you all right?

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.495
This will not do. I will go get the Royal Physician.

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:13.175
Why am I here?

00:07:13.205 --> 00:07:15.305
Have we not switched back?

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:21.745
Here, calm down and look. It is my face.

00:07:33.855 --> 00:07:34.925
But...

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:38.365
how did we switch back then?

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.065
I am not sure either.

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:45.135
When I came to after being whipped, we had already switched back.

00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:52.375
When we switched bodies before, we were not whipped.

00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.515
Still, it is a relief...

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:00.355
that we have switched back.

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:03.785
How can you be smiling right now?

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:05.455
What do you want me to do?

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:08.525
- I had to save you. - Who asked you to save me?

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:13.995
Since I got tangled up with you, I have not had a moment's peace.

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:16.335
And do you have any idea how many times I nearly died?

00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:20.605
I cannot stand to see you like this by my side.

00:08:26.015 --> 00:08:27.115
In any case,

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:29.645
we agreed I would leave once we switched back.

00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:31.715
Who said you could leave?

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:38.085
I am going to make you my concubine.

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:42.925
I have to keep you in my sight.

00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:46.735
I need to keep you close so I know you are safe.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:48.765
From now on,

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:50.665
I will be your shield,

00:08:51.935 --> 00:08:53.175
and you will hide behind me.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:57.745
Until that shield is broken.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:08.255
I told you to stay at my chambers. Why did you insist on coming here?

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:13.155
You were just dying for your silk bed, were you not?

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:17.265
Now that you have switched back, you can enjoy it all you want.

00:09:19.165 --> 00:09:22.465
As if there is only one silk bed in this whole palace.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:55.835
Here. I hope this eases your pain, even just a little.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:04.745
You are in no condition to be up. Lie down. I will leave you to rest.

00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:18.055
Actually...

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:19.425
Yes? What is it?

00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:22.365
- Is there something you need? - No, that is not it.

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:24.495
It is just something I was wondering.

00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:28.365
It is about...

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:31.035
that Four Frames of Life painting.

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:33.005
What?

00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:34.735
Why did you put it in that love letter?

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:39.975
You know,

00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:42.645
the one that goes, "The night is dark, and the moon is bright."

00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:46.085
Or whatever. That one.

00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:48.925
In a letter so cheesy,

00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:53.455
why did you tuck in a drawing...

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:56.395
of the two of us?

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:05.735
That is...

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:07.935
The thing is...

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:22.925
The Left State Councillor will make bolder attempts to harm Dal.

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:25.495
Instead of a hasty confession,

00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:28.025
taking down the Left State Councillor must come first.

00:11:33.595 --> 00:11:35.435
There was nowhere else to put it.

00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:42.205
Then I guess...

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:43.844
you are making me a Royal Concubine...

00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:44.945
because there is nowhere else for me.

00:11:45.315 --> 00:11:47.714
You must stay by my side until I find evidence...

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:49.285
and take down the Left State Councillor.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.685
You were hurt because of me,

00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:53.855
so I have to take responsibility.

00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:12.635
What am I, bruised fruit?

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:15.775
Or a cracked pot?

00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:18.975
And what is all this about making me a concubine because I got hurt?

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:23.885
And what about "until I take down the Left State Councillor" part?

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:27.285
Once you are done with him, will you just toss me aside too?

00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:30.855
And I thought maybe his heart...

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:34.695
was for me, not the Crown Princess.

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:38.265
Talk about counting my chickens before they hatched.

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.435
It really stings.

00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:50.175
Goodness.

00:12:52.915 --> 00:12:55.045
Why on earth am I hurting inside and out?

00:12:56.585 --> 00:12:57.585
This is just miserable.

00:12:58.285 --> 00:12:59.385
A Royal Concubine?

00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:02.024
Do you think the Left State Councillor will just sit by...

00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:03.625
if you bring in a concubine before the Royal Wedding?

00:13:03.885 --> 00:13:06.295
I am no longer afraid of the Left State Councillor.

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:09.695
He would kill his own people without a second thought.

00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:12.535
I must protect Dal.

00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:15.135
This time, I swear...

00:13:17.365 --> 00:13:18.875
I will protect her at all costs.

00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:30.745
Please help me.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.455
Father.

00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:44.625
Your Majesty.

00:13:48.635 --> 00:13:50.935
What parent can ever win against their child?

00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:04.285
I hereby appoint Park Dal...

00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:08.055
as Crown Prince's Concubine of the Junior Fifth Rank.

00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:26.835
From this day forward, this girl will be attending to you.

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:31.145
I am Yeon Sim of the Hong clan. I will serve you devotedly.

00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:34.515
Thank you. I'm counting on you too.

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:39.215
You must address her informally. To do otherwise is against protocol.

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:40.985
But we have only just met.

00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:44.385
How can you say that when I brought your former roommate?

00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:49.095
I see.

00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:52.235
Right, right.

00:14:52.595 --> 00:14:53.765
But...

00:14:54.195 --> 00:14:57.435
why are you suddenly speaking with an accent?

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:00.335
It is just...

00:15:02.775 --> 00:15:04.005
Your Royal Highness.

00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:10.185
Well,

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.215
did you sleep well?

00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:13.515
Yes.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.085
I did.

00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:23.925
You have...

00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:26.535
put your hair up.

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:28.495
Oh, my hair...

00:15:29.805 --> 00:15:30.805
Yes.

00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:37.105
Does it look strange?

00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:39.045
No, it is just...

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:44.885
It looks good on you.

00:15:55.195 --> 00:15:58.895
Your Royal Highness.

00:16:01.095 --> 00:16:02.435
- What is it? - Hurry.

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:04.035
What is all the fuss about? What is it?

00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:18.985
- Your Royal Highness. - What has happened here?

00:16:19.085 --> 00:16:21.815
Poisonous insects were found in the jar, Your Highness.

00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:23.924
They are from the medicinal food merchants,

00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:25.755
so perhaps there was a mix-up.

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:27.655
I will launch an investigation at once.

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:29.295
Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:31.165
Who manages the deliveries from the merchant guilds?

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.035
The previous Chief Court Lady was in charge of it.

00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:40.635
Where are you going?

00:16:40.705 --> 00:16:43.805
If its food has appeared, then the creature must be here too.

00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:45.715
Do you have any idea where it could be?

00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:52.755
A place known only to the Chief Court Lady.

00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:56.855
Somewhere dark and damp within the palace.

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:05.425
No way. This tiny little thing is the Jimjo?

00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:08.265
It is a fledgling.

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:11.805
- We have to find the mother. - Now we have found its young,

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:14.505
will this not be enough to implicate the Left State Councillor?

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.445
The log, the feather from her room, and now this secret cell.

00:17:19.045 --> 00:17:22.445
It all fits a little too perfectly that she is the owner of the Jimjo.

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:23.685
That is true.

00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:26.255
There is no evidence linking her to the Left State Councillor.

00:17:26.385 --> 00:17:27.585
This Jimjo chick...

00:17:28.285 --> 00:17:30.055
is a taunt and a warning from the Left State Councillor.

00:17:31.655 --> 00:17:34.555
So he planned to use her as a scapegoat from the beginning.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:35.665
What is more,

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:40.095
it is a warning to stop digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:54.675
As you commanded, I have made sure all the evidence...

00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:56.085
points to the Chief Court Lady as the owner.

00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:01.215
The entry log, the feather in her quarters,

00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:04.185
and the Jimjo's food have all been planted.

00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:07.195
By now,

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:11.095
our dear Crown Prince must be quite confused.

00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:16.305
But is it really okay for the Crown Prince to have found the Jimjo?

00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:19.375
Since the Jimjo was found inside the palace,

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:22.705
he will not be so quick to reveal its existence.

00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:25.305
More importantly,

00:18:27.175 --> 00:18:30.745
I ordered you to kill everyone involved with my Jimjo.

00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:33.315
How does the Crown Prince know about you?

00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:35.755
Why is he checking snake catchers?

00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:45.125
Did a dead man start talking? Is that it?

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:49.505
Is someone I had killed still alive? Is that what happened?

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:51.865
Please kill me.

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.205
Do not disappoint me again.

00:18:57.975 --> 00:19:01.615
Your mother deserves to be free, does she not?

00:19:02.145 --> 00:19:04.345
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:08.915
A Jimjo chick was found inside the palace.

00:19:09.185 --> 00:19:12.495
Do you know a way to use the chick to find its mother?

00:19:12.795 --> 00:19:14.855
How could a Jimjo chick have come from the palace?

00:19:19.135 --> 00:19:22.435
- Why are you looking at me? - Only you speak Qing, Highness.

00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:24.005
What makes you think I can speak their language?

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.675
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:28.805
Well...

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:30.675
I picked some up here and there.

00:19:36.815 --> 00:19:39.915
Hey, last time we met, I noticed you can speak Joseon,

00:19:40.315 --> 00:19:41.555
so just speak in Joseon.

00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:45.525
Why must I yield to you as the Crown Prince? I have my pride.

00:19:47.255 --> 00:19:50.925
Your Royal Highness, he might change his mind anytime.

00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:52.795
You should set aside your pride for now...

00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:55.595
and get the information we need first.

00:19:56.605 --> 00:19:59.405
- No, I mean... - The chick...

00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.905
- The chick? - It cannot kill people.

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:03.904
That is why its mother protects it.

00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:05.005
I see.

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.545
Its venom is weak, so the mother protects it.

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:10.685
Is he talking about maternal instinct?

00:20:11.015 --> 00:20:12.715
A long time ago, a chick was sold far away.

00:20:13.315 --> 00:20:15.925
Its mother found it and brought it back home.

00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:17.955
Home? You mean...

00:20:19.325 --> 00:20:21.095
It would return to the place it was confined?

00:20:41.075 --> 00:20:42.445
A homing instinct?

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:48.985
You said it was sold far away. How far exactly?

00:20:51.585 --> 00:20:52.595
The next village over.

00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:54.795
About 8km.

00:20:57.325 --> 00:20:58.665
About 8km?

00:21:00.035 --> 00:21:01.165
What is it, Your Highness?

00:21:01.565 --> 00:21:03.835
For the mother to fetch its chick from 8km away,

00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:07.505
it must have heard the chick's cries and come for it.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.105
Which means...

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:13.115
the chick should be able to hear its mother's cries too.

00:21:19.455 --> 00:21:22.955
For now, our best bet is to use the chick to find its mother.

00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:27.125
Since adult Jimjo birds are large and usually kept in mountain caves,

00:21:27.455 --> 00:21:28.755
we will search the nearby mountains...

00:21:34.765 --> 00:21:36.035
Wait a moment.

00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:38.705
I need to speak with her.

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:45.705
You promised to send Dal away when your bodies switched.

00:21:45.815 --> 00:21:47.275
But now she is a Royal Concubine?

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:51.845
Did I not tell you? I told you you could not protect Dal!

00:21:54.155 --> 00:21:55.655
Something has felt off all along.

00:21:56.255 --> 00:21:58.054
The fact that you planned to flee to Qing when I, the Crown Prince,

00:21:58.055 --> 00:21:59.825
promised I would protect Dal.

00:22:00.455 --> 00:22:03.764
You believed that absurd tale about our bodies switching.

00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:04.825
And now,

00:22:05.935 --> 00:22:09.135
your desperate attempts to keep me and Dal apart.

00:22:18.345 --> 00:22:20.245
Just like with the Crown Princess five years ago,

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.885
do you want to lose Dal to the Left State Councillor as well?

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:29.185
I am begging you, let Dal go.

00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:34.555
Dal...

00:22:36.995 --> 00:22:39.265
said she is tired of living on the run.

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:43.565
And I will protect her this time, no matter what.

00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:47.175
Both Dal and her dreams.

00:22:57.115 --> 00:22:58.245
A Crown Prince's concubine?

00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:00.785
With the Royal Wedding just days away,

00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:02.085
he is taking a concubine?

00:23:03.185 --> 00:23:07.555
He defies you, Left State Councillor!

00:23:07.695 --> 00:23:11.695
How can you be so calm? What if she bears him a son?

00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:13.865
Is there anyone more troublesome...

00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:16.865
than the firstborn son of a Royal Concubine?

00:23:18.235 --> 00:23:19.405
Just wait and see.

00:23:20.475 --> 00:23:24.745
After all, there is no stronger leash than a weakness.

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:29.985
- Your Highness! Left State... - Unbelievable.

00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:32.984
He has tossed propriety to the dogs, has he not?

00:23:32.985 --> 00:23:35.285
Your Royal Highness, this is not about propriety now.

00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:37.154
It is the Left State Councillor.

00:23:37.155 --> 00:23:40.495
With Concubine Park... He is...

00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:46.965
We meet again, Lady Park.

00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:50.205
Left State Councillor. What brings you all the way here?

00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:53.675
I came to apologise for my rudeness during the recent interrogation...

00:23:54.135 --> 00:23:56.545
and to congratulate you on becoming a Royal Concubine.

00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:59.005
And for a few other reasons.

00:23:59.945 --> 00:24:02.815
- I also had something to confirm. - Confirm what?

00:24:09.155 --> 00:24:10.485
That is all right.

00:24:11.355 --> 00:24:13.125
I have already confirmed what I needed to.

00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:17.965
Your Royal Highness.

00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:30.575
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:24:32.475 --> 00:24:35.515
To what do we owe the honour, Your Royal Highness?

00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:41.554
A state councillor meeting the Royal Concubine alone...

00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:42.724
in broad daylight...

00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:44.955
I was worried it might cause talk, so I came.

00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:48.955
I am moved by Your Royal Highness's concern for me,

00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:51.065
I could weep.

00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:56.865
Lady Park, you may leave us.

00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:58.965
Pardon?

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:10.645
Yes, Your Highness.

00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:26.035
Then I, too, shall take my leave.

00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:29.405
But, Your Royal Highness.

00:25:30.235 --> 00:25:34.935
Why take on another weakness with that soft heart of yours?

00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:38.075
What do you...

00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:42.115
A person's greatest weakness is love.

00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:44.745
Did I not tell you so?

00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:49.185
I shall take my leave.

00:25:49.655 --> 00:25:54.025
I lost the Crown Princess, and with her, my laughter and love.

00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:56.625
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

00:25:57.825 --> 00:26:01.535
As you know, Lady Park saved my life at Sinjusa.

00:26:02.065 --> 00:26:04.105
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:06.205
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

00:26:13.775 --> 00:26:16.885
It seems you thought you found a way to protect her from me,

00:26:17.785 --> 00:26:19.515
but instead, you have only been exposed.

00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:24.925
I am talking about your affection, which you concealed with this lie.

00:26:43.475 --> 00:26:45.575
What were you thinking, going to him because he summoned you?

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:48.015
Have you already forgotten why you became a concubine?

00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:53.355
How could I forget? You remind me every chance you get.

00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:57.955
Fine.

00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:01.695
I will just hole up in this pavilion so I do not get in your way.

00:27:06.695 --> 00:27:08.035
Just bear with it for a little longer.

00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:10.405
I am slowly making progress.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.405
You just met with the boy from Qing, did you not?

00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:17.245
What did he say? Is he still refusing to talk?

00:27:18.845 --> 00:27:21.215
It seems the chick and its mother communicate over long distances.

00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:23.685
Since the birds are originally from the high mountains,

00:27:23.945 --> 00:27:27.985
it is a plausible theory. The hunters died within three days.

00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:31.225
The bird must be within a three-day round trip from the capital.

00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:34.495
Then it is highly likely it is inside the capital.

00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:36.824
He hid it for five years,

00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:38.795
so it is somewhere tied to the Left State Councillor.

00:27:39.735 --> 00:27:42.865
I will narrow down the locations and use the chick to find its mother.

00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:44.565
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:47.905
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:50.005
he will be finished for treason.

00:27:50.445 --> 00:27:53.215
- Great. What should I do? - Nothing!

00:27:54.445 --> 00:27:56.745
Now that I have my body back, this revenge is mine and mine alone.

00:27:57.285 --> 00:27:59.015
Forget half. You are not even getting a sliver.

00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:02.455
So, from now on, stay out of the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:04.625
If you were not going to let me in on it,

00:28:05.085 --> 00:28:07.395
then why did you explain the plan in such detail?

00:28:07.495 --> 00:28:08.955
It was not a plan. It was an explanation.

00:28:09.325 --> 00:28:11.295
That I will finish my revenge myself without your help...

00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:12.935
and take down the Left State Councillor.

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:16.765
Because I...

00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:19.305
have staked my life on this revenge.

00:28:30.515 --> 00:28:33.815
If you give your life for someone who is already dead,

00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:37.055
you will just end up with two dead people.

00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.755
The living are meant to live.

00:28:42.495 --> 00:28:43.525
Idiot.

00:28:46.735 --> 00:28:49.965
The Crown Prince's Concubine will be the Deposed Crown Princess.

00:28:50.435 --> 00:28:54.335
But many have already seen her body. How can we...

00:28:54.605 --> 00:28:57.505
What they saw was a corpse, decayed beyond recognition.

00:28:58.475 --> 00:29:02.615
Public opinion is more powerful than evidence.

00:29:04.085 --> 00:29:06.855
People lose their lives over false accusations of adultery,

00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:10.725
and a poisoning can be twisted into a curse.

00:29:11.525 --> 00:29:16.365
So why would they not believe someone dead is now alive?

00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:21.835
I will reach the concubine's neighbours in Boryeong.

00:29:25.635 --> 00:29:29.235
Here are the mountains within three days of the capital.

00:29:32.045 --> 00:29:34.315
They must have hidden it somewhere difficult to find.

00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:37.845
- The chick can lead us to its mom. - Yes.

00:29:38.215 --> 00:29:40.515
Still, we have come a long way.

00:29:40.785 --> 00:29:44.125
When you think about it, it is thanks to Prince Je Un's book.

00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:47.055
My apologies, Your Highness.

00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:50.095
Do not be.

00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:53.095
It is not like you are wrong.

00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:58.505
I am glad you know Choraengi Mask is the Chief Court Lady.

00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:02.135
I have felt awful this whole time that I could not be of any help.

00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:03.905
Why are you not calling me out?

00:30:06.815 --> 00:30:10.645
You should ask why I took everything and then ignored our promise.

00:30:10.915 --> 00:30:13.315
You should be yelling at me, calling me a coward and a jerk.

00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:16.725
Your silence makes me want to fight with you for no reason.

00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:19.055
What are you talking about?

00:30:20.725 --> 00:30:23.625
The Choraengi Mask's identity and that the Jimjo is alive...

00:30:23.895 --> 00:30:25.995
I discovered all of that thanks to the book you wrote.

00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:29.835
I got something out of it too, so we are even for you deceiving me.

00:30:31.005 --> 00:30:32.305
And since we made a promise,

00:30:33.405 --> 00:30:35.005
I will guarantee the Crown Princess Consort's safety.

00:30:40.115 --> 00:30:43.145
- Thank you, Gang! - Get off me. That is disgusting.

00:30:44.285 --> 00:30:46.115
This is what brothers do.

00:30:48.215 --> 00:30:50.385
By the way, what is going on?

00:30:50.725 --> 00:30:52.285
What is this about Dal becoming the Crown Prince's Concubine?

00:30:54.595 --> 00:30:56.125
I am doing it to protect her.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:30:59.764
I will prove that the Left State Councillor...

00:30:59.765 --> 00:31:02.035
is the master of the Jimjo.

00:31:02.765 --> 00:31:04.835
When I do, you take the Crown Princess Consort... No.

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:08.335
Take your woman's hand and run away.

00:31:16.345 --> 00:31:17.685
Protect your love.

00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:19.105
When I said you were horrible, I lied.

00:33:19.265 --> 00:33:21.205
And when I said I was over you,

00:33:24.445 --> 00:33:25.645
that was a lie.

00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:32.815
- Why all of a sudden? - Left State Councillor will fall.

00:33:33.485 --> 00:33:35.415
And you will be dragged down with him.

00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:41.055
- My father will not fall. - He will.

00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:45.465
When he does, I will take your hand and we will run away together.

00:33:46.535 --> 00:33:48.135
That day will never come.

00:33:48.535 --> 00:33:50.365
It will. It most certainly will.

00:33:51.765 --> 00:33:55.475
We will be happy. We must be. So please,

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:58.375
trust me and just wait a little longer.

00:34:20.335 --> 00:34:22.495
Consummate our marriage?

00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:28.175
Why are they suddenly washing me?

00:34:29.905 --> 00:34:31.245
Do I smell or something?

00:34:35.015 --> 00:34:36.075
Do I?

00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:41.515
You are to spend the night with the Crown Prince.

00:34:44.355 --> 00:34:46.655
What? You mean sleep with him?

00:34:48.895 --> 00:34:49.965
Yes.

00:34:51.565 --> 00:34:53.935
Wait, hold on. I am not physically ready...

00:34:53.995 --> 00:34:56.234
I mean, I am not mentally prepared,

00:34:56.235 --> 00:34:58.335
and I just... Oh, I cannot.

00:34:58.405 --> 00:34:59.405
This is so mortifying.

00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:13.555
How are you feeling?

00:35:15.755 --> 00:35:18.425
- Are you feeling okay? - Yes, well...

00:35:20.255 --> 00:35:21.455
Yes, well...

00:35:22.055 --> 00:35:23.325
Well, yes.

00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:25.425
Good.

00:35:26.935 --> 00:35:27.995
That is a relief.

00:35:35.805 --> 00:35:37.905
Hey, what are you doing with the tie?

00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:45.445
It is time for bed. It is late.

00:36:34.365 --> 00:36:36.235
What are you waiting for? Put out the light.

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:45.605
Yes.

00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:47.275
I will turn it off.

00:37:15.535 --> 00:37:17.245
Gosh, this is not going to work.

00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:22.545
Are you in pain?

00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:26.915
Your back?

00:37:27.615 --> 00:37:29.515
No, I am fine. It is nothing.

00:37:31.225 --> 00:37:32.225
You are clearly not fine.

00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:34.325
Goodness.

00:37:41.565 --> 00:37:42.565
Here is some medicine.

00:37:43.065 --> 00:37:44.635
I will not look, so go on and apply it.

00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:54.045
Gosh.

00:37:56.245 --> 00:37:57.315
Thank you.

00:37:59.685 --> 00:38:01.715
- Do not look. - I am not looking.

00:38:24.445 --> 00:38:25.445
Gosh.

00:38:34.215 --> 00:38:35.555
Goodness.

00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:38.525
My gosh.

00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:45.995
Are you done?

00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:49.035
Hold on. It is on my back.

00:38:50.335 --> 00:38:53.775
You see, applying something to one's own back,

00:38:53.835 --> 00:38:56.905
it is not easy, anatomically. One, two...

00:38:59.205 --> 00:39:00.875
This is so distracting.

00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:03.885
Gosh, that hurts.

00:39:06.785 --> 00:39:08.285
You said you would not look!

00:39:08.915 --> 00:39:10.325
Calm down and hold still.

00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:13.085
Give me the ointment.

00:39:26.335 --> 00:39:29.235
I am just treating your wound, so do not get any funny ideas.

00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:32.675
What? Who said I was?

00:39:50.965 --> 00:39:52.495
The Queen Dowager.

00:39:53.595 --> 00:39:54.935
With a girl in this much pain,

00:39:55.465 --> 00:39:57.065
what does she expect me to do?

00:39:58.435 --> 00:40:00.205
It is not like I am an animal.

00:40:00.975 --> 00:40:03.675
Turns out I am the animal here. It was me.

00:40:05.375 --> 00:40:06.375
What was that?

00:40:06.845 --> 00:40:07.845
Nothing!

00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:36.305
I hate this. I really do.

00:40:45.115 --> 00:40:48.155
Did you hear the snake catcher family was recently wiped out?

00:40:48.485 --> 00:40:52.055
- They say it was the Jimjo Poison. - So I heard.

00:40:52.755 --> 00:40:54.095
It is terrifying. How is anyone supposed to live?

00:40:54.155 --> 00:40:55.555
I am telling you, a new Crown Princess is coming.

00:40:55.895 --> 00:40:57.995
Queen Jangjeong's vengeful spirit is running rampant.

00:40:58.495 --> 00:41:00.125
A woman determined to end the Royal Family's line...

00:41:00.195 --> 00:41:01.965
- We were just getting some soup... - No.

00:41:03.965 --> 00:41:05.964
It is not a curse. It is the Jimjo Poison.

00:41:05.965 --> 00:41:07.275
Good grief, were you not listening?

00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:09.704
Curse or poison, it is a bad omen.

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:12.045
Something so horrid to happen right before the Royal Wedding.

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:15.545
Whose fault do you think it is? The new Crown Princess's, of course.

00:41:16.175 --> 00:41:17.845
For goodness' sake.

00:41:20.455 --> 00:41:24.285
Your Highness. Please do not mind such petty rumours.

00:41:24.485 --> 00:41:28.595
Let them gossip all they want. You will be the Crown Princess soon.

00:41:30.895 --> 00:41:32.925
The Chief Court Lady died recently, did she not?

00:41:33.735 --> 00:41:34.735
Pardon?

00:41:36.135 --> 00:41:37.135
Yes.

00:41:37.535 --> 00:41:40.935
But why bring up the Chief Court Lady all of a sudden?

00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:44.905
No reason.

00:41:47.075 --> 00:41:49.875
I just thought maybe I would not become the Crown Princess...

00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:51.645
after all.

00:41:56.385 --> 00:41:57.385
Are we...

00:41:58.455 --> 00:42:00.695
close enough to be holding hands?

00:42:01.155 --> 00:42:03.025
This is a hand held in farewell.

00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:06.525
Please, call off this Royal Wedding.

00:42:08.135 --> 00:42:11.065
This whole scenario feels awfully familiar.

00:42:11.965 --> 00:42:12.965
If I say no,

00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:14.775
are you going to shoot me again?

00:42:17.205 --> 00:42:18.345
It really hurt, by the way.

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.245
Getting shot.

00:42:24.185 --> 00:42:26.415
If you knew everything, why did you not punish me?

00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:29.685
Because if you got hurt, Je Un would not be able to go on.

00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:32.885
I am glad you are alive.

00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:37.625
What is this? A sudden change of heart?

00:42:38.595 --> 00:42:41.065
Because Prince Je Un needs at least one family member...

00:42:42.565 --> 00:42:43.695
like you, Your Royal Highness.

00:42:45.535 --> 00:42:48.035
I followed my ambitions, so I have no regrets.

00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:50.905
And I intend to keep doing so.

00:42:53.605 --> 00:42:56.515
I will give you the crucial evidence you need to bring down my father.

00:42:57.915 --> 00:42:59.115
Give me your word.

00:42:59.685 --> 00:43:01.315
If I tell you where the Jimjo is,

00:43:01.885 --> 00:43:04.455
you must guarantee that Prince Je Un and I...

00:43:05.655 --> 00:43:07.025
will be able to escape and live in safety.

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:10.295
Where is it?

00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:11.865
The Jimjo.

00:44:12.685 --> 00:44:16.125
This Jimjo is how I seized control of Joseon.

00:44:18.625 --> 00:44:21.065
But you know what?

00:44:22.295 --> 00:44:24.065
The Jimjo's true value...

00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:29.075
is not in its poison, but in its secrecy.

00:44:31.205 --> 00:44:34.275
Once its existence is known, it is no better than any poison.

00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:38.445
But now, rumours of the Jimjo Poison are spreading among the people.

00:44:39.185 --> 00:44:41.315
Did you use the Jimjo Poison on the snake catchers?

00:44:42.185 --> 00:44:43.885
Now that I have been exposed,

00:44:44.155 --> 00:44:47.495
I feared a Police Bureau inquiry would lead to the guild,

00:44:47.555 --> 00:44:48.595
so I made their deaths mysterious...

00:44:51.925 --> 00:44:52.995
The Jimjo Poison...

00:44:54.095 --> 00:44:56.195
should have only been used for the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:44:57.265 --> 00:45:00.505
The Gyesa Year Incident was meant to remain a rumour forever.

00:45:01.375 --> 00:45:05.745
But you have ruined everything.

00:45:06.375 --> 00:45:07.815
Please kill me.

00:45:18.025 --> 00:45:19.655
I will be the one to decide when you die.

00:45:21.195 --> 00:45:24.695
Seal off every secret passage connected to this place.

00:45:25.665 --> 00:45:27.695
And if the Crown Prince manages to find his way here,

00:45:29.535 --> 00:45:30.535
eliminate him.

00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:34.575
The Crown Prince...

00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:36.875
You are ordering me to kill him?

00:45:55.525 --> 00:45:56.955
It is a beautiful day, is it not?

00:45:57.225 --> 00:45:59.795
- Yes. - Heard of the new royal concubine?

00:45:59.995 --> 00:46:01.935
So what if she got the title?

00:46:02.365 --> 00:46:04.605
I heard His Royal Highness has only visited her once.

00:46:05.365 --> 00:46:07.035
Still, I am jealous she gets to be a royal concubine.

00:46:07.105 --> 00:46:09.774
Jealous? She is just a replacement.

00:46:09.775 --> 00:46:11.645
Exactly. To replace the last one.

00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:14.445
The nerve of those girls.

00:46:16.045 --> 00:46:17.045
Just ignore them.

00:46:19.015 --> 00:46:21.155
You see a chicken a lot more often than a pheasant, right?

00:46:40.135 --> 00:46:43.075
My lady, why are you out here? You should be inside.

00:46:57.085 --> 00:46:59.085
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

00:47:00.285 --> 00:47:01.995
It belonged to my father for a long time,

00:47:02.895 --> 00:47:05.325
but one day, he gave ownership to the former Chief Court Lady.

00:47:06.395 --> 00:47:07.465
And shortly after that,

00:47:08.195 --> 00:47:10.035
the Gyesa Year Incident took place.

00:47:12.405 --> 00:47:15.675
(The distillery)

00:47:15.735 --> 00:47:16.835
The distillery.

00:47:25.785 --> 00:47:26.785
This way.

00:48:43.695 --> 00:48:46.265
This is a regular cave, is it not? If it is not here,

00:48:46.325 --> 00:48:48.395
how could a Jimjo possibly live in that tiny house?

00:48:48.795 --> 00:48:51.905
There is something to this distillery. Otherwise,

00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:53.434
the Chief Court Lady's deed and this secret passage...

00:48:53.435 --> 00:48:54.675
would not make any sense.

00:48:55.105 --> 00:48:57.675
And how do you explain the fledgling's frantic cries?

00:49:35.715 --> 00:49:38.045
- A rat! - Will you keep it down?

00:49:52.295 --> 00:49:53.295
Do you hear that?

00:49:54.165 --> 00:49:55.165
The sound of chains.

00:49:56.995 --> 00:49:58.405
There is definitely something in here.

00:49:58.965 --> 00:50:01.635
- The sound is getting louder. - I know.

00:50:15.685 --> 00:50:16.685
Darn it.

00:50:17.255 --> 00:50:18.655
Why did you bring that?

00:50:18.785 --> 00:50:21.695
We are facing the monster Jimjo. Was I supposed to come empty-handed?

00:50:23.255 --> 00:50:24.265
Darn.

00:50:26.295 --> 00:50:27.295
Gosh.

00:50:58.895 --> 00:51:02.635
(Yeon Wol, I will avenge you)

00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:05.805
This one thing...

00:51:07.035 --> 00:51:08.135
is mine.

00:51:53.145 --> 00:51:54.145
What about Dal?

00:51:55.655 --> 00:51:56.655
Where is Dal?

00:51:57.585 --> 00:52:00.025
I thought she said she would wait. Did she leave already?

00:52:01.495 --> 00:52:04.255
- Did she go to the Jimjo chick? - What?

00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:06.295
Why would Dal go there?

00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:08.995
- Right. It was a secret. - Spit it out!

00:52:10.765 --> 00:52:12.035
The thing is...

00:52:12.505 --> 00:52:16.805
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:52:17.105 --> 00:52:19.705
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:20.775
Your Highness!

00:52:30.685 --> 00:52:32.254
- Hey. - Yes?

00:52:32.255 --> 00:52:34.055
What were you thinking?

00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:36.395
How could you let Dal come here all by herself?

00:52:36.995 --> 00:52:39.995
What if the Left State Councillor had actually sent his men after her?

00:52:40.065 --> 00:52:42.535
No, of course I tried to stop her.

00:52:44.935 --> 00:52:45.965
Wait, but...

00:52:46.835 --> 00:52:47.975
If she did not come here,

00:52:49.075 --> 00:52:50.275
then why did she just leave?

00:52:56.975 --> 00:52:58.545
Why did you put ointment on my wounds?

00:52:59.615 --> 00:53:01.055
I hope it would hurt a little less.

00:53:03.185 --> 00:53:04.625
Why did you shield me?

00:53:04.955 --> 00:53:05.955
From now on,

00:53:06.925 --> 00:53:08.025
I will be your shield,

00:53:09.325 --> 00:53:10.495
and you will hide behind me.

00:53:11.525 --> 00:53:13.865
And yet, all you have left for me is a sense of duty.

00:53:14.165 --> 00:53:15.795
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

00:53:16.665 --> 00:53:18.635
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

00:53:19.235 --> 00:53:20.765
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

00:53:35.915 --> 00:53:37.355
Is this feeling a sickness too?

00:53:39.185 --> 00:53:40.655
The more I fall for him,

00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:43.325
the more of a coward I become.

00:53:45.225 --> 00:53:46.225
How pathetic.

00:53:55.175 --> 00:53:57.745
What? You might as well just faint.

00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:02.275
If I passed out, you would just leave me behind.

00:54:02.645 --> 00:54:04.915
I am tempted to leave you behind even if you do not.

00:54:05.885 --> 00:54:09.655
You will guard this place every day so Dal is never left alone here.

00:54:09.755 --> 00:54:12.085
- Got it? - You want me to...

00:54:12.385 --> 00:54:15.425
guard this place? This place that is crawling with rats? Me?

00:54:16.495 --> 00:54:18.325
To the rats, you are the scary one, you idiot.

00:54:18.595 --> 00:54:20.365
That is why they are all scurrying away from you.

00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:24.135
Rats?

00:54:25.735 --> 00:54:27.005
Rats!

00:54:28.605 --> 00:54:29.605
Rats.

00:55:14.655 --> 00:55:15.655
It was not a wall.

00:55:16.315 --> 00:55:17.615
It was a door all along.

00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:37.875
Come out.

00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:45.705
Who is there?

00:56:49.945 --> 00:56:50.945
It is the Choraengi Mask.

00:56:53.885 --> 00:56:55.215
Destroy this place,

00:56:56.215 --> 00:56:59.425
and make the Crown Prince himself release the Jimjo.

00:57:01.655 --> 00:57:02.725
Seize him!

00:57:08.965 --> 00:57:10.035
Your Royal Highness.

00:57:20.075 --> 00:57:21.105
It is explosive!

00:57:22.345 --> 00:57:23.345
Yoon Se Dol!

00:57:29.715 --> 00:57:30.715
Get out!

00:57:57.215 --> 00:57:58.685
It's the Jimjo! Go after it!

00:57:58.985 --> 00:57:59.985
Yes, Your Highness!

00:58:02.515 --> 00:58:04.555
- Go after it! - Yes, Your Highness!

00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:17.095
That is toward the palace.

00:58:17.465 --> 00:58:19.905
Its maternal instinct is strong. It must be going to its chick.

00:58:20.565 --> 00:58:21.675
We have to get to the palace immediately.

00:58:21.905 --> 00:58:24.844
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

00:58:24.845 --> 00:58:26.775
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

00:58:27.645 --> 00:58:28.645
Dal.

00:58:29.545 --> 00:58:30.545
Dal.

00:58:51.505 --> 00:58:52.735
The Jimjo's tracks...

00:58:53.865 --> 00:58:55.975
are all gone.

00:58:58.805 --> 00:59:00.175
There is no other way now.

00:59:01.345 --> 00:59:03.015
We must capture the Jimjo alive.

00:59:23.635 --> 00:59:24.635
What is that?

00:59:26.005 --> 00:59:27.005
What's that?

00:59:52.395 --> 00:59:53.965
Look! Over there! What is that?

00:59:54.225 --> 00:59:55.235
What is that?

00:59:56.235 --> 00:59:59.705
- What is all this commotion? - Your Majesty, look over there...

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.405
My goodness, what in the world is that?

01:00:05.275 --> 01:00:06.305
I am not sure, Your Majesty.

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:13.185
A Jimjo?

01:00:14.785 --> 01:00:16.885
Your Majesty, it is dangerous! Please get to safety.

01:00:19.785 --> 01:00:23.495
- Your Majesty. Hurry! - Yes. Get Her Majesty to safety.

01:00:23.755 --> 01:00:25.765
- Yes! - This way.

01:00:31.535 --> 01:00:32.665
Why is the Jimjo here?

01:00:43.175 --> 01:00:44.175
The chick?

01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:18.745
- Get the flaming arrows ready! - Yes, sir!

01:01:19.515 --> 01:01:20.685
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

01:01:21.485 --> 01:01:24.215
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.625
he will be finished for treason.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.455
I have staked my life on this revenge.

01:01:31.095 --> 01:01:32.125
If it dies here,

01:01:32.425 --> 01:01:34.195
we cannot prove the Left State Councillor is behind this.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:37.295
We have to capture it alive. I cannot let that happen.

01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:39.235
We must capture it alive.

01:01:39.435 --> 01:01:42.705
Lady Park, you should not get involved. Please get to safety.

01:01:42.805 --> 01:01:43.975
I will take full responsibility.

01:01:45.245 --> 01:01:48.545
I will lure the bird. Evacuate the court ladies first.

01:01:48.815 --> 01:01:51.915
Then, have the Royal Guard go to the square and prepare the ropes.

01:01:52.115 --> 01:01:54.515
It must be captured alive.

01:01:54.955 --> 01:01:56.785
- Go. - Yes, my lady.

01:02:02.325 --> 01:02:04.055
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:06.525
Yes, we will move to Injeongjeon Hall.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:08.695
- To the Injeongjeon Hall! - Yes, sir!

01:02:19.145 --> 01:02:21.075
Your Royal Highness, Lady Park...

01:02:25.545 --> 01:02:28.185
Dal, do not do anything.

01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:30.315
Please, do not do anything reckless.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:55.375
I am sorry.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:57.815
It is here!

01:02:58.515 --> 01:02:59.545
Your chick is right here!

01:03:12.295 --> 01:03:13.825
Gosh!

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:46.365
Lady Park, get back!

01:05:05.105 --> 01:05:07.444
Take it! Do not let it escape!

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.575
- Do not let it escape! - Yes, sir!

01:05:13.485 --> 01:05:14.485
Your Royal Highness.

01:05:20.755 --> 01:05:22.095
I am alive.

01:05:23.055 --> 01:05:26.565
What, you think you have nine lives? That death will just spare you?

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.665
What in the world were you thinking?

01:05:32.505 --> 01:05:33.505
But I...

01:05:34.835 --> 01:05:35.835
I was just...

01:05:36.905 --> 01:05:38.645
trying to help you.

01:05:38.705 --> 01:05:41.145
I told you not to help! I told you repeatedly to stay out.

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:43.075
Why do you keep interfering with my revenge?

01:05:45.915 --> 01:05:47.285
You nearly ruined everything!

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:54.385
It is because I know how much this revenge means to you.

01:05:56.395 --> 01:05:58.795
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

01:06:24.455 --> 01:06:25.725
Your Royal Highness.

01:06:56.815 --> 01:06:58.015
Jimjo poison.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.285
It has a clear, odourless, tasteless oil.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.725
From the oil gland in its wattle.

01:07:37.725 --> 01:07:39.065
If it dies...

01:07:53.305 --> 01:07:54.445
It is all over.

01:07:56.815 --> 01:07:57.815
It is all over.

01:08:00.885 --> 01:08:01.885
Everything...

01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:04.455
is over.

01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:08.855
Because of me.

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:14.265
It is all ruined because of me.

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:05.485
Gang Yeon Wol.

01:09:06.985 --> 01:09:08.385
You are like the heavens,

01:09:09.455 --> 01:09:10.455
and your heart...

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:12.755
I will hold it forever, with no regrets.

01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:18.295
You must...

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:20.625
fly free...

01:09:23.565 --> 01:09:24.595
and rest in peace.

01:10:27.825 --> 01:10:28.835
Gosh.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:31.395
Why are you sleeping out here?

01:10:36.505 --> 01:10:37.505
No reason.

01:10:39.445 --> 01:10:40.475
I just could not bring myself...

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:42.615
to sleep soundly.

01:10:44.145 --> 01:10:45.145
I am so sorry.

01:10:46.315 --> 01:10:47.915
I have ruined everything.

01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:52.955
The most important thing to you, Your Highness,

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:56.595
was avenging the Crown Princess.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:10:59.425
And now, because of me, it is all ruined.

01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:03.095
What are you talking about?

01:11:03.935 --> 01:11:05.235
I protected what was most important.

01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:09.205
But the Jimjo is dead, so your revenge is ruined, is it not?

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:10.975
For that revenge...

01:11:14.445 --> 01:11:16.245
I heard you were even willing to risk your life.

01:11:18.885 --> 01:11:20.085
Revenge was the only way...

01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:23.555
I could atone to the Crown Princess.

01:11:24.385 --> 01:11:26.285
Filled with so much hatred and guilt,

01:11:29.355 --> 01:11:30.655
I could not come to you.

01:11:34.495 --> 01:11:35.495
But if you had died,

01:11:36.995 --> 01:11:38.495
I would have had nowhere left to go.

01:11:44.105 --> 01:11:45.105
I just...

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:47.375
I thought...

01:11:48.675 --> 01:11:50.715
you must be furious with me.

01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:54.215
So furious you would never want to see me again.

01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:58.685
I thought that all day, so I just...

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.125
The fault is not yours. It is mine.

01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:06.195
I was angry at myself for always...

01:12:08.195 --> 01:12:09.665
putting you in harm's way.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.945
How could I ever be angry with you?

01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:26.485
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

01:12:28.615 --> 01:12:31.055
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

01:12:34.055 --> 01:12:35.625
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:39.995
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

01:12:44.395 --> 01:12:45.395
That I...

01:12:56.815 --> 01:12:58.275
I am very deeply...

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:02.585
in love...

01:13:04.915 --> 01:13:05.925
with you, Park Dal.

01:13:16.135 --> 01:13:17.135
Me too.

01:15:03.935 --> 01:15:08.805
(Moon River)

01:15:23.995 --> 01:15:26.665
I am not going to let you go, even if you talk my ear off.

01:15:27.025 --> 01:15:28.665
So you hold on to me tight too.

01:15:29.135 --> 01:15:31.195
The Crown Prince and his Concubine are so lovey-dovey.

01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:35.305
The entire palace is buzzing. And if she were to conceive...

01:15:36.775 --> 01:15:38.335
Who do I look like to you now?

01:15:38.405 --> 01:15:40.275
And I... who do you see before you now?

01:15:40.345 --> 01:15:41.675
Because of one woman,

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:44.515
five years of hard work have crumbled to dust.

01:15:44.645 --> 01:15:47.145
A fledgling Jimjo's toxin is weak.

01:15:47.415 --> 01:15:49.515
It cannot become a true Jimjo.

01:15:50.285 --> 01:15:53.785
It seems another sacrifice will be required.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:16.145
