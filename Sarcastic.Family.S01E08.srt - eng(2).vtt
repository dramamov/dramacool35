00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.240
We've been robbed.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.080
You need to adapt to my brother's habits.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.800
His place here…

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
I just cleaned, one day and it's like this.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.960
I came in—

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.680
No, I mean—

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.919
You go into Li Cai's place

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.919
without even saying hi to him.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.759
You just walk straight in.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.919
As the saying goes,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.759
“Birds of a feather flock together.”

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.439
So he and I are family now.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.199
What's wrong with me coming in?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.000
That’s not the literal meaning.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.240
There's another saying:

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240
“The eldest sister is like a mother.”

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.759
I'm practically his mom.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.879
Why would I need to tell him?

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.879
You and your mom are the ones

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.680
who “flock together,” not us.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.240
Anyway…

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.560
you should head to work.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.680
I'll tidy up for him

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.560
and cook something and all that.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.400
This kid…

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.560
Right here.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.360
Missing a big seven.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.199
Every time it's a big seven short.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.199
Always stuck right here.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.840
With one big seven, we'd win.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.759
You think maybe it's because

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.639
you didn’t wash your hands?

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.719
Can you not jinx it?

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.319
I'm just kidding.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.439
You, be more careful.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.759
You can't quit till the very end.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.360
You know that?

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.439
Go on, scratch, scratch again.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.439
What should I scratch?

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.120
See, he just—

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.199
Is there really a gap?

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.879
Meng—

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.560
New lottery shop at the corner.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.120
Come over here.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.120
Two tickets, please.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.400
I don't know how.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.960
What's there to know?

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.560
You just scratch it.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.039
Look at everyone here,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.560
see how happy they are.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.080
I won!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.120
Really?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.120
Won twenty.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.000
Nice.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.879
See?

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.960
Not bad at all.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.800
Come on, keep scratching.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.280
Meng—

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.960
A gentle little scratch,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.840
and your dreams blossom.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.879
Little Meng.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.199
Come on, come on, give it here.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.719
Come on, come on.

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:13.919
This round is definitely

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.479
it’s gonna—

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.759
just be one big seven short.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.040
There's a thief at home.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.160
How many times now?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.360
Still not used to sis's sudden concern?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.360
Come eat, quick.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.439
I never cook at home.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.600
I don't even keep spices.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879
Now your place has everything.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.439
Hasn't it been a long time

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.680
since you ate at home?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.480
Today, taste your sister's cooking.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.000
My sister’s “taste”?

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.279
Isn't it usually “mom's taste”?

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.199
There's also

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.199
“godmother's taste.”

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.519
Right now all I can smell

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.240
is something burnt.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.279
It's my first time cooking too.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.480
You have no idea, cooking is so hard.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.199
Take this braised chicken, for example.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.279
It says dice the radish and potato.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.480
It took me forever to cut them.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.639
Just this one chunk

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.360
took ages to chop.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.160
Hurry up and eat.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.079
Sis.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.439
You worked so hard cooking,

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.680
I’ve decided you can have it all.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.319
Go ahead, you eat it.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.480
How could that be okay?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.519
I’m afraid you won’t have enough.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.759
I already ordered delivery.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.560
I still like Godmom’s cooking best.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.079
I’ll eat rice mixed with her dishes.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.399
Dig in.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.759
Sis.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.519
You didn’t put pineapple in this, right?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.839
Pineapple juice.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:57.959
I’m allergic to pineapple.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.360
My luck is awful today.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480
Totally wasted, this.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.639
Didn’t win on a single one.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.399
As the saying goes,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.839
unlucky in gambling,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.240
means lucky in love.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.000
Manager.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.040
Today you’ll

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.079
definitely have some romance.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.519
There’s a tigress at home.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.079
You’d better pray I hit the jackpot.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.920
No problem.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.720
Manager,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.600
uh…

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:20.439
you said your friend wanted a place.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.639
I picked some listings just for him,

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.720
based on what he wanted.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.319
Have a look.

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.000
No need.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.920
I just referred Lao Cha to my friend.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.800
Bring me along next time he buys.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.279
Take care.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.240
Give it here.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.279
O-one… ten million.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.800
Damn, ten million!

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.120
Ten million…

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:39.279
Get lost.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.639
Meng Hang!

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.839
You shaking like you’ve got Parkinson’s?

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:11.759
Get back to work.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:15.240
Manager,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.360
take me along next time you buy.

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.360
How’s your luck?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.279
Super good.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.240
Let’s scratch together then.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.199
Okay, okay, sure.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.079
It’s a deal.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.439
Sure.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.480
Take care.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.279
Okay, thanks.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:28.839
This customer canceled again.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.639
Sugar‑free made full sugar.

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.399
Matcha powder became cilantro bits.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.919
What are you doing?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.399
Sorry, boss.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.960
I had an allergy, my eyes are swollen.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I can’t see clearly.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:46.879
Where’s my Liuwei Dihuang pills?

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:49.720
Boss, these tapioca pearls,

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.000
aren’t there too few?

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.240
The customer will complain.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.399
Li Cai, those are my Dihuang pills.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.159
Darn it, that’s bad.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.679
Then what about this milk tea?

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.720
These ten wrong drinks,

00:08:58.759 --> 00:08:59.759
come out of your pay.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.240
What? Then I worked for nothing.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.679
Then go find some big idiot

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.279
to buy every single one.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.480
Where am I supposed to find an idiot?

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.200
Ten full‑sugar, cilantro milk teas,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.840
with pearls swapped for Liuwei Dihuang.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.480
There could actually be such an idiot?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.960
That’s amazing.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840
Thank heavens.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.120
Don’t thank heaven.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.440
Thank your big sister.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.240
Dad,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.039
the milk tea is my treat.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.159
You can even butter up the seniors’ uni,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.639
those aunties without diabetes.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.919
What a good kid.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.759
Look at this kid.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.960
Then look at the mom.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.919
What the hell is this?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.440
What’s wrong?

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.679
You’re pregnant.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.720
Li Lili’s

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.039
milk tea she bought

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.039
is really delicious.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:24.879
Get one, get one!

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.840
Here.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.600
Being nice for no reason

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.600
means there’s a catch.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:32.559
Why would I scam you?

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:33.919
Forget it if you won’t drink.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.320
This tastes amazing.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.519
It has a special aftertaste.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.440
That aftertaste.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.279
Meng Hang.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:23.879
Help me scratch this.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:27.879
Sure.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:29.919
They say newbies get lucky.

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:35.759
So satisfying.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.399
Your first try failed too?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.279
Got any more?

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.279
Just forget it.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.960
You’re a wiper, huh.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.960
Just waving back and forth.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.279
Dad.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.240
Have you done scratch‑offs?

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.559
Yeah, I have.

00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:09.759
I’m an old lottery guy.

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.320
I quit over ten years ago.

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:16.200
You…

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.200
You’re hooked.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.000
I didn’t buy any.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.559
I just watch others scratch.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.440
I’m at most secondhand addicted.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.320
Everyone starts out like that.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.879
At first others are scratching.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:31.559
They’re over the moon.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:32.519
You stand there watching.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.840
That’s called “picking joy.”

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.080
Then someone gives you a ticket.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.080
You’re thrilled, scratching away.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.919
That’s called “sharing joy.”

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.039
Then you notice

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:40.519
one day you start craving it.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.480
That’s called “wanting joy.”

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.759
Finally, one day

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:43.519
you make a move.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.240
You buy your first one.

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.240
That’s called “buying joy.”

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:45.799
At that point,

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:46.919
it changes in nature.

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.799
You’re no longer joy’s master,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.279
but addiction’s slave.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.679
A slave.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:52.440
Slave.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.120
A slave.

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:56.799
That sounds terrifying.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:00.840
So how did you quit?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.679
Substitution therapy.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.519
My senior year we had

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.720
cucumber, potato, carrot

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:06.559
all

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.639
peeled by me in the kitchen.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.240
Which stage are you at now?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.399
My hands just itch.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.240
I keep wanting to scratch stuff.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.039
But at home today we don’t

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.360
even have cucumbers or potatoes.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.639
Go have some milk tea.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080
Take your mind off it.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.080
There’s milk tea too?

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:32.919
How do I scratch that?

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.639
Drink it, don’t scratch it.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.399
I’m distracted now.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:07.639
These days,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.080
I don’t dare let Li Cai

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.120
out of my sight at all.

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.360
I keep worrying

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.320
he’s not eating enough,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.360
his life is hard,

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:16.519
he’s not dressed warm,

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:18.039
and no one helps if he’s in trouble.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.720
I never knew you

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:20.879
were this full of love.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.200
Well, I am his sister.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.080
But I don’t have experience.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.440
I don’t know when

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.279
I’ll be a good enough sister.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.200
It’s like scratching lottery tickets.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.600
One day, you just get there.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120
Don’t mention scratch‑offs.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:36.639
Dad told me

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.000
those things are addictive.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.960
With your weak self‑control,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.919
you’d better stay away.

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.120
Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.720
How am I weak‑willed?

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:47.960
Either way, you’re not allowed.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.399
Fine.

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.360
I got it.

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:51.600
But same for you.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.279
From now on you can’t be

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.320
cleaning up after Li Cai daily.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.240
As the saying goes,

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:58.759
Give a man a fish

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.840
is not as good as teach him.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.600
Can you untie your tongue first?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.000
You know what I mean anyway.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.679
You should let him grow up.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.840
Isn’t that how we grew up?

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:12.440
Wait a second.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.120
Come on.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.039
Explain it in detail.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:22.080
I’ll learn from you.

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:27.759
When we were kids,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.840
our first life‑choice ritual

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.120
was called Zhuazhou.

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:40.200
You’re back.

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.000
Sis, I’ve got a question.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.559
How do you even have my key?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.519
You and that huge keychain—

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:48.519
you leave it under the doormat.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:49.360
What were you thinking?

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.720
But I didn’t put it there today.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.840
Yeah, you used the next door mat.

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.919
You wouldn’t walk one extra step.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.879
So it’s my fault now.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.480
Come here, I need to talk to you.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.720
About what?

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:03.440
Talk about what?

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.039
What’s your dream?

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.440
We’re going that big?

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.200
I need to fully understand you

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.119
so I can actually help you.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.839
I haven’t even planned my lunch,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.880
let alone a life dream.

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:15.599
It’s fine.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:16.920
I came prepared.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:19.880
What’s this supposed to mean?

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.960
You want me to cook my own lunch?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:21.839
All you think about is food.

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:23.359
Tie it yourself.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.279
Crawl forward.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.799
Good, keep crawling.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.119
Why does this feel so creepy?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.240
I won’t let this hurt you.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:35.920
And then?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.240
Okay.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:37.880
What is this?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.720
Good, good.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.119
What the heck is this?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.599
Hey, you can’t take that one.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:48.000
That’s for us—

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:49.799
Sis—

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.599
are you making me do Zhuazhou?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
What are you taking that for?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:17:59.920
Whose is it?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.359
I get it now.

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:04.799
You’re meant to be with animals.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.240
I’ll decide this for you.

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:07.400
You’ll study veterinary medicine.

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:08.880
Get licensed, slide right into a job.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.359
Go work for Meng Hang’s dad.

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.599
I can chat with animals,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.680
but I can’t treat them.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.480
Then be an animal therapist.

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:16.960
Med school can’t save aliens.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:17.640
I’m not studying it.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.799
Yes, you are.

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:27.880
Study hard, then take the exam.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.160
This also has

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.920
hundreds of terabytes of videos.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:32.160
Have a look.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.240
So, joke:

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.759
Xu Xian buys Lady White a hat.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.880
Once she puts it on,

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:53.599
she suddenly can’t move.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:54.480
Question:

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.160
what hat is it

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.599
that powerful?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.720
Well?

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.920
A “snake‑pressing” hat.

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:08.000
A snake‑pressing hat.

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:11.559
This is the funniest joke

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:13.039
I’ve heard this year.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.079
Snake‑pressing hat.

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:19.680
Snake‑pressing hat.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.680
Why aren’t you laughing?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.799
Me?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.000
I’m planning to quit.

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:37.480
Won ¥100,000 on scratch‑offs.

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.759
I’m taking a long vacation.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.680
Guys,

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:42.240
good luck.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:47.519
You really can win.

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:50.000
Lao Cha,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.759
after we eat, let’s scratch another.

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:52.839
Let’s go now.

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.279
Go, go, go.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.559
I’m coming too.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:20.240
Aren’t you studying?

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.160
What are you doing here?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.759
Not bad.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:25.440
You weren’t on your phone, right?

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:26.480
No, I wasn’t.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:27.920
Nice.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.359
This kid’s going places.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.079
This kid…

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:41.240
No money.

00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:42.240
Get lost.

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:44.480
Another guy…

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:51.160
Take a guess.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.279
I only boss you around for your own good.

00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:57.759
Can you just stop meddling in my life?

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:58.799
I was doing just fine before.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.079
When I had money, I blew it.

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:01.200
When I was broke, I prayed to Buddha.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.440
You even prayed to Buddha?

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:04.880
Burn a few yuan worth of incense,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.039
and wish for millions in return.

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:08.119
You never make things hard for yourself,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.319
you just make it hard on heaven.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.960
Can you stop making things hard for me?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.720
You think I’m making things hard for you?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.119
I’m your big sister.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.400
How could I possibly hurt you?

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:18.880
Sis, you’re getting more and more human.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.039
It’s scaring me.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.319
What’s so good about this to drink?

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.440
It’s disgustingly sweet.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.680
Mom.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:38.319
What’s got you so worried?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.960
You bought lottery tickets.

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:44.960
You can even tell that?

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:47.680
The scratch‑off flakes from your ticket

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.319
landed all over my hand.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.920
Mom…

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:55.599
Just now,

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:57.119
that was the first one I ever bought,

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:58.559
and it’ll also be the last.

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:01.319
Don’t you dare let Li Lili find out.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.680
I don’t care if she knows or not.

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:04.799
I only care about you.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.359
Thanks, Mom.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.839
How much is the hush money?

00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:17.079
What’s that thing?

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.279
That “last” ticket you mentioned.

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:23.440
I started with a twenty‑yuan one.

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:24.720
Then there were forty‑yuan ones,

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.119
fifty‑yuan ones and hundred‑yuan ones.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.079
Th‑that rush is too strong.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.559
I…

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.599
I don’t even dare touch them.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.000
What’s fun about those little slips?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.599
My coworker just won 100,000 today.

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:34.279
When he came back,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:38.799
he told me,

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:42.200
“Get me ten tickets.”

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.400
Ten fifty‑yuan ones.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.960
This isn’t enough.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.480
If I win 100,000, dock it from that.

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:50.880
Hurry up and go.

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.480
Sis, I was wrong.

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:13.759
This is the last one.

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:16.079
Absolutely the last one.

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:18.640
Once I scratch this, I’ll quit.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.039
Look, look.

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:40.920
I’ll hit you with a five‑kick combo.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.240
Five…

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.640
hit…

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.200
combo…

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:43.519
sweep kick!

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.839
This is my absolute last ticket.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.960
Don’t bother me.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.799
You… you…

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:55.440
Come on, fight!

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.440
I’ll jump in and smack you.

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:57.000
I’m telling you,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.839
Okay, okay, okay.

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:58.960
Come on, bring it.

00:23:59.079 --> 00:23:59.599
This King of Fighters thing—

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.319
I’m telling you, KOF ’97,

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:01.400
it’s older than me, but whatever.

00:24:04.519 --> 00:24:05.920
I still don’t buy it.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.599
This really, really is my last ticket.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:50.880
Sis.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:52.240
Can you please set some boundaries?

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:53.599
I am so done with this.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.039
Been drinking, have you?

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.599
You can’t drink while studying.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.440
I mean, can you stop interfering with me?

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.640
If I don’t step in,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.960
how will you pass the exam?

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:06.160
Sis, can you come out a sec?

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.519
There’s something I want to talk about.

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:11.119
Sis,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.960
just relax, okay?

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:13.759
You don’t need to worry about me.

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:14.839
I’m about to “qualify” very soon.

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:15.880
Qualify for what?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.599
Clinical depression.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.359
Dad.

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.720
Haven’t you quit this for years?

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:29.079
How come you’re scratching again?

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:30.000
Won.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.920
Won, won!

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.799
We won one hundred thousand!

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.519
One hundred thousand!

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.960
What are you talking about?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.920
This is forty‑three, not forty‑eight.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.559
Look.

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:39.000
See?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.680
Dad.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.319
Our eyesight’s this bad now.

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:43.279
Just stop buying these.

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.119
I haven’t scratched in ages.

00:25:45.319 --> 00:25:47.119
My heart and blood pressure shot up.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.160
Don’t be mad, okay?

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:07.599
I’ll never buy them again, alright?

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.359
I’m not mad at you.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.640
I just don’t get Li Cai.

00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:17.160
Then that’s fine.

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.160
He’s got no one to rely on.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.559
I’m his only sister.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.039
I really want him

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:23.519
to feel the warmth of family.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.279
But somehow,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.720
the harder I try,

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:29.359
the more he hates it.

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:32.079
I get it now.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.559
Right now, the two of us

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:35.000
are making the same type of mistake.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.079
What mistake?

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.039
Me,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.839
I’m hooked on windfall fantasies.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:39.759
And you,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.720
you’re addicted to being a sister.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.000
Once people get obsessed,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.119
they easily go overboard.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.279
So what do we do?

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:51.400
Stay calm about it.

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:52.559
Be like me.

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.079
From now on, each month

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.640
I’ll buy just one scratch card.

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:57.000
Just for fun, that’s all.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.119
Didn’t you just say

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:00.079
you’d never buy them again?

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.599
Gotta leave a crack for wealth freedom.

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.000
And during this period,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.839
you do absolutely nothing.

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:08.799
Give Li Cai some space.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.359
Later I’ll help smooth things between you.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:13.400
Can I trust you on that?

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:14.319
You have to.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.559
But on one condition.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:16.680
During this time

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.519
you must respect his boundaries.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.039
I meant you buying only one

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.519
scratch card a month.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:22.400
Deal.

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:27.880
No way.

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:29.079
You really do know me.

00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:31.359
Once a week, is that okay?

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:32.440
What I meant was,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.519
I can’t possibly do nothing at all.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.960
Have you already done something?

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:31.160
What did he say?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.039
You wouldn’t let me listen.

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:33.440
Don’t ask.

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.200
All words you can’t air on TV.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.119
That kid…

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:40.559
Whe– where did he learn that?

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:52.880
From Li Cai.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.759
He was really mad.

00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:56.839
He told you, within one week,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.759
don’t bother him again.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.759
Fine.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.519
One week, then one week it is.

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:05.279
It’s only seven days.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.920
One hundred sixty‑eight hours.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.559
Ten thousand and eighty minutes.

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:22.799
Darn it.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.319
That’s six more months of potatoes.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.400
How come you’ve got no withdrawal?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.480
It suddenly clicked for me.

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.799
Luck really isn’t my strong suit.

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.000
If I had luck, how’d I end up with you?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.119
Didn’t scratch it clean.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.440
When I see half the word “thanks”

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.759
on a ticket, I stop scratching.

00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:03.920
This week,

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.799
with my help, your sister

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:07.599
has done some real

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:08.559
soul-searching.

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:12.559
Um,

00:30:13.599 --> 00:30:14.799
the way I acted before

00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:16.359
really crossed your boundaries.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.559
It was a bit too much.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:19.000
Your sister owes you an apology.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.759
I promise I won’t do that again.

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.440
Let’s just be like friends.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.240
Really?

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.279
Really.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.319
What do you chat about with friends?

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:28.799
We can talk about that too.

00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:30.440
What I chat about with my friends

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440
is all complaining about you.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:36.759
Well…

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.799
Have you been studying lately?

00:30:39.079 --> 00:30:39.519
Yeah.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.799
Good, as long as you have.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.079
Then why’s your book stuck on page three?

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:47.960
It’s even covered in dust.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:49.880
How do you know that?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.960
Did you go to my place?

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.680
No.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:53.839
Be honest.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.160
Your room is really dirty.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.599
I have to clean it every day.

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:00.400
Wait, what?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.319
I always carry my keys now.

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:03.839
Did you secretly copy my key?

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:04.839
No.

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:05.799
Tell the truth.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.359
I knew nothing about this.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.079
I only made two spare keys.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.720
One for me, one for your brother-in-law.

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:17.759
And also,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.640
that girl you chat with every day,

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.680
I read through her Weibo

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.319
and everyone she interacts with.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.599
You’re not even a backup.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.160
You’re like backup number three.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.079
You really need to wise up.

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.119
Seriously, wake up already.

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:30.759
Weren’t you backing off? Why are you—

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.000
Let me tell you a joke.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.720
They say Xu Xian put a hat

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:34.599
on Lady White Snake,

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:35.319
and she couldn’t move.

00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:38.759
Sis…

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.680
I’ve missed you.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.039
Two fledglings, just a month old,

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:50.599
were abandoned in the nest.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.480
A pigeon came bullying them.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.559
Seeing their home invaded,

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.119
the timid, cowardly big sister

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.599
hid her little brother behind her.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.160
She shouted fiercely at the pigeon.

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:01.039
In the end, under her threats,

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:01.920
the pigeon flew off.

00:32:02.119 --> 00:32:03.920
I’m saying, get down from there.

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:06.920
Why does this feel so creepy?

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.640
I would never hurt you.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:09.039
Okay.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.599
Alright.

00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:10.079
What’s this?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640
It’s been a long time

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.000
since you ate at home, right?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.880
Taste your sister’s cooking today.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.960
There’s this really touching show.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.000
Every time I watch it,

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:41.960
it makes me think of us.

00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:42.799
What show?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.880
It’s about siblings Peppa and George,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.839
they’re so much like us.

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:48.240
Really?

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:49.759
Yeah.

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:51.039
How are we alike?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.039
Your skin is just like theirs.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.000
All pink and chubby.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.559
Is it?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.279
Hey, little bro,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.359
I promise you this:

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.519
from now on I’ll try

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.279
not to cross your boundaries.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.680
But you know,

00:33:04.839 --> 00:33:06.680
since I am your own sister,

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.559
can I have just a tiny privilege,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.480
to sometimes cross that line

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.039
and come a bit closer to you?

00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:15.119
Sis, cross my lines all you want.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.200
In front of you

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.200
I can have no upper limit,

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.319
and no bottom line either.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.759
Okay.

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:20.519
That’s wonderful.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.000
This family, honestly…

00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:24.319
watch your sense of boundaries.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.759
I’m having a moment with my sis.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.799
Fine, you two be sentimental.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.440
I’ll just finish that joke.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.680
So, Bai Suzhen

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.559
couldn’t move after putting on a hat.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.279
Why?

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.400
Because the hat she put on

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:35.400
was a “snake–pressing” hat.

00:33:36.319 --> 00:33:37.440
Mind reading.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.720
Once again, you and I

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:40.720
are totally on the same wavelength.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.960
You even said the exact words

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.039
I was about to say next.

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:44.880
The mood’s all built up to this point.

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:46.200
Right now I should shout,

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:47.160
“Everybody,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.000
let’s make dumplings together!”

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:56.319
Sis, I actually hit a snag today.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.839
I mixed a milk tea at work,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.279
my boss says it’ll never sell.

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:00.400
What kind of milk tea?

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:02.000
Stinky tofu, fish mint, and surströmming—

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.799
a special–blend milk tea.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.199
Yeah.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.480
My boss had that exact look.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.119
We can fix this.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:15.400
Bro,

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.480
don’t you worry.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.400
Your brother–in–law

00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:18.599
will definitely back you up.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.039
He can finish every last cup.

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:21.480
It’s so nice having a sister.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.079
Not so nice for your brother–in–law.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:42.840
Addiction—

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.599
a bad habit in Earthlings’ shared unconscious.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.039
It can take on

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.039
all sorts of different forms.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.199
According to my very rough stats,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.559
every single human

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.280
shows at least one sign

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.000
of being addicted.

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.119
Ridiculous.

00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:01.760
We aliens

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:04.760
can’t get addicted to anything.

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:06.760
Where’s my toothbrush?

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:07.920
Which toothbrush?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.119
Take a look—

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.960
isn’t that the one I use on the toilet?

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:12.800
My bad.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.760
I was being a bit absolute.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.679
When it comes to roasting Meng Hang,

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.480
I really can’t quit.

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:21.519
Found it.
