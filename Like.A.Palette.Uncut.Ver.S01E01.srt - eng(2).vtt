00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.790
Doesn't she look familiar?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.990
What's her name again?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.220
She's all over my feed.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910
My university life,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.790
the one I thought
would start out perfectly,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.270
is now turning into a big mess.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.830
Look.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310
- I think I've seen her somewhere.
- I know, right?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.630
Oh...

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.710
Are you okay?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.790
Thank you.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.710
Hey, is she the girl in the video?

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.830
Wait, she is!

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.950
Yeah, you're right.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.670
She looks just like her.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.230
It all started
from this ridiculous video

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.590
that I can't even remember
how it happened.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.270
[The night before]

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.030
And it happened with this senior
I really don't like,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.110
or maybe we can just call her my enemy.

- Let me introduce myself.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.270
My name's Jane,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.490
Jarin Tiansawangwarp.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.550
I'm a freshman
in the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.310
I chose this major

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.030
simply because I love drawing comics.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.990
And why do I love it?

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.630
It all began with reading tons of them.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.790
The more I read,
the more I wanted to draw

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.110
and tell my own stories.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.070
At first, I was just doodling for fun,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.790
but people actually liked it.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.790
As my followers grew,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.270
ToonDenie reached out to me.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.790
And that's how I started earning money
even before graduating high school.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.790
Here's yours.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.030
Next, please.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.590
- What's your name?
- It's Pong.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.750
Pong?

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.430
Here.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.830
Next, please.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.070
What's your name?

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.230
It's Jane.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.710
Jane?

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.230
Why are there so many Janes
in our major this year?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.110
There are a lot.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.670
We're only halfway through,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.070
and there are already
three Janes.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.990
Now it's the fourth Jane?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.070
Right? We've already got
both male and female Janes.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.230
So many Janes.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.110
I can be Janie, then.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.030
We've already got one there.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.990
Alright, then what's your full name?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.710
It's Jarin,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.430
Jarin Tiansawangwarp!

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.430
Okay.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.270
I'll add one syllable
from your first name, then.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.750
That'll be unique.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.070
Sounds great.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.630
Here.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.070
- Thank you.
- No worries.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.350
Next, please.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.110
- I'm Som.
- Som?

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.630
[Jane(Will)]

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.670
JaneWill?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.510
JaneWill go where?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.110
JaneWill?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.150
I can't believe it.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.750
Who would've guessed he'd mash
"Ja" in my first name that means "will"

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.590
into my nickname?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.030
Seriously, who would have a name
that ends with a modal verb?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.990
I mean, sure, the name's a bit odd,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.350
but they don't have to
laugh that hard about it.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.990
Whatever.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.870
For the next four years,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.870
there's no way I'm befriending Cake.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.030
Cake,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.070
here you go.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.310
Aw...

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.470
You bought these for us?

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.910
Thanks, JaneWill.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.830
Which one do you want?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.990
That one.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.150
Nope, take this one.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.950
Well, anything can happen, I guess.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.670
I was so sure
I'd never be friends with her,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.470
but what happened that day
turned it all around.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.990
I'll take this, this, and this, please.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.150
[Jane(Will)]

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.990
That'll be 140 baht, please.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.030
I forgot my wallet.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.630
But I can pay by scanning.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.950
Wait...

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.230
Hey!

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.350
Gosh...

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.310
What's going on?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.950
Why now?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.910
Come on.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.510
Here.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.590
You can pay me back later.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.070
Take it for now.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.670
From that moment on,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.710
all my anger just disappeared.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.470
It felt like we were actually destined
to be friends.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.230
As for Waii,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.470
we met because she forgot
to bring a pen to class.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.670
Next thing I knew,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.430
the three of us
were basically inseparable,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.590
close enough to talk about anything.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.790
We even ended up with a group name:
The Nosy Diggers Club.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.830
There you are!

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.070
You guys done hunting
for the seniors' signatures?

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.870
I've only gotten ten of them, Meen.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.150
What? Why's that?

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.190
I've almost gotten all of them now.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.630
Blame it on her.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.250
What? Why are you blaming me?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.550
If you hadn't been so picky
about the elevator,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.750
we would've had so many more.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.310
Gosh, do you wanna fight?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.170
- Bring it.
- Stop.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.870
Do not fight, girls.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.670
Wait, can you tell me
what actually happened?

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.030
So, Cake has this elevator instinct.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.830
If the left one is on its way,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.630
she'll tell us to wait for the right one

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.750
'cause she feels it'll be quicker.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.510
But she was wrong.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.470
So it was all in your head?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.270
Fine.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.070
Next time, you two can go by yourselves.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.790
- I'm out.
- Aw, don't be mad.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.670
I mean,
you can't put all the blame on her.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.630
- Right.
- Gotta blame those seniors, too.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.550
Exactly!

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.590
They're impossible to track down.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.830
Right? Finding them

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.590
is even harder than finding a boyfriend.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.070
Honestly,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.470
those seniors are just looking for ways
to mess with us freshmen.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.510
You think so?

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.150
That's possible.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.430
Wait, I remember it now.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.230
Especially that jerk...

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.790
Ugh, I couldn't stand him
the moment I saw him.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.830
What was his problem?

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.630
Who are you talking about?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.710
- What was his name again?
- What was it?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.830
- Oh, I know.
- It's on the tip of my tongue.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.870
He's Tang-oh. You know him?

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.190
Oh...

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.310
- The one with funny hair?
- Yeah.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.190
- How funny.
- The male senior...

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.030
- My head...
- Gosh...

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.190
That is too funny.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.790
This angle, okay?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.430
Alright. Take stunning shots, okay?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.430
Snap,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.590
snap,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.590
snap.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.590
Wow, did you really have
to work this hard, Darin?

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.150
Perfect, isn't she?

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.310
Yeah.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.070
Why did you stop, JaneWill?

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.110
Cake!

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.950
What?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.030
I bet that senior doesn't like me.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.070
Who?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.510
That one with the denim jacket.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.110
Wait,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.470
that's Dai,
the campus queen from last year.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.390
She was the campus queen?

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.150
Yeah, that's her!

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.030
Seriously, why would she hate
a goofy newbie like you?

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.190
'Cause you're an eyesore?

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.470
I don't know.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.950
But girls looking at girls,
what else could it mean?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.750
Aren't you just imagining things?

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.950
No, I'm not.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.310
This is already the fourth time.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.070
You sure about that?

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.590
- Did your dad call?
- Stop.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.350
So that means...

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.190
you've also looked at her
four times already.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.470
Otherwise, you wouldn't have known
she looked at you.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.030
I mean, I just felt like
I was being looked at!

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.830
Did you accidentally do something
to upset her?

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.830
Who's upset? What happened?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.790
Should we fight?

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.910
No, it's nothing.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.030
Just go back to sleep.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.670
Dai?

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.550
Wow!

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.390
This is amazing, Darin.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.950
Your sketch is amazing.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.070
Check this out, everyone.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.110
Good linework
not only improves your design skills,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.870
but also makes your work
admired by others,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.550
empowering you
to design with confidence.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.550
Let's give Darin
another round of applause, everyone.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.950
- Darin!
- Yes?

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.550
Are you planning to submit it
to some kind of competition?

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.590
You're giving us a hard time.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.430
Work harder, then.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.390
Ugh!

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.590
Whose sketch is this?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.510
Prarong...

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.230
Yes, Professor.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.110
What kind of sketch is this?

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.950
Gosh,

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.630
even elementary kids
can do better than this.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.270
I won't approve work like this.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.830
Go redo it.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.510
Come on, Professor Erika.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.440
Argh!

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.990
It's Erika Barbara!

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.470
Address me by my full name,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.020
or you'll lose twice the points.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.270
Remember that!

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.670
Come on.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.870
Please, Professor Erika Barbara!

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.350
Erika Barbara!

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.910
Your sketch is too good.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.210
Erika Barbara!

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.590
Do you know Dai's Facebook or Insta?

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.990
Why do you want it?

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.830
My business.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.640
What?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.030
None of your business.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.070
Jeez, you b*tch.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.550
Don't say that to anyone else, alright?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.070
So, do you know her Insta?

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:09.950
What?

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.750
Be pipe-tient.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.470
It's patient!

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.630
[An architecture student]

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.790
Thanks.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.510
Who are you guys talking about?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.310
Ask Cake for that.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.430
I'm busy right now.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.590
[An architecture student]

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.830
Gosh,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.750
you're posing with the faculty sign!

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.070
No need to put it in your bio.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.570
[Pretty, the one who took it]

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600

[It's supposed to be 'architectural']

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.510
She's never really thrown shade
at anyone, though.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.390
And she hasn't replied to any comments.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.590
She only liked them.

for hot pot?]

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.710
Why does she hate me, then?

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.550
Hello?

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.630
Oh...

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.910
Yes, Elf?

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.790
So, Jane,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.390
any sign of your new project yet?

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.150
Well...

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.270
I'm still imagining it.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.230
What?

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.070
You mean you haven't even started?

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.630
I've just been busy with school lately.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.830
No matter how busy you are,

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.030
you should make time
to give me something.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.190
Your fans have been asking me nonstop

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.670
that ToonDenie might literally crash!

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.710
Just give me a little more time, okay?

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:10.150
I swear I'll get it to you in two weeks.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.790
Fine, then.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.150
I'll wait.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.670
But you have to get it to me.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.360
Don't bail on me.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.430
Got it.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.380
Oh...

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.670
This is the old draft!

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.150
Where's the new one?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.830
The creator hasn't sent it yet.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.630
So I wanted to ask you

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.750
if we could publish the old one first?

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.670
Are you crazy?

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.230
People are already complaining
about reruns everywhere.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.470
Now you want to rerun a comic, too?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.310
Go fetch a new draft
and have it ready to post tomorrow!

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.750
Yes.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.030
Can we sit here?

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.910
Come on.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.510
Come here.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.870
Perfect. We got our seats right away.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.790
I've got you something to eat as well.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.870
Isn't that nice of me?

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.910
Say thanks.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.350
Anyway, do you know why they called us?

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:13.910
Who are you asking?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.870
I'm just asking out loud.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.550
If anyone's listening,
go ahead and answer.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.910
Oh, I'm not listening.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.190
What are you guys talking about?

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.670
Seriously,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.510
do you ever actually hear
what anyone says?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.190
I'm eating this.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.190
- Alright, is everyone here?
- Wow, it's good.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.710
So, we called everyone together today

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.500
because we're going to select

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.340
the king and queen
of our Visual Arts major

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.110
to go head-to-head
with the other majors.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.150
Then, we'll select those
who are most suitable

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.600
to represent our faculty

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.430
in the campus king and queen competition.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.670
Excited, aren't you?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.910
So, anyone wanna nominate themselves?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.790
You can nominate your friends as well.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.670
Anyone?

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.390
No.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.310
This one.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.190
If no one's gonna nominate anyone,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.110
then I'll choose for you myself.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.910
That girl.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.790
You, too.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.510
And the last one...

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.190
is you. Get up.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.330
JaneWill!

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.790
Hey, JaneWill!

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.350
- Get this again tomorrow, okay?
- Got it.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.590
She's calling you.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.990
Come here.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.470
Right here.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.670
Come on.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.030
Alright, these two
are rocking a gorgeous style.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.430
Then for the other one,
I want a cute, innocent,

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.910
kinda clumsy vibe.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.910
Make it different, you know.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.670
Why is she standing there?

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.310
You're amazing.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.150
Even I, who rarely laugh,

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.310
couldn't help cracking up.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.390
Right.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.790
Anyway, congratulations.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.590
You're our major's queen now.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.790
You slayed.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.710
Who said I wanted to be it?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.590
What?

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.990
If you didn't want to,

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.910
why did you do what they said?

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.110
I didn't know
they wanted me to be funny.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.530
Please give her a round of applause!

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.790
Good luck.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.430
I'll just sing something simple.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.470
If I sing off-key like usual,
I'll definitely get eliminated.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.910
I'll be safe for sure.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.510
♫I have a pen, I have an apple♫

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.150
♫Uh! Apple-Pen♫

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.870
♫I have a pen, I have pineapple♫

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.350
♫Uh! Pineapple-Pen♫

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.350
Me? A plain Jane?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.710
Going up for the faculty's queen?

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.390
I'd definitely die of embarrassment.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.150
Hey, the crown might land on you.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.470
- Right.
- You never know.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.310
Don't you want a crown?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.990
Nope.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.390
What? Are you serious?

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.830
That's such a big surprise for the year!

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.280
Wow.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.230
How about you tell them yourself?
They're all here,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.390
except Dad.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.670
Hey, why?

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.750
What is it, Junior?

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.590
You're curious, huh?

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.880
Just say it.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.910
Come on,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.230
tell us now.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.850
Come on, sweetie.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.950
Jane got picked
as the major's queen.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.550
What? Seriously?!

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.550
That's unbelievable.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.070
I can't believe

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.230
there's someone uglier than her.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.310
Jimmy!

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.430
Yes?

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.270
That's not a nice thing to say.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.030
Come on,

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.510
I was just kidding, Mom.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.110
Who would even dare
mess with your favorite daughter?

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.270
If she hadn't inherited your beauty,

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.710
she wouldn't have won this title.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.790
When I was young,
I actually won a beauty contest.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.350
Maybe Jane could be
the campus queen, too!

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.710
Let's just eat first, alright?

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.110
No need to dream that far,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.990
or you'll end up disappointed.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.910
Jasmine,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.070
go help your sister
with her walk and her smile.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.950
Better get her ready now.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.670
Alright, you know what?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.990
I'll call your dad

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.190
and tell him
to throw a celebration party for Jane.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.350
- Hey, Mom. Calm down.
- Calm down.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.110
I shouldn't have asked him.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.470
Shouldn't have praised her.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.100
Yay!

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.430
[Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts]

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.710
Alright,

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.750
and this year's Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts is...

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.630
JaneWill, Jarin Tiansawangwarp,

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.590
from Visual Arts!

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.310
Let's all root for JaneWill

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.390
to win the campus queen title
and make our faculty proud!

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.910
But before we all head off,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.230
we have a surprise.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.390
What is it?

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.150
We're going to reveal the seniors
from different majors

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.730
who've been disguised as freshmen.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.760
I wonder who they are.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.490
The first one is...

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.990
Pong, a third-year
Arts and Design major!

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.390
The second one is...

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.470
Joo, a second-year
Fashion Design major!

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.870
The third one is...

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.310
Gluay, a fourth-year
Jewelry Design major!

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.430
And the last one is a Visual Arts major.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.950
You?

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.070
Don't tell me it's you?

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.510
Meen, a sophomore!

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.510
Yay!

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:20.830
It's Meen!

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.670
It's her. Meen's a sophomore!

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.150
Hey, why are you staring at me?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.910
Well,

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.830
I'm just so proud that
my friend is the faculty's queen.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.590
Anyway,

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.430
if you actually win
the campus queen title,

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.510
you might even
get to become an actress.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.230
You know, just like her.
What was her name again?

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.270
Dai!

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.470
Once she became the campus queen,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.910
a film studio reached out
to cast her in a series.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:04.710
Well,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.510
it seems the rain won't stop soon.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.230
Yeah, you're right.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.310
Good thing
my dad happened to be around,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.910
so I asked him to give me a ride.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.910
Mhm.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.910
Dai's actually very pretty, isn't she?

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.310
Her face card is unmatched.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.910
If she goes into showbiz, wow,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.070
she might just become a superstar.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.310
Can you stop talking about her already?

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.750
I don't really like her, you know.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.070
Come on, JaneWill.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.070
Why are you so annoyed with her?

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.070
I don't know.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.590
It's just my irritation, I guess.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.710
Your irritation?

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.390
Are you crazy?

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.830
I said I don't like her. That's it.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.350
If you bring her up again,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.870
I'm done talking to you.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.550
Hey!

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.070
That has nothing to do with this.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.070
If anyone else had said that to me,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.750
I'd have thrown a shoe at them.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.710
Do you want that?

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.630
Didn't hear that.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.510
Didn't hear, my foot!

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.790
Come on, look at you.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.030
Anyway, my dad's here.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.150
Gotta go now.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.390
Bye.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.390
Let's fight again later, okay?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.520
Very well.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.070
What's wrong with her?

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.510
Hey,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.030
what about you?

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.310
You've already had two cups of coffee.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.870
Why are you still so sleepy?

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.070
Are you sure
you're a human and not a koala?

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.910
I've been sleepy since the afternoon,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.030
but I'm still here
'cause I'm worried about you.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.670
Wow.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.710
Really appreciate that, girl.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.990
You should leave, then.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.790
The rain's letting up.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.670
I'll be leaving in a bit, too.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.550
Okay. I'm leaving, then.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.420
Okay.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.670
Oh...

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.710
I'm sorry.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.110
It's okay.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.910
I'm the one who should say sorry

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.790
for sitting too close

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.150
and blocking your way.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.750
[Jane(Will), Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts]

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.070
You're the Queen of FA?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.270
She must've heard
everything I said, right?

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.150
That's why she asked me that,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.070
to show off

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.790
that she won
the campus queen title last year.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.150
Looks like
you'll be seeing a lot of me, then,

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.270
since last year's campus queen
is assigned to guide this year's queens

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.830
until the contest.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.810
There it is.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.750
She's stressing me out.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.790
Nice to meet you.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.790
[Jane(Will)]

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.750
JaneWill...

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.510
She's wearing rose-scented perfume.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.190
You're doomed.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.230
You should be careful
when you're about to gossip.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.070
What's so funny?

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.150
You were right there with me.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.110
Why didn't you give me any sign?

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.070
What? I didn't see her.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.270
If I had, I would've told you.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.830
So, what were you guys saying about her?

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.910
We weren't.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.950
Didn't say a thing.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.350
JaneWill was!

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.630
Was it bad?

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.150
I went all out.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.190
Whoa,

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.230
so you're actually doomed
like Waii said.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.630
She even told me that

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.500
last year's campus king and queen

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.350
are assigned to mentor
this year's kings and queens

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.910
until the contest.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.510
Does that mean
you must see her every day?

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.730
Exactly.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.220
Sorry.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.630
Okay.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.590
You'd better be ready to die,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.030
'cause I'm sure you won't rest in peace.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.070
Cake!

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.950
Come on, enough messing around.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.990
- What?
- She's stressed now.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.030
Let's figure out
how we can help JaneWill.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.750
You mean I need to be serious?

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.430
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.230
Okay, then.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.510
I'll be serious now.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.670
Three, two, one...

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.630
Alright.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.870
Go apologize to Dai with a garland.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.710
What?!

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.430
Do I have to go that far?

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.110
Yeah.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.050
If you've got the guts to gossip,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.350
you must have the guts
to apologize, too.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.270
But isn't that too much?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.110
Do I really need to do that?

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.990
She's not a shrine, either.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.630
Do I have to be that respectful?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.830
Well, you can try other ways
if you want.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.790
But I think this is the best one.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.350
I agree with that.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.430
It wouldn't hurt to try, would it?

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.710
Are you sure?

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.150
Will it really work?

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.910
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.070
It definitely will. Trust me.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.870
Go apologize to Dai with a garland.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.870
Dai, I'm sorry.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.670
I don't want that.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.130
Junior!

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.790
Junior, I want your advice on something.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.340
What is it?

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.830
There's this senior from another faculty
who doesn't like me,

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.510
and I gossiped about her,

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.950
but she heard everything.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.150
Quit ASAP.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.590
Come on!

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.190
Just kidding.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.470
Did you say something bad?

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.950
I did.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.710
I said I didn't like her
and was annoyed with her.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.110
You can just leave her alone.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.590
She's in a different faculty, isn't she?

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.990
I wish I could do that,
but it wouldn't be easy.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.070
Why, though?

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.270
I'm the Queen of FA.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.430
Does it have something to do with this?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.310
Of course it does.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.070
I'm the Queen of FA,

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.110
and she was the campus queen last year.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.050
She's going to be my mentor

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.310
both at the camp and during activities.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.790
My friends said I should apologize
to her with a garland,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.350
but that seems too much.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.880
So I'm thinking of sending her
an apology on Insta,

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.550
but I have no idea how to start

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.390
to make it come off as friendly.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.790
Got it. I'll take care of it.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.510
I've got plenty of experience
apologizing to girls.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.070
First of all,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.710
send her a sad meme
that makes you look pitiful.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.710
A sad meme?

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.030
Then wait
until she accepts your message request.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.910
One hundred percent, she'll reply.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.110
Did you finish the work from last night?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.430
I stayed up all night doing it.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.910
Haven't even slept yet.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.870
Let me get you a cup of coffee, then.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.110
Alright.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.110
What, Dai?

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.270
Come on. It's hot out here.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.160
- What was that?
- It is hot.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.590
What?

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.790
Hello, my friends.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.950
Tell me which one is our model.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.950
Take a guess.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.990
I'll go with that one.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.990
The height is just perfect.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.350
Gosh.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.710
Since we've got Dai, this one's ours.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.150
- This one?!
- Yeah.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.630
- Seriously?!
- Yeah.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.470
Whoa, it looks fantastic.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.710
Tell the professor
I did the pillars, okay?

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.870
- Come on.
- Is that alright?

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.910
That was the trickiest part.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.750
Come on!

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.830
I'll tell her you cut the toothpicks.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.750
Fine.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.830
What are you looking at?

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.550
Nothing.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.830
You're acting suspicious, Darin.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.350
What? I'm not.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.990
Wow, this just looks perfect.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.030
Fantastic.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.510
- Hi.
- Oh, Professor...

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.760
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.030
So, whose model is which?

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.310
- Let me see.
- Take a look right here.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.350
This is my group's model, Professor.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.030
I made it from scratch,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.790
starting with the foundation,

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.000
- the pillars...
- This one

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.950
or this one?

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:48.550
This one, Professor. Not that one.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.430
Bring your models into the classroom,

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:52.510
and give a presentation
one group at a time.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:53.870
Let's go inside.

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:56.290
I hadn't had any sleep or food,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.230
and my whole body
wasn't functioning properly.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.190
Are you sure that's yours?

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.670
I'm certain, Professor.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.750
Alright, come here, everyone.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.310
Come check in right here.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.030
Come on.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.550
Kings to the left,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.870
and queens to the right.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.270
Then, go ahead
and take your profile pictures.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.110
Oh, gosh.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.510
Make sure
your handwriting looks neat, alright?

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.150
- Yuphin!
- Yes?

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.910
Isn't this supposed to be
your responsibility?

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.670
Why's a top-tier scout
like Guichai doing it herself?

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.950
Meet your responsibilities now.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.710
She was speaking,

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.230
so I didn't know when to interrupt.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.830
Do not argue with me.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.510
Just meet your responsibilities.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.510
- Okay.
- I will help her with that.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.110
That's great.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.630
Split the responsibilities, okay?

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.550
We will.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:57.910
My apologies.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.110
Prarong.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.070
Prarong!

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.490
Yes?

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.630
Why are you smiling, shaking,
and not taking any photos?

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.030
Just take the photo.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.470
Yes, Professor.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.820
- Jeez!
- Right here, please.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.110
You guys...

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.750
Do it.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.150
Have you checked in yet?

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.070
Right here, right?

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:16.830
Yes.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.030
Wow, who's that?

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.670
Let me take a closer look at you.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.790
Wow!

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.590
You look gorgeous.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.910
We're actually
already familiar with him, Guichai.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.870
He's Ice, an engineering student.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.830
Could you include him
as one of your male leads as well?

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:36.990
Sure thing.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.670
We're like friends after all,

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.630
so we've got to support each other
all the way.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:41.950
You only need a bit more makeup.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.070
Jane, this way.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.030
Come here.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.650
Uh, well,

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.550
can I quit now?

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.870
There are too many people,

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.270
and it feels kinda hectic.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.950
You can't, Jane.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.210
Or our FA's name will be ruined.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.430
Follow me this way.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.240
Come on.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.390
Oh...

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.630
Hey,

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.470
is your head okay? Lemme see.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.430
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.910
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.950
You ain't even lookin' where ya goin'.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.070
Well, I...

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.990
I'm okay.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.630
And I'm not going anywhere.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:25.950
Sorry.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.510
Have you checked in yet?

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.910
I'll take your profile picture.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.910
Ain't done it yet. I'm on it now.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.430
Hold up here for a sec.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.280
What kind of dialect was that?

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.870
Greetings to both of you.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.470
Why the bow?

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.750
Don't bother. We're in the same year.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.270
Oh, my bad.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.070
That was shocking, wasn't it?

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.150
I'm Pearmai, a law student.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.750
I'm Dear, an architecture student.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.070
I'm Jane from FA.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.550
Girls, once you've had
enough snacks and drinks,

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.430
come with me.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.430
Professor Erika Barbara is waiting.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.670
You can go first.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.990
My stomach aches.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.310
What now?

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.510
Is she okay?

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.670
She said her stomach ached.
I think she meant she needed to pee.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.150
Just now she hit heads
with someone else, too.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.510
For real, what's her deal?

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:55.990
She hasn't replied yet.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.270
[The comic world where fun never ends]

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.430
Could it be that
she finds my profile pic irritating?

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.570
Is this JaneWill?

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.470
Well,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.830
my username already makes it obvious.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.950
Guess I look too good, huh?

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.150
And she can't even call me
by my actual name.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.310
If you're not close to me
but try to call me JaneWill,

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.150
I'll be really pissed.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:07.650
Then wait
until she accepts your message request.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.880
One hundred percent, she'll reply.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.430
Yes.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.130
This is JaneWill.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.670
Hello, Dai.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:24.870
Alright.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.670
What's the matter?

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.590
I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.100
Can you please forgive me, gorgeous?

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:42.830
I'm blushing now.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.670
Wait,

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.970
what is she trying to say?

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.590
All I wanted from her was,
"I forgive you,"

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.830
but now she's blushing?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.070
I know you love green tea.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.390
If you forgive me,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.590
I'll get you ten cups.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.110
That's so generous of you.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.710
My favorite green tea is pricey, though.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.550
I'm not getting the tea.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.710
I'm buying ten cups
for you to put green tea in.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:33.480
Don't worry about it.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.670
I'm not mad at you.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:40.460
Really?

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.430
Yes.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.550
There's no way she's not mad.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.190
Could it be that
this is some kind of trap,

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.230
trying to lure me in?

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.590
So,

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.270
is Dai really not mad at you?

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.270
I wonder about that too.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.510
There's no way she's not mad

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.510
after hearing everything I said.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.870
Well, she could just
be very nice and kind.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.910
After all, she was the campus queen.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.830
No matter how nice she is,

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.670
I still don't trust her.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.830
Don't overthink it.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:34.230
Let it go.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.870
Let it go.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.710
Yeah, that's right.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:43.110
Anyway, it's time.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.830
I gotta go now.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.110
Mhm.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.390
See you tomorrow.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.490
Bye.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.150
I'm very proud of you, Jane.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.070
Why, though?

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.150
You're the prettiest peer mentee
I could ever ask for.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.870
Plus, you're the Queen of FA.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:13.070
Thanks.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.070
But...I feel like I'm not pretty at all

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.950
around everyone else.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.550
Come on, don't say that.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.870
Keep your confidence up, okay?

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:25.910
When I told your other peer mentors,

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.550
they were so proud of you.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.110
They even said
they want to take you out to celebrate.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:31.430
Perfect!

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.470
I've been craving hot pot anyway.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.750
No! We're not eating that.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.070
What? What will we do, then?

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.870
We're university students now,

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.630
so we celebrate at pubs.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.030
- Pubs?
- Yep.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.070
I even booked a table myself.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.470
Well...

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.710
I don't drink alcohol, Meen.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.830
You can just drink sodas
or eat some food.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.310
Come on, I've already told everyone.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.390
Don't tell me it's tonight.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.430
No way.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:02.870
I've got plans tonight.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.510
It's tomorrow night.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.510
Whoa,

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.470
that's so sudden.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.790
I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.030
By the way, what time?

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.270
At 10:30 P.M.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:16.830
At 10:30?

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.910
Is that when we'll meet
or when we'll leave?

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.030
When we'll meet, obviously.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.430
Who goes out drinking
and leaves that early?

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.510
You're funny, really.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.790
I actually have no idea.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.310
I always thought
they started drinking around 6 P.M.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.830
and went home by 7.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.750
I never knew they stayed out this late.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.670
Alright, good girl.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:43.950
So you're coming, right?

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:48.830
I can give it a try.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:50.270
Yay!

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.070
Let me treat you to a milkshake, then.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.030
Sounds good?

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.790
It's on me.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.070
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:57.910
- Alright.
- Let's go.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.350
- A milkshake...
- Sounds good, right?

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:01.790
- I want some whipped cream, too.
- It's on me.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.470
Sure. You can get anything.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.710
What are you doing, guys?

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.190
About to hit the gym.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.230
You wanna be that strong?

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.490
Gotta look good, you know.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.590
What about the others? JaneWill, Waii,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.630
are you free tonight?

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.950
What is it?

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.070
Wanna go watch a movie?

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.270
My treat.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.190
I can't. Already got plans.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:49.710
What?

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.000
Don't tell me it's a date.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.070
Nope, it's just my peer mentors.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.230
They're taking me out to celebrate.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.110
Lucky you.
My mentors haven't done anything so far.

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.070
Gotta go now. I'm in a hurry.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.990
Alright, I've gotta go too.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.790
I need to find an outfit.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.590
Fine.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.070
You're all dumping me.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.110
Waii...

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.430
Waii!

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.190
Probably asleep as always.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.710
Hello, Meen.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.990
What is it, Jane?

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:43.950
Well,

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.310
I have no idea what to put on.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.870
I've never been to a pub,

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.850
so I don't know what others wear.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.350
Is there a dress code?

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.670
Don't worry about it.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.110
Just wear something casual.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.830
Uh...

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.800
Something casual?

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.590
Got it.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.630
Something casual...

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.030
Casual...

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.110
This is it!

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.110
You're amazing, Jane.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.150
Isn't that the Queen of FA?

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:50.100
Looks like she's really drunk.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.470
I think you're right.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.620
I'll go check on her.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.270
You have beautiful eyes,

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.430
gorgeous...

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.750
I wish I had eyes as beautiful as yours.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.950
I must have upset you.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:56.870
Whoa!

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.230
You haven't seen the video, have you?

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.710
That video of you and Dai
is going viral now.
