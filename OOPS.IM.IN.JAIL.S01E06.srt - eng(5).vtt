Hello, Chief.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.120
Hello, Chief.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.750
Hello, Chief.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.520
Chief.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Chief.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.300
Hello, Chief.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.180
How's everything?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.870
Good?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.280
Yeah, good.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.870
Good?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.870
Sleeping?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.760
Get up now.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.620
What's going on?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.870
-Why did the Chief suddenly come?
-How would I know?

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.370
Everyone else is working.
What are you doing?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.370
He came in
and immediately lashed out at him.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.120
Hurry up.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700
Ever since Chief Hu got flagged by
the higher-ups because of Assistant Chen,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.630
he's been nitpicking everything.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.630
What?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.530
Doing it with such an attitude?

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.750
Then don't do it.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.950
If you don't do it, you just lose points.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.970
And losing points just means
you can't get out.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.010
Inmate 5514, sit down!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.289
Con-Continue your work. Don't look.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.250
What?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.500
You wanna hit me?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.060
Go on then, hit me.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.020
All inmates, squat down!

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.610
Inmate 5514, calm down!

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.620
What are you saying?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.750
What the hell are you saying?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.620
That's enough!

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.100
What the hell are you saying?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.010
Jiajun, push him aside!

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.370
Calm down!

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.870
Calm down!

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.250
Calm down!

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.539
I didn't push you!

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.370
What the hell are you saying?

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.370
Calm down! Step back!

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.750
Step back!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.210
Keep running your mouth!
Keep talking, huh?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.370
Put that down.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.000
Director!

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.200
Director, go away!

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.750
Go away!

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.750
Come out!

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.620
Come out here!

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.000
Director Xiao, move aside!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.250
Keep running your mouth, huh?

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.450
Keep running your mouth! Come out here!

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.840
Let go of it!

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.650
Calm down!

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.870
Calm down!

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.250
Calm down.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.500
Calm down.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.970
[OOPS! I'M IN JAIL]

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.120
[Episode 6]

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.290
Let me ask you two—

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.350
what the hell were you doing just now?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.300
What if he had actually stabbed me?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.970
My life is precious.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.870
What? Can you afford to compensate me?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.370
Or you? Can you afford it?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.530
Chief, we were trying to help.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.500
Oh? You were helping?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.900
If you were helping,
would I look like this?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.350
Helping, huh?

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.370
And you? Where were you?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.830
Chief,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.500
I was standing guard at the recheck point.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.750
Slacking off then!

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.870
Every one of you is slacking off!

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.290
Chief.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.500
Li Chengbing is in a bad state today.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.560
Something happened with his family.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.120
His grandmother is having health problems.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.620
So, please don't provoke him anymore.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.600
You think I don't know
he's not in a good state?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.240
Even so, he still shouldn't have behaved
like that!

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.870
What if I weren't in a good state?
Should I take leave?

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870
Should everyone just ignore their duties?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870
They can ignore their duties,
but I can't, right?

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.800
I have to, right?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.290
I don't care.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.000
All of you go write
self-reflection reports.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.620
Also,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.810
do more physical training

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.730
and close combat defense drills!

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.930
Chief, you should join us too.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.830
Didn't you see
I was already defending myself?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.390
Without me defending myself,

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.620
could your Director Xiao

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620
have subdued him that easily?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.750
Could he?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.370
Director Xiao!

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.900
Yes, sir.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.470
Later, go check on Inmate 5514 for me

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.470
and... and see if his hand is broken.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.260
Screw you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Who said that?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.420
What?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.900
Got a problem with me?

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.650
Hit me then.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.800
Idiot.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.160
What? No adults at home
to teach you manners?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.570
There was clearly a report this morning

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.370
that Inmate 5514's mental state
was unstable.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.000
All he does is run his mouth.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.300
Exactly. Chief Hu did that on purpose,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.500
taking his frustration out on us.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.710
It has nothing to do with Zhongwen.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.960
He's just embarrassed and angry.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.450
He probably doesn't mean it.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.180
By the way, Boss,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.370
aren't you supposed to
pick up your daughter today?

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.000
Oh, right.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.310
Shui said that Director Xiao
has been sleeping

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.320
in the standby room for several nights
over the past few weeks.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.190
Why is that?

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.420
Why doesn't someone with a family
sleep at home?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.540
Could you go a day
without video calling your daughter?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
I'd go crazy.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.250
Right?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.480
Working so hard for a lousy supervisor

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.550
like Chief Hu.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.580
No wonder he got divorced.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.970
That's true.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.320
And he has such a tough personality
and only focuses on work.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.090
Living like that must be exhausting.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.450
Inmate 9568 has a stomachache
and needs to go to the Health Division.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.330
Zhiyao, take him there.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.330
Inmate 9568, it's you again.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.160
What on earth did your wife

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.370
put in the food

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.490
that made you have such bad diarrhea?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.370
Was it spicy?

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.320
Not as spicy as you.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.400
You like spicy food, huh?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.370
Seriously, hurry up.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.870
The medicine here doesn't work at all.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.500
I was in agony last night.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.140
Please help me get
an external hospital referral.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.830
I'm not falling for that again.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.080
Falling for what?

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.930
I think he really needs a proper checkup.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.640
See?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.210
Besides, my wife has
a prenatal checkup today.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.520
Prenatal checkup?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.500
You mean your wife is pregnant?

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.050
Oh, you got cheated on.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
What the hell are you talking about?

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.030
You want an ass-kicking?

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.950
Last time at the hospital, one shot
and you got her pregnant?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.750
Two shots.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.570
So gross.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.750
How are two shots gross?

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.550
You hadn't even showered,
and you still did it twice.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.120
What acupressure point did you just press?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.320
It's very effective.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.130
It works.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.950
Tokyo?

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.820
Isn't that too sudden?

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.620
It's really a rare opportunity.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.500
And it's less than 5 days.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.370
I'll be back on the afternoon
of the fifth day.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.750
It's not about how long it takes.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.500
There's a ton of work
waiting for me at the facility.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.250
I need to go with the social workers

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.210
to visit inmates' families

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.900
to help them rebuild family bonds.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.750
Do you know how important
this is for them?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.750
What "family bonds"?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.250
What about your bond with Yuqi?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.430
What about your bond with me?

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.520
I'm always the one compromising for you.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520
Last time, I got into a car accident
because I was

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.580
trying to work around your schedule!

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.560
-Why bring that up now?
-Yuqi.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.870
Mom.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.120
Dad's picking you up today.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.350
Later, I'll be away on a business trip,

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.490
so you'll be with Dad.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.220
You need to listen to him, okay?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.870
Daddy's here! Give me a hug!

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.870
No.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.750
Why not?

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:21.850
You smell!

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.670
You're the smelly one.
Your whole family stinks!

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:25.940
That includes you too.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.500
And that includes you too. How's that?

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.320
I brought egg cakes. Want some?

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.500
Yes.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.620
Then give me a hug.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.220
If I hug you, I get all of them.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.750
Okay, let Dad hug you first.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.250
-Then Mom is off.
-Go away.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.620
Be good for Dad.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.500
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.760
-Alright. Say goodbye to Mom.
-Bye-bye.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.630
Where are you going?

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.710
-The egg cakes are mine now.
-You can't have them!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.240
Why are you running so fast?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.660
I'll be taking a few days off.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.500
Please keep an eye on Li Chengbing.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.360
He hasn't been doing well lately.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.000
Prioritize stabilizing
his condition first.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Okay, got it.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.370
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.160
Thank you.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.450
Miss Fang.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.000
Director.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560
Hello, Director.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.370
What are these?

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.720
We're converting the education room
into a family activity space

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.120
so they can spend time
with their children.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.370
Let me help you. Give me.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.190
-I can handle it myself.
-Gao Zhiyao!

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.120
You don't have anything better to do?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.850
Let me know if you need any help.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.130
I'm heading to the education room now.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.620
Bye-bye.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.660
-Hello, Miss Fang.
-Shui.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.500
Horny much?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.620
Hello, Shui.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.120
Attention, Custody Division staff!

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.930
Yes, sir.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.250
The warden just approved the document

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.500
about this year's
permanent position openings.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.430
Who wants to see?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:30.920
Me.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.370
Full-time position openings!

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.870
Let me see first.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.660
Alright, here you go.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.810
I'm not interested in that.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.330
Let me sit out for a moment.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.410
So what's so great about
a permanent position anyway?

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.370
You don't know?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.600
Let me tell you.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.500
There's a big difference
in retirement pay.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.360
And the key point is job security.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.620
If you're just on contract,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.200
one mistake and you're done—

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.120
fired.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.370
But if you have a permanent position,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.750
unless you break the law,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.750
even if your review is terrible,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.250
your job is still secure.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.500
That's what a rock-solid job is.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.250
Do you see how good that is now?

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.510
If your beef stew is bad, just improve it.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.250
Not beef stew—review.
The performance review.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.120
I know.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
Sounds pretty good.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.870
Right?

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.070
Work a little harder.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.770
You all have a chance.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.650
We're all watching.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.670
But of course,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.620
I'm not the crucial one.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.250
It's the Boss.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.620
Him?

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.370
Don't overthink it.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.500
What's meant to be yours will be yours.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.870
Director, could you tell us the criteria

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.120
so we can prepare better?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.120
The Boss is your criterion.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.680
Hello, it's me.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.680
What? How did that happen?

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.800
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.670
What's wrong?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.040
Yuqi got into a fight.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.830
Her eye is injured.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.710
I'm going over.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.540
Oh, I see. Go ahead.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.090
Sorry, please watch over
things here. Sorry.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.200
Boss! Drive safe!

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.010
Okay.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.750
Watch things here for me
while I'm on leave!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.620
Shui.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.750
While the Director is away these few days,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.000
does that mean we can arrange

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.120
the duty roster however we want?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.620
Dream on.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.260
Of course, I'll be the acting Director.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.660
Let me tell you,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.680
I'll be stricter than the Director.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.590
All of you, stay sharp.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.120
Don't screw up.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.250
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.730
Everyone, back to your posts.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.860
Do your job.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.640
Don't give me trouble.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.000
Then I'll go back to the dorm to sleep.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.870
Don't give me trouble!

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.000
It's like this—"Don't give me trouble."

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You're just like him.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.470
You need to sound more world-weary.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.470
"Don't give me trouble." Like that?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.480
Why did you hit your classmate?

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.230
Are you even listening when I talk to you?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.870
Look at me and stand properly
when I'm talking to you!

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.500
I'll ask you again:

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.250
Why did you fight with your classmate?

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.310
Don't treat me like a prisoner, okay?

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.870
Go away.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.000
Why are you acting like this?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.860
Because I want to go buy egg cakes.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.620
Zhongwen.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.370
The lantern-crafting instructor
is already here.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.250
Go get her.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.750
Jiajun, Jiajun,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.370
the lantern-crafting instructor
has been waiting for a long time.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.000
Why aren't you there yet?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.250
Zhiyao, Zhiyao,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.620
why aren't you at the education room yet?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.510
Zhongwen, did you bring
the instructor over or not?

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.370
What is this? Is he drunk?

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.920
Shui must have forgotten what he said.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.050
Check with him.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.620
Shui, Shui,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.000
am I supposed to go assist with security

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.500
or pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.500
You're Zhongwen?

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.120
Shui, I'm Zhongwen.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.770
Just do as I said earlier.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.210
Yes, that's why I want to
confirm with you.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.750
Shui, did you just ask me

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.070
to go assist with security

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.870
or to pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor?

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.790
None of you were listening to what I said.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.620
What the hell?

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.480
Or should we follow what he said just now?

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.120
Which "just now" exactly?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.370
The point is, what did he just say?

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.900
Exactly.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.660
Zhongwen, the food truck is here.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.500
Hurry to the vehicle check-up point.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.370
Zhiyao,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.250
escort the inmates to visitation.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.750
Jiajun,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.250
there are families dropping off food.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.000
Go collect it quickly. Hurry up.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.750
God, Shui is yelling random orders again.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.200
I seriously have no idea what he wants.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.500
What's happening right now?

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.250
Didn't he ask me to handle visitations
and you to deliver food?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.250
No, I'm delivering food,
and he's inspecting the food truck.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.450
No, he just asked me to
handle visitations.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.730
I already have those two with me.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.870
What other visitations
do you need to handle?

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.000
Ask him.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.120
Are you all deaf?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.250
Wasn't I clear enough?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.000
Shut up! Your mind isn't clear at all.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.500
No!

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.000
-You suck...
-Don't be angry.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.600
You didn't press the button.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.250
I don't dare to.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.050
You do it then.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.050
Copy that, Shui.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.730
Sir,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.330
my wife has been waiting for a long time.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.100
She only took half a day off today.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.520
My lawyer charges by the hour.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.500
Can we speed this up?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.870
Do you three want to sit down and chat?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.870
Hurry up! Move faster, will you?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.000
I'll handle visitations.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.940
I'll go take care of the food truck.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.600
I'll deliver food.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.500
-Food truck. Food delivery. Visitations.
-Food truck. Food delivery. Visitations.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.120
Okay, let's go.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.620
Okay, you go first.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.950
-You first!
-You first!

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.250
Move.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.620
Who's handling the lawyer visits?

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.750
Why hasn't anyone delivered food
to Cell Block Benevolence II?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.120
Why hasn't anyone fixed
the broken sewage pipe?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.120
Stop fooling around! I'm begging you!

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.250
Hurry up! Move! Move faster!

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.870
Hurry up!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.960
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.280
Gao Zhiyao!

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.810
What?

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.860
Have you scheduled
my outside hospital visit yet?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.760
I-I've applied for
the outside hospital visit for you,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.020
but Director Xiao happens to be on leave.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.320
Get Xiao Wenqiang back here.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.130
How am I supposed to do that?

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.390
Figure something out.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.280
Alright.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.620
Do you have any skin medication?

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.950
I'm itching like crazy.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.910
Scabies alert!

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.870
Attention everyone:

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.510
Scabies outbreak in Cell Block Loyalty I!

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.420
All Custody Division staff,
please pay extra attention

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.420
and proceed with isolation
and cleaning procedures!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.620
Scabies?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.120
Scabies, my foot.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.700
Fleas bit me.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.000
AIDS then?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360
Since yesterday,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.870
I've been getting piles of complaints.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.400
And now a scabies outbreak?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.730
What on earth are you all doing?

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.250
Senior.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.500
Please teach them properly, okay?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.250
Do I need to teach you
how to train newcomers?

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.120
Chief,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.070
I'll reflect on myself.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.670
I'll keep a close eye on them.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.500
Thank you.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.580
Yes, sir.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.800
Everyone who screwed up, write me reports!

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.530
Especially you three, Gao Zhiyao.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.870
Don't think
that just because the Director isn't here,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.870
you can slack off!

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.220
We didn't.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.380
What do you mean you didn't?

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.310
You three cause the most problems!

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.120
You too, and you're a senior.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.230
Senior.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.620
Please train them properly, will you?

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.620
Yes, sir!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.070
Let me tell you all,

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.850
nobody leaves

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.630
until everything is handled.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.460
That's too hot!

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.750
I'm sorry.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120
I'm sorry.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.530
Gao Zhiyao.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.810
What are you doing?

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.370
Picking up money?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.250
Senior.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.250
How did you know?

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.250
I found that.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.620
This is contraband.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.250
It needs to be confiscated.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.310
What? Trying to keep it for yourself?

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.710
Are you guys
doing your job properly lately?

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.840
Step it up, will you?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.290
Director Xiao finally got some time off

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.370
to spend with his daughter.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.120
Don't make him get called back to work

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.750
just because you guys can't do your jobs.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.350
We're short-staffed now...

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.750
and Shui is really not up to the task.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.870
This isn't about being short-staffed;

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.000
it's about using your heads, isn't it?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
How about this?

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.369
After your shift,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.859
let's meet at Mona's bar.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.030
Where are all my shrimpies?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.280
Gao Zhiyao.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.750
Yes.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.500
Come on.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.620
Sit.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.600
I'm busy. I'm disinfecting.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.740
Inmate 9568's goldfish—

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.850
was it the "fish ball soup"
you were talking about the other day?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.770
What goldfish? What fish ball soup?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.860
Did you put a goldfish

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.750
in the fish tank in my office...

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500
and let it eat all my shrimpies?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.120
Senior.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.120
W-What are you talking about?

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.320
I don't understand.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.300
Did Inmate 9568 tell you to do that?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.250
Senior.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.250
You need evidence to accuse someone.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.410
You can't just see fish

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.000
in Inmate 9568's cell

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.660
and claim he told me to do that.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.710
Those were over 20 lives!

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.000
Do you know
how long I've raised them?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.660
Each one even had its own name!

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.200
You want evidence, huh?

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.870
Fine.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.210
Just hope I don't find any.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.620
Wait!

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.680
The bed hasn't been disinfected yet!

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.370
Let me sanitize you.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.450
Let me wipe it for you.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.500
That's enough.
My underwear is all wet now.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.330
Come on.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220
My hands!

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.500
I'm sorry.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.350
[Mona]

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.500
While Director Xiao is away these days,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.100
has anyone encountered any problems?

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.730
I suspect Shui has a goldfish memory.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.230
He often mixes things up.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.370
Right. Once he mistook my voice

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.250
for Zhongwen's.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.710
Do our voices sound alike?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.750
You say it.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.120
Do our voices sound alike?

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.250
Do our voices sound alike?

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.000
Do our voices sound alike?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.120
-Sound alike?
-Sound alike?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.220
-Not really, right?
-Not really, right?

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.120
Just by listening to the voices, they...

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.250
they do sound a bit similar.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.370
No, Senior.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.760
I didn't expect

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.470
I'd miss Director Xiao this much.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.470
He's always grumpy at work—

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.870
but who knew he was so scared of his wife?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.400
He's not afraid of his wife.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.720
It's because he used to be
so busy with work

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.100
that he never had time to help
take care of their kid.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.850
Then his wife got overwhelmed

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.260
and had a car accident.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.720
She almost didn't make it.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.000
He really should've sent
their kid to daycare.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.580
Why push himself this hard?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.160
When Director Xiao was young,

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.750
he spent time in juvenile detention.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.810
That had a significant impact on him.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.460
So what he most wants to do now

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.860
is help inmates reintegrate into society.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.370
Stay back!

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:33.660
Stay away from me!

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.750
[Three years ago]

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.080
Three years ago, when I first joined
the Custody Division,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.200
there was an inmate riot.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.870
Get me a car!

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.160
Wu Mingcai, calm down.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.250
I'm here to help you.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.620
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.870
Let go of my junior.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.270
I know you need a hostage.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.120
Let me switch with him.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.980
Xiao Wenqiang.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.870
Xiao Wenqiang.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:51.930
Take off your gear!

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.790
Hurry up!

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.750
Handcuff yourself!

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.070
Hurry up! Handcuff yourself!

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:00.870
Now!

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.500
No...

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.250
Tell them to put their weapons down!

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.120
Put them down!

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120
Put them down!

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.170
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Wu Mingcai.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.900
Let me be your hostage.
I'm here to help you.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.680
I'll do whatever you want. Let him go.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.500
Don't try anything!

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.870
Okay, take me.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.970
Come here!

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.630
What? What do you want?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.770
Stop staring! What are you up to?

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.080
Director Xiao has always been like that—
throwing himself into danger

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.280
and neglecting what's more important
to him: his family.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.870
So I hope all of you here

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.530
can cover for him when needed,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.510
so that he can

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.620
spend some quality time with his daughter.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.480
Can you do that?

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.250
Sure.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800
Come on, perk up.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.580
Let's get to today's topic.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.980
"Shui's Chaos." Repeat after me.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.610
-Shui's Chaos.
-Shui's Chaos.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.610
Yes. Shui is

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.370
someone with very rigid thinking.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.620
Simply put, he has a ping-pong brain.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.670
Ping-pong brain?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.060
He's someone with decent focus,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.950
but he's very rigid.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.080
It's like that.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.350
You hit one ball to him,
and he hits it back.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.480
That kind of person.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:25.330
Exactly.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.620
He can only handle one thing at a time.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.250
If there are two things, he gets confused

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.250
and can't manage.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.060
Shui is getting older,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.250
so we shouldn't try to change him.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.750
But all of you here are different.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.010
Because your heads...

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.760
are completely empty.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.780
Is that a compliment or an insult?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.920
It's a statement of fact.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.940
Your heads are empty,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.570
which means there's always room
for new ideas.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.920
A compliment.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.070
Actually, controlling the situation
isn't hard.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.570
Just think zone defense.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.840
Zone defense?

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.250
The three of you plus Shun
make four people.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.120
You four

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.110
each choose an area to cover,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.730
and when someone needs backup,

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.120
you help and support each other.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.870
Understand?

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:10.750
Go ahead.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.200
Like now with the scabies outbreak,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.740
I'm busy as hell
with disinfecting the cells.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.850
If Shui asks me to help elsewhere...

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.620
Zhongwen, Zhongwen,

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.960
please go to the third gate.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.870
We have VIP visitors.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.000
Shui,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.980
I'm nowhere near finished here.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.620
Jiajun.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Help cover for him?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.870
Shui, I'm Zhongwen.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:27.450
Sorry,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.120
I'm not that busy right now.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.880
I'll go help right away.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.370
Nice, Zhongwen.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.850
I'll be counting on you.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.890
Thank you, Shui.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.040
What if Jiajun gets swamped too?

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:38.870
Jiajun, Jiajun!

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.620
Take Inmate 8014 to see the lawyer.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.370
After the meeting, go deliver the food
that other families sent.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.870
Then go pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.250
Go to hell!

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.850
Shui, I haven't finished cleaning
the bathroom.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.310
Zhiyao.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.330
Help cover.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.950
Senior, I'll help Jiajun.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.830
-Oh.
-Okay.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.460
I'm here!

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.540
Hi, you're here.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.700
But remember to return to defense.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.620
Go back to the post you originally chose.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.370
Senior! I'm back.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.750
-You okay?
-Okay.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.870
Reinforce the defense.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.730
That's all it is—just help out...

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.080
What if Zhiyao gets overwhelmed,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.000
-and Shui asks him to...
-Just ignore Shui.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.230
You three need to stick together.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.250
Shui!

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.250
The recheck point is nearby.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.120
I'll go restock now. I'll handle it.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.870
Are you sure about that?

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.000
I've got this. Don't worry.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Hey! I haven't agreed yet!

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.880
Okay.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.530
Zhiyao!

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.250
There's a power outage
in Cell Block Harmony I.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.460
Go check it out.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.340
Jiajun, go deliver the food
that other families sent!

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.860
Zhongwen, the truck has arrived!

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.250
Go get it at the vehicle check-up point.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.120
Shui, it's Zhiyao.
I'll take the vehicle inspection.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.250
I'll deliver the food.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.000
I'll handle the power outage.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.620
Good. Very efficient.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.790
Today, you all

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.870
have improved a lot.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:46.720
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.870
-Reinforce the defense!
-Reinforce the defense!

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.500
Let's go!

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.380
For once,

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.250
we can get everything done

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.120
and just chill while standing guard.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.820
Yeah.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.100
Good thing Yijie helped out.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.120
I hope the permanent position openings

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.380
won't get canceled because of this mess.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.670
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.310
The permanent position openings.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.750
Don't worry.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.020
You'll definitely get an opening.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.570
How much longer do they need to sunbathe?

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.120
They say if they sunbathe like this

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.160
for 49 minutes,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.290
the scabies will get better.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.610
No idea where they heard that.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.140
The solar panels told them?

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.830
Why did you say that so loudly?

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.320
Senior.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.080
What are you doing here?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.430
Well, isn't there
a family day event today?

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.790
I figured we're short-staffed,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.920
so I came to help out.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.930
What about Yuqi?

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.500
Aren't you supposed to take care of her?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.000
This morning, when I left,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.910
she insisted on tagging along.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.240
She just wanted to come.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.730
Then who's looking after her now?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.250
Hi!

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.860
-Hi, Yuqi.
-Hello.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:25.750
I'm Zhiyao.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.620
Zhongwen.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.870
Get back and prep for your shift.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.370
Okay.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.870
It's my turn to babysit you now.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.120
You're the second leg.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120
That's right.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.000
I'm the most handsome second leg,
don't you think?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.750
No. He's more handsome.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.000
There will be a third leg coming later,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.130
and you can see if he's handsome or not.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:45.790
Today,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.270
our facility is having a family day event.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.620
So your dad is quite busy.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.150
Yuqi, wait a little longer.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.790
Today is very important to everyone.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.070
Some inmates

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.000
only get to see

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.120
their families or children
once or twice a year.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.380
Everyone is very busy.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.870
Can I go inside later?

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.120
Your dad is working all day today.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.850
He'll probably be pretty busy.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.500
Yes.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.290
He never lets me come here.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.490
I begged him for so long today
before he finally agreed.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.260
He probably thinks it's inconvenient.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.620
Why? He's not even an inmate,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.570
and I can't see him?

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.500
Alright.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.450
Collect your things.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.650
I'll take you inside.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.250
Really?

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.060
Are you sure?

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.630
It's fine. No problem.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.860
Please, take me in.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.850
Okay, we'll take you.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.040
Let's go.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.410
One, two, three, go!

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.580
Thank you.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.870
Golden Retriever.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:11.620
Golden Retriever?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.150
-It's big.
-I like big dogs.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.720
Is that a Chihuahua on your arm?

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.050
Yuqi, don't talk to strangers.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.940
He's a bad guy.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.870
Am I bad?

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.670
He says you're a bad guy.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.210
What bad things did you do?

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.250
A lot.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.260
Wanna hear?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.120
I did something bad recently too.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.370
I hit my classmate.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.750
How did you hit him?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.830
Like this, swinging my fist,
pulling his hair like this,

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.290
and kicking him like this.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.800
He made fun of me,
saying my dad is in prison.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.800
Damn, what a foul mouth.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.250
You swore.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.790
I'm sorry.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.050
Which one is your dad?

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.640
Bro, stop messing around.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.500
-I can't tell you.
-Let's go in.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.500
Because my dad manages
a lot of people here,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.900
and many people hate him.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.250
You're...

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.840
Xiao Wenqiang's daughter?

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.120
What else did your little brother make?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.750
This one?

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.500
So cute.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.130
Senior.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.970
Director.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.910
Zhiyao, what are you doing here?

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.140
What are you doing here?

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:20.940
Where is Yuqi?

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.250
Yuqi, your dad's here!

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.620
Dad!

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.990
Are you crazy?

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.260
Why did you bring my daughter
to the custody area?

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.210
Who's in charge of the third gate today?

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.010
Shun.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.730
I told him she's your daughter,

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:39.730
so he let us in.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.560
He'll be disciplined for this.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.470
Director, this was my idea.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.160
It has nothing to do with Shun.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.250
Didn't you say we should help him?

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:47.870
"Help?"

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.040
That was supposed to be outside
the third gate.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.160
What were you thinking?

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.000
This is the most direct way

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.660
for Yuqi to understand
what her father does.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.290
Rules are rules.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.370
She shouldn't have come in.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.750
Do you still not understand?

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.830
What the hell are you doing?

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.160
It's fine, Director.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.310
Yuqi is here now. It's okay.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.340
Who told you it's okay?

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.200
Director Xiao!

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.090
Could you please
keep your voice down here?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.200
Yuqi just wants to understand your job.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.280
She wants to spend time with you.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.240
I'm begging you all—

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.730
stop interfering in my life, okay?

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.090
Don't cause me trouble.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:23.620
Let's go.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.020
I don't want to go.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.250
Yuqi.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.070
It's not safe for you here.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.620
How can it not be safe when you're here?

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.220
All the uncles here are really nice.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.870
What uncle?

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.620
There was a handsome uncle
over there just now.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.120
He told me what your job is.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.820
What did he say?

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.370
We're locked up here

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.500
because we made mistakes.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.620
But people outside think we're bad,

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.620
so they've given up on us.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.790
He works very hard.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.370
He spends a lot of time making sure

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.230
that those of us who made mistakes

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.240
are properly taken care of.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.370
Zhang Zixu!

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.400
Chief, I trust Zhongwen.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.950
My dad says

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.370
people in prison did something wrong,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.870
and that's why they're here
to reflect on their actions.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.790
Reflect?

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.370
Yes, that's what my dad says.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.780
We're reflecting properly.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.500
Are you really a bad guy?

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.900
I think you're a good guy.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.490
I think I'm a good guy too.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.750
Good guy.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.820
Let me show you something.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.580
A lollipop.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.870
Here.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.620
My dad says I shouldn't take things
from strangers.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.190
What's your name?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.850
Xiao Yuqi.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.000
I'm Zhang Longji.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.500
Nice to meet you. We're friends now.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.780
If your classmates bully you again,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.870
just say my name.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:11.490
Here.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.430
Thank you.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.870
I just wanted to come in and see

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.050
if your job is

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.000
exactly as I imagined.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.540
So next time when they make fun of me,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.670
I can tell them.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.000
What do they make fun of you for?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.030
They say that you're in prison.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.870
They all say that?

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.040
Because Mom always says

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.310
working in a prison

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.730
is basically serving a sentence yourself.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.550
So that's why you fought with them?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.250
Okay.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.750
Now you understand.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.650
From now on, just explain it
to them properly.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.580
Don't fight with them, alright?

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.320
Dad, can I come visit you often?

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.740
I want to make you happier.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.670
Dad, damn.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.050
Hold on, hold on.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:11.950
What did you just say?

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.870
Zhang Longji told me just now...

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.690
"Damn" isn't a swear word.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.370
It's just a way

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.970
to say "You've worked hard."

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.770
Dad, you've worked hard.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.250
Here, Boss.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.260
Make your selection.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:01.440
Come on.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.370
How am I supposed to choose?

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:11.750
This one then.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.500
Have them gather around.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.270
Zhiyao, Zhongwen, Jiajun,

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.170
gather around!

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.170
Boss has something to announce.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.030
You've all been working here
for a while now.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.730
We've seen your performance.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.750
There's only
one permanent position opening.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.080
We still have to choose.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.719
-Now, we're announcing who won this spot.
-Definitely you.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.389
Shui, please make the announcement.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:34.639
I'll announce it now.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.540
And the winner is...

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.040
Gao Zhiyao!

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.699
Congratulations, congratulations.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:46.449
Seriously?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.449
Director, why me?

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.620
Actually, all three of you
have been doing very well.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.739
But we still had to make a decision.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.679
That's all there is to it.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.340
Don't worry.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.739
More openings will come.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.360
You all have worked hard lately.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.230
Drinks on me!

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.660
-Thank you, Boss!
-Thank you, Boss!

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.520
Maybe if I take a few more days off,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.960
Shui might retire before I get back.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.610
No way, I still have four years left.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.610
I'm only 59.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.610
Have a soda. Here.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.300
Shun, how much longer for you?

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.120
Zhiyao,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.310
congratulations.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.120
Does... Does he mean it?

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120
It seems fake.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.060
That's what you get for being so nosy.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.590
Feels good, right?

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.250
Yes, it does.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.310
Come to work for me tomorrow.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.380
I'm an old man.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.720
My arms get sore too.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.370
What's wrong? You seem troubled.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.980
I'm worried about your expansion project.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.370
Well,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.680
I'll supervise

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.290
and report the progress

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.550
to you at any time.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Jiang Guocheng,

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.800
do I look like I'm joking with you?

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.680
You were the one
who requested this initially.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.900
I've been running around, busy with this

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.150
for over half a year,

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.180
and you still can't get it done
on your end.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.530
Are you playing me?

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.850
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.090
And how soon is that?

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.460
Give me a specific time.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.750
Don't forget,

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.470
I can turn this matter against you.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.750
I'm starting to wonder

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.140
why you've been so nice to me
all this time.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.000
What do you mean by that?

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.350
Nothing, really.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.120
Alright.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.370
My shoulders.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.210
Taking a break?

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:28.500
Come on up.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.500
Senior.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.820
Are you that low on vitamin D?

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.500
I heard that Director Xiao promoted you
to permanent staff.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.630
So, how does it feel?

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.960
Any thoughts about it?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.500
How do I feel?

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:51.820
Well...

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.500
it feels quite strange.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.370
I never thought I'd end up
in a place like this,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.700
taking care of inmates.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.920
But after working here for a while,

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.770
I've gotten... some fresh perspectives
and a clearer direction.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.710
I now want to be like Director Xiao,

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.620
helping prisoners become better people.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.560
Everyone...

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.030
deserves a second chance, right?

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.210
You've been working hard.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.220
I can see you're pretty tired lately.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.970
I know a really good massage place.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.500
Let's go together after work.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.250
My treat.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:26.970
Sure.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.870
If you're paying, I'm in.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.480
I think that place is called

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.250
Phoenix Beauty Salon.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.380
Have you heard of it?

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:46.620
Drop the act.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.630
I already know you're
one of Zhang Wenfeng's guys.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.430
Senior, what...

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.830
what are you talking about?

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.030
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.620
Still playing dumb.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.740
This contains footage of you
sneaking to see Inmate 9568

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.140
and smuggling contraband

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.620
when you first came to work here.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.820
And footage of you fixing games

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.200
and throwing goldfish into my tank—

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.130
letting them eat all my shrimpies!

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.820
Yet you still deny it?

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.970
Won't admit it?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.330
Won't say anything? Not saying anything?

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:18.920
Senior.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.450
I have all the evidence.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.280
Anything you want to say?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.170
Come on, I want to hear
your side of the story.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.250
What's your relationship
with Zhang Wenfeng?

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.220
And how did you get to work here?

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.220
Who's the mole inside our facility?

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:37.850
Senior.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.500
I-I really don't know.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.840
I'm just a small fry.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.000
Is that so?

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.110
Then I'll hand over the evidence.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.250
Wait, wait!

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.850
I'm really not

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.490
one of Zhang Wenfeng's guys.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.120
I... I was forced into this.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.750
I...

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.080
I'm in debt,

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.770
and that's why they arranged for me
to come here

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.000
to take care of Inmate 9568.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
As for other things,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.260
I-I really don't know.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.000
And they said if I didn't cooperate,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.930
they would shut down my mom's shop.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.230
My mom raised me by selling beef noodles.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.850
And her beef noodles are
incredibly delicious!

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.160
It'd be such a waste if the shop closed.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.220
Breaking the law is breaking the law.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.950
What does that have to do
with a beef noodle stand?

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.000
Yeah, I guess it doesn't.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.920
-But, Senior...
-Alright, alright.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120
Then give me

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.250
a reason not to report you.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.030
Go ahead.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.440
I want to start over.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.940
I ruined my life because I was frustrated

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.110
and turned to gambling.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.500
But now that I'm working at the facility,

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.750
I feel grounded.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.180
This might be my only path forward.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.270
Once I pay off my debts...

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.120
I can start fresh.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:05.500
Senior.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.680
Even though I was planted here,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.350
Senior,

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.170
you can see my work ethic, right?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.080
How I treated Zhang Zixu,

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.740
Zhongwen, and Director Xiao—

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.670
you've seen it all, haven't you?

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.620
Right?

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.280
I can choose not to report you.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.020
But I have one condition.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.070
W-What condition?

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.640
I want you to keep me updated on any news

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.750
about Zhang Wenfeng

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:36.880
or Chihuahua.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.250
Whenever you learn anything,

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.450
tell me immediately.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.750
S-So...

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.250
you want me to be your informant?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.680
That's right.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.630
After all, I'm after

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.690
the biggest bad egg in this facility.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.410
I'll be counting on you now.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
I'm doomed.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.040
Don't double agents usually die miserably?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.590
You want to say

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.730
that being a double agent
might end badly, right?

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.000
Listen,

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.630
if you don't do your job well,

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.030
you'll end up even worse.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.440
Come on.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:25.250
I believe in you.
