00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.320
Fireflies...

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.240
There aren't many left now.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.280
When I was little, there were so many.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.400
Old Jiang.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.480
This is for you.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.680
Pretty nice, right?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.520
Alright, I'll accept it.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.720
Students by the window, close the curtains.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240
Tonight,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760
we're watching a movie.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480
Teacher Jiang, I don't want to watch.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.520
I still have some mock exam papers to do.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
How long has it been since you watched a movie?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.760
It's been a long time.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.640
After we finish tonight,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.120
evening self-study session is over.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.040
Everyone can go home early and rest.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.040
Do the papers tomorrow.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.480
By the way, Director,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.280
after the movie ends,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.560
will you give us a speech?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.440
You think

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.240
I want to keep a stern face?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.440
It's just to look authoritative.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.000
See,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.720
the kids are about to leave.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600
So I can

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.760
stop pretending.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.440
No more acting, cards on the table.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.640
(If you have a dream,)

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.160
(you must defend it.)

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.000
(People who achieve nothing)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.920
(will say you can't succeed.)

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760
(If you have an ideal,)

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.280
(you must strive for it.)

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.200
(That's it.)

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.960
Yu Xingchen,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.040
what do you want to be?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.280
And you?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.200
I think

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.920
I can't be a stockbroker,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.840
or an artist,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.680
or a scientist.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.720
I want to be a teacher.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.120
Teach in impoverished mountainous areas.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.720
Have you thought about

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.400
in a dozen years,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.080
our country will end poverty.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.600
No more impoverished areas.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.280
Really?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.480
Then...

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.640
I'll just be

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600
an ordinary teacher.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.960
I don't expect every student

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.720
to get into Tsinghua or Peking University.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.880
But I hope

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.360
each one can be sincere,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.640
kind,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.360
confident,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.120
and brave.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.040
Just like...

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.280
like you.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.560
So in her heart,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.240
her future is so clear.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.000
For her,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.920
there are such beautiful dreams.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.040
But what else can I do for her?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.560
I can only wish her safety.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.400
Do you think I can be a teacher?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.440
You definitely can.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.120
Let's go.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640
Go, go, go.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.480
Are you leaving?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.600
Let's go together.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.920
Aren't you going with Yu Xingchen?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.800
He's rarely this focused.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.040
I don't want to disturb him.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.720
After watching the movie,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.080
I want to think alone

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.800
about my future path.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.800
Classmates,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.360
I ask for your forgiveness

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.080
for not letting you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.560
enjoy these three youthful years

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.000
carefree.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.960
I couldn't lighten your burden.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.400
Besides assignments,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.480
I gave you little else.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.360
But all of this

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.200
was to help you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.760
do well in the upcoming college entrance exam.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.720
Achieve good results.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.600
Classmates,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.520
I don't ask for anything in return.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.680
But when you succeed,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.760
repay your parents,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.160
your family,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.800
and society.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.440
You won't return here again.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.280
These three years of high school

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.000
will be your fondest memories.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.960
Cherish them.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.360
What do teachers hope for?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.000
One day,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.520
I look at my phone,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.440
or the newspaper,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.200
and say,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.840
"This person was my student."

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.000
I don't know what you'll become

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.080
in the future.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.160
Some of you may struggle.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.880
I don't like doing business.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.240
Nor do I want to inherit my dad's business.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.240
Some may not achieve much.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.320
I never thought

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.000
the last to see Su Ruo off

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.200
would be me.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.200
Some may have a tough life.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.280
Some wounds

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760
never heal.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.840
You'll feel lost,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.880
disappointed,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.600
unable to find your way.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.080
You'll hesitate,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080
feel lonely,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.880
and lose motivation.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.040
All these years,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.920
you've worked here.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.960
For many years.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.000
It's been tough, right?

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.440
What isn't tough nowadays?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.920
But I hope you always remember this year.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.000
Remember your youth at its best,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.640
and how hard you fought.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.760
Bye.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.280
Su Ruo.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.400
Go home.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.200
I'm not waiting for Yu Xingchen today.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.560
It's getting late.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.440
Be careful heading home alone.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.720
No wonder you're applying to police school.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.400
You already sound like Officer Tang.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.880
I applied to civil aviation too.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.960
Still haven't decided where to go.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.120
That's nice.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.760
We'll have a classmate who becomes a cop.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.040
That must feel really safe.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.440
If anything happens in the future,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.560
we'll rely on Officer Tang to help us.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.880
Don't say weird things this late at night.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.240
What could possibly happen?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.640
Su Ruo.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.560
Does that person know you?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.480
He's been staring at you.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.080
Is he your family?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.600
My uncle.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.640
I'm heading off.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.400
Okay.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.240
Bye.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.040
No more buses.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.920
There should be one more, right?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.600
No idea why it hasn't come yet.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.400
You worked hard today.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.240
Heading home this late.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520
Finished all the mock exam papers.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.640
Today went pretty well.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.800
If you ask me,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.240
you should've gone home earlier.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.920
You could've left with Su Ruo.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.960
Su Ruo just left.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.840
Her uncle came to get her.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.760
What's wrong?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.440
Which way did she go?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.640
That way.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.720
Yu Xingchen.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.880
Yu Xingchen, stay calm.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.920
Su Ruo's uncle isn't a bad person.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.600
He just loses control after drinking.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.520
No need to be so nervous.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.600
But what if her uncle

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.800
drank again today?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.760
What if he loses control again?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.400
Su Ruo's accident happens fifteen years later.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.080
She's totally safe right now.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.200
But...

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.160
I've already changed everything.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.880
Who knows what could happen now?

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.600
RuoRuo.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.440
The college entrance exam is coming.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.360
Come back and stay here.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.600
I tidied up your room.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520
Where are you going?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.720
I have somewhere to stay.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.280
Are you okay?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.120
Su Ruo.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.920
There are so many things I want to do for you.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.360
But I...

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.360
don't know what else I can do for you.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.160
It feels like everything I should do

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.960
is already done.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.120
I also have a lot to say

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.440
to you.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.280
But...

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.800
I don't know what to say.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.760
Feels like everything I should say

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.000
has already been said.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.600
But...

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.640
I know what I should say to you.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.960
And I just happen to know

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.000
what I want to do with you.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.440
What do you want to do with me?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.800
I want to be with Yu Xingchen

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.640
and get into the same university.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.720
Study together.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.840
I'll major in education.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.240
You can study whatever you want.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.640
We should always be together.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.560
Yu Xingchen.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.560
What do you want to say to me?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.800
Su Ruo.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.920
Don't be with Ren Nan.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.040
Why bring him up?

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.760
No.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.240
Not just Ren Nan.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.280
Don't be with anyone else.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.240
Whether before the exam

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.480
or in the future,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.080
a year from now,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.240
fifteen years from now,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.720
never be with anyone else.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.320
Okay?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.680
Why?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.600
Why not be with someone else?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.400
Are you trying to say

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.480
you like me?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.240
Are you trying to say you like me?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.240
Yes.
