THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:01.750
MANAGING DIRECTOR KIM NAK-SU

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.518
How does it feel?

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.355
It doesn't bother me at all.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.525
Really?

00:01:27.317 --> 00:01:28.485
That's a relief.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.907
This is how it all started.

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.120
You hit a hole-in-one,
something that was never meant for you.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.915
From then on,
everything started going downhill.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.169
Man.

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:48.755
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.134
MANAGING DIRECTOR KIM NAK-SU

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.512
This could have actually been real.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.641
What are you going to do?

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:02.436
You got fired, lost your severance,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:04.896
and you still have
so many years ahead of you.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.817
You have to pay a few million won
every month. Right?

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:13.947
I just have to sort things out

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:17.075
one by one, just like now.

00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:19.411
I can do it.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:21.538
Just keep on working
as a designated driver?

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:24.291
Struggling to pay the interest?

00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:26.877
You think you can really live like that?

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:29.212
No.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:32.007
Nak-su.

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:33.925
You can't.

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.304
You…

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:42.476
will never be happy living like that.

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:50.150
Let's just see

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.986
who's right in the end.

00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:25.977
Gosh. The condensation is pretty bad.

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:28.897
That's because the last tenant
didn't ventilate properly.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.066
If you re-wallpaper that spot,
it'll look good as new.

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.360
How much did you say this place was?

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:36.321
A 100 million won deposit
with a monthly rent of 1.6 million.

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:40.450
Or a 200 million won deposit
with a monthly rent of 1.3 million.

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:44.246
I don't think I can put down
a larger deposit.

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.332
Ma'am, if this is over your budget,

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:50.126
you'll have to look outside of Seoul.

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:54.005
Okay.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.886
Sir, I'm almost there.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.848
We're already inside
and looking at the place.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.976
-You are?
-We arrived a bit early.

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.103
So I rang the bell
to check if anyone was here.

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:10.063
Turns out your husband was home.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:16.903
Hi, honey.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.824
As I was saying,

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:23.910
when the kids upstairs start stomping
and running around,

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:27.372
it makes me think,
"Wow, time flies. They've grown so much."

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:31.042
And the guy next door
hacks up a lung at night,

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.295
-so I worry about him.
-You can hear all that?

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:35.672
Of course. You hear everything.

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:37.424
How much are the utility fees?

00:04:37.507 --> 00:04:39.384
-The utility fees--
-The utility fees?

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:42.721
They're not that bad
if you wear a puffer jacket in the winter.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.472
No.

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.558
I can explain everything
in detail for you.

00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:47.601
Did you see the kitchen?

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.227
-I told them about it.
-No, it's okay.

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:53.565
If you take a closer look,
it's a very nice place.

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:55.358
Yes, we'll be in touch.

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:57.611
Okay. Please do.

00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:09.289
I told you. I've got this.

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:10.832
Take it off the market.

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.042
Honey.

00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.630
I'm not selling the apartment.

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:19.174
Answer me.

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:22.218
Answer me.

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.527
No, that's not it.
I'm not getting any calls at all.

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.155
Sir, I'm checking now,

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:44.074
and you have a recent accident
on your record.

00:05:44.157 --> 00:05:46.952
But I filed an insurance claim
and settled everything.

00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:49.955
Yes, but accident histories and complaints

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:52.290
are all reflected
in the dispatch algorithm.

00:05:52.374 --> 00:05:55.585
I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.212
Damn it.

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:00.256
What the hell?

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.104
Okay.

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:16.564
It's clean on the inside.

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.234
I'd say about 24 or 25 million won.

00:06:19.317 --> 00:06:22.195
I'll try to get you more from the dealer.
What do you say?

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:26.574
Okay.

00:06:30.453 --> 00:06:31.621
Then I'll call him tomorrow.

00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:36.126
I have some work
to finish up in the office.

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.711
Clear everything out of the car.

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:40.005
Can I use your car washing supplies?

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:42.590
Sure. Go ahead.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.974
I never took you
to the beach on the weekend.

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:54.602
Just work, home, work, home… I'm sorry.

00:06:57.105 --> 00:06:58.648
You were a good car.

00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:06.197
You still at it?

00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:08.825
-That's good enough. Let's go.
-All right.

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:12.037
You're selling it tomorrow.
Just wipe the dust off.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.705
I'll be done soon.

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:21.254
-Need a hand?
-No, it's fine.

00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:22.297
You know what?

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.466
I'll turn off the lights,
so you can go ahead.

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:25.675
I'll close up.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.178
You punk. Barging in here
in the middle of the night…

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:31.222
Go on.

00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:36.579
EPISODE 11
B+

00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:39.916
It's a shame, but it is what it is.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.711
Then we'll just have fun
by ourselves this time.

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:46.506
Yes, of course.

00:08:49.676 --> 00:08:51.469
That bastard.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.728
-Jeong-tae?
-Hello, Mr. Yoon.

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:06.693
Sang-pil from LK
can't make it to golf this week.

00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:09.028
Do you know anyone you could bring--

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:11.197
I was just about to call you, actually.

00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.826
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can make it this time.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.371
Really?

00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:20.123
Yes. Well…

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:22.458
I'll call you, Jeong-tae.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.502
Okay, I under--

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:25.753
Hell--

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:29.632
TU
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR YOON

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:30.675
I spoke with Jeong-tae.

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:33.178
…the reason it's not a big factor
is phone anxiety.

00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:38.558
Basically, they feel anxious
about making phone calls.

00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.809
OKAY, THANK YOU

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:42.020
In fact, a survey targeting Gen Z--

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.981
-Let go of me.
-Hold on.

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:55.325
What's going on?

00:09:58.536 --> 00:09:59.412
So-yeon, continue.

00:10:00.788 --> 00:10:03.291
Sung-gu, what are you doing?

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:05.126
Let us join the meeting.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.462
It's the sales strategy meeting
for next year, isn't it?

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.590
Aren't we part of the team?
You are our team leader, right?

00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:11.925
I apologize, sir.

00:10:12.008 --> 00:10:13.009
Sung-gu.

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:14.928
Let's go.

00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:17.055
Sung-gu.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:20.767
I know you're upset about
the recent performance reviews, but--

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.685
This isn't about the reviews.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.440
We're sick and tired
of being treated like we're invisible.

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:33.404
Ik-hyeon, do you feel the same way?

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.661
In the past few months,
the only time we've been in this room

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:44.123
was when Mr. Kim Nak-su was here
to present as an outside contractor.

00:10:44.207 --> 00:10:45.667
You're crossing the line here.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.836
What do you all think you're doing?

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.421
-Come on!
-Jun-seop.

00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:52.131
That's enough.

00:10:55.468 --> 00:10:59.472
I suppose
that was an oversight on my part.

00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:02.016
All right. Let's all have this meeting.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.393
Have a seat.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.104
So-yeon, please continue.

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:08.564
Okay.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.695
So, instead of lowering
the monthly base fee for unlimited plans,

00:11:13.778 --> 00:11:15.947
-voice calls will be limited--
-Ms. Kwon.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.783
Can you give a rough estimate
of data use by gender and time of day

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:21.119
for people in their twenties and thirties?

00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:22.453
Excuse me?

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.832
Well, I don't have my laptop--

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:26.833
I know.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.085
I said, "a rough estimate."

00:11:30.295 --> 00:11:32.755
So you can't answer
without looking at the data.

00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:36.175
Sung-gu, can you tell me about

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:39.429
our competitors' OTT-linked plans
that are starting early next year?

00:11:39.512 --> 00:11:42.348
You can look at your laptop
since you have it.

00:11:47.812 --> 00:11:50.565
First, half of the data usage by women
in their twenties and thirties--

00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:52.317
Ik-hyeon.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.110
At your level,

00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:56.946
you should be embarrassed
to be the only one on the team

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.448
rattling that off.

00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:01.451
I was actually doing you a favor.

00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:03.578
I gave Team 1 and Team 2 some time

00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:06.998
so you could focus on your main tasks
and gain insights independently.

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.791
But for you to see that
as unfair treatment

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.626
and take it so personally, I find it…

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.921
disheartening.

00:12:14.464 --> 00:12:15.548
Personally…

00:12:16.674 --> 00:12:20.678
it makes me wonder how
I'm supposed to run the sales division.

00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:27.143
Mr. Baek.

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:28.686
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:31.773
What's going on?

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:34.442
-Why is it so tense in here?
-I'm sorry, sir.

00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:37.779
I'd like to finish our discussion.

00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:42.909
Everyone, this isn't a social club.
This is a place of business.

00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:46.746
Wouldn't it be more productive

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:50.208
to work on your professional development

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:52.293
than to complain about unfair treatment?

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:56.672
I'll keep an eye on you.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.926
But for today, I'd like you to leave.

00:13:11.396 --> 00:13:14.232
Mr. Baek, if you don't mind,
please have a seat.

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:17.944
So-yeon, let's continue.

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:21.614
All right, I'll resume the presentation.

00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:23.950
Sixty-three percent of Gen Z have stated

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:27.787
they prefer texting
and messaging apps over phone calls.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.082
In line with this, we can package
add-on OTT services

00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:33.876
to encourage an increase
in data consumption.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.920
The drive belt's shot too. What do we do?

00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:38.005
Leave it for now. Remind me later.

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:39.465
-Okay.
-All done.

00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:41.592
Next time, come by for a checkup,
not just for tires.

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:43.553
-We're great with imported cars too.
-Right.

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:45.847
We use genuine parts at a great price.

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:47.348
Take care now.

00:13:47.432 --> 00:13:49.725
TRUSTED PLACE FOR TIRES

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:50.893
Goodbye.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.481
Nak-su.

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:57.567
-Yes?
-So, I got a call.

00:13:58.359 --> 00:13:59.861
It's about your car.

00:13:59.944 --> 00:14:02.113
You'll only get
about 20 million won for it.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:03.531
Twenty?

00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:06.659
That car is fully featured.

00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:07.869
It's an older model,

00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:09.996
and the engine warranty
is about to expire.

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:12.498
Damn it.

00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:13.916
So what do you say?

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:19.172
Check somewhere else.
See if you can get another million for it.

00:14:20.798 --> 00:14:21.966
I'm leaving.

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:24.385
Hey.

00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:27.013
All right. Thanks.

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:28.556
No, that's not it.

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:31.601
See this SUV there? That one.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:34.854
How about you give it a wash?

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.564
What?

00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:39.233
When you're done, wash that sedan
Ho-jun's working on over there.

00:14:39.317 --> 00:14:42.153
Put some real effort into it
and give it a good wash.

00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:44.572
Wait, what?

00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:46.407
I just… Wait.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.535
Since you came all this way,

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:52.413
you might as well earn some money
for the ride home. Here.

00:14:52.497 --> 00:14:54.081
-Okay?
-What?

00:15:05.843 --> 00:15:06.928
Yes, Mr. Baek.

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:11.891
About that golf game this weekend

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:15.019
with the sales directors
from the three major telecoms…

00:15:15.102 --> 00:15:16.604
I think we'll have to cancel.

00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:18.397
No one's available.

00:15:18.898 --> 00:15:20.358
Really?

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:23.486
That's disappointing.

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:27.156
I'll call the golf course
and the restaurant to cancel.

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:30.535
Are you really disappointed?

00:15:33.204 --> 00:15:34.121
Excuse me?

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:40.920
Please excuse me.

00:15:41.003 --> 00:15:41.879
MR. HWANG TAE-SAN

00:15:41.963 --> 00:15:44.257
Enjoy your lunch, sir.

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:46.300
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:49.929
Everyone can make it this weekend.

00:15:50.012 --> 00:15:51.055
Yes.

00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:09.949
What's Kim Nak-su up to these days?

00:16:10.032 --> 00:16:10.992
Excuse me?

00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:12.868
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:14.412
Is anyone in touch with him?

00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:20.668
Round two is on me!

00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.341
Well, are you or not?

00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:28.593
I don't think so, sir.

00:16:30.344 --> 00:16:32.054
Jeez, you guys…

00:16:34.974 --> 00:16:36.392
All right. Get back to work.

00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:41.647
Why do you think he's looking for him?

00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:44.650
Hey, you're back.

00:16:45.192 --> 00:16:47.236
You washed my car!

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.071
Since you said you'd be a while,

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:51.657
we gave it a wash after the repair.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.285
That guy did it.

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:55.703
Thank you.

00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:58.873
He did such a good job.

00:16:59.373 --> 00:17:00.499
How much do I owe you?

00:17:01.292 --> 00:17:02.752
How much for a car wash here?

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.296
You're the owner, so you decide.

00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:07.882
It's on the house.

00:17:08.507 --> 00:17:10.760
This is too good a wash
to be on the house.

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:13.304
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it today.

00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:14.972
-All right. I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.974
-Thanks again.
-Take care.

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:19.393
-Okay.
-Jeez.

00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:20.436
Bye.

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:29.487
What do you mean, "on the house"?

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.031
You said I should earn cash
for my ride home.

00:17:35.493 --> 00:17:36.494
Here.

00:17:38.788 --> 00:17:39.664
Forget it.

00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:41.415
You earned at least this much.

00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:43.042
I said forget it.

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.252
Come on. Don't.

00:17:45.336 --> 00:17:47.088
I got a new regular, thanks to you.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:48.673
Jeez.

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:53.844
Nak-su.

00:17:54.595 --> 00:17:55.513
What?

00:17:56.013 --> 00:17:57.306
Why don't you do this for real?

00:17:58.933 --> 00:17:59.809
Do what?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.438
Do you want me to wash cars?

00:18:05.314 --> 00:18:07.400
-Gosh.
-I'm serious.

00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:09.318
You have a knack for it.

00:18:09.402 --> 00:18:12.697
Waxing, interior steaming,
and disinfecting for a 2.5-hour service.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.323
For 50,000 won?

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.283
Just three cars a day.

00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:19.537
We'll get you a proper uniform.

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:23.165
That stuff matters.
You gotta have that expert vibe.

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:27.086
And don't come shuffling around
in slippers like you did today.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:28.587
Who said I'd do it?

00:18:29.255 --> 00:18:30.881
Hey.

00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:34.427
Why not shave your head?
You'd look like a master.

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:36.804
I said I'm not doing it.

00:18:39.432 --> 00:18:40.474
Unbelievable.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.982
Three times 50,000 is 150,000.

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:50.985
And 150,000 times 22 is…

00:18:53.612 --> 00:18:55.364
150,000 times 22.

00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:58.659
It's 3.3 million.

00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:16.510
What are you doing?

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:20.639
Can you get my phone?

00:19:24.226 --> 00:19:26.061
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:34.570
Here.

00:19:39.742 --> 00:19:41.035
Answer it.

00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:42.411
It's fine.

00:19:43.037 --> 00:19:44.705
Are you not picking up because I'm here?

00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:47.208
What are you talking about?

00:19:48.626 --> 00:19:50.066
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:19:56.967 --> 00:19:57.927
I'm…

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:00.846
starting work tomorrow.

00:20:01.472 --> 00:20:02.389
Where?

00:20:03.349 --> 00:20:04.850
My brother's auto shop.

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:06.435
Chang-su's?

00:20:07.186 --> 00:20:08.395
What will you be doing?

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:09.647
You know, stuff.

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:12.650
What can you do there?

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:15.069
Are you getting into
something dangerous again?

00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:17.947
No, it's not like that.

00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:20.783
I'll be washing cars.

00:20:36.382 --> 00:20:37.716
Should I pack you a lunch?

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.261
No, it's fine.

00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:05.703
I hate that I look good in this.

00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:08.622
REFRESHING CAR WASH

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:12.001
Looking at your car's service history,
everything else looks fine.

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.669
-You just need to change the oil.
-Okay.

00:21:13.752 --> 00:21:15.629
And top up the coolant for her.

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:17.047
-Yes, I will.
-Good.

00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:21.510
Anyway, since it will be a few hours
before you pick it up,

00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:24.054
why don't you get it detailed?

00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:25.848
Detailed?

00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:28.934
He's a former
Sales General Manager at ACT.

00:21:29.018 --> 00:21:30.436
Why would you tell her that?

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.855
Is that right?

00:21:33.898 --> 00:21:34.773
Well then…

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:36.483
Yes, please.

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:38.235
Great, thank you.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.282
ONLY THREE CARS A DAY!
50,000 WON

00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.213
This is so satisfying.

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:32.206
She's really inspecting it.

00:22:40.047 --> 00:22:42.257
You're so meticulous.

00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:43.634
It's like a new car.

00:22:44.218 --> 00:22:46.637
Sales is all about the details.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.846
That's right.

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:49.974
How much is it?

00:22:51.558 --> 00:22:54.019
-It's 50,000 won.
-Okay.

00:23:03.028 --> 00:23:04.154
I feel like the kimchi

00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:07.658
cooks faster on the stone grill.

00:23:08.575 --> 00:23:09.785
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:23:09.868 --> 00:23:11.704
-Two more servings, please.
-Okay.

00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:13.789
Slow down, will you?

00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:15.833
You're going to puke, man.

00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:17.543
One car and I'll work it all off.

00:23:17.626 --> 00:23:19.086
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:21.463
When's our stone-grilled
jjajang ramyeon coming?

00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:23.716
-I'll bring it right out.
-Okay.

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:26.010
-Interesting.
-What is?

00:23:26.635 --> 00:23:28.554
You seem to enjoy it.

00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:30.514
It doesn't matter if I enjoy it.

00:23:32.016 --> 00:23:33.017
Here you are.

00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:36.311
Look at this.

00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:38.105
-What is it?
-Jjajang ramyeon.

00:23:39.148 --> 00:23:40.315
Your phone's ringing.

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:41.316
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:43.986
Do you just pour it onto the grill?

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:45.154
Yes.

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:48.866
-Gosh.
-Enjoy.

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:57.166
This is delicious.

00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:59.001
It's seriously good.

00:23:59.084 --> 00:24:01.128
SEOKAM PORK BARBEQUE

00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:03.839
The number you have dialed is currently--

00:24:03.922 --> 00:24:06.300
That punk. Damn it.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.766
Hey.

00:24:14.683 --> 00:24:15.976
Try calling Kim Nak-su.

00:24:17.102 --> 00:24:18.896
-Right now?
-Yes, now.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.778
Yes, just a moment.

00:24:30.866 --> 00:24:33.577
The number you have dialed is currently--

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.787
It's off, sir.

00:24:38.832 --> 00:24:40.000
Have you guys eaten?

00:24:40.084 --> 00:24:41.293
No, not yet.

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:44.421
Shall we have lunch together, sir?

00:24:44.505 --> 00:24:45.422
-Actually--
-Then…

00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:47.966
go grab some food with this,

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:50.094
stop by the department store,

00:24:50.594 --> 00:24:53.388
and pick me up a beef short ribs gift set.
Get the most expensive one.

00:24:53.472 --> 00:24:54.556
Yes, sir.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.724
-All right.
-Yes, sir.

00:24:55.808 --> 00:24:56.809
Yes, sir.

00:24:58.352 --> 00:25:01.146
Looks like he needs to ask him
for a big favor.

00:25:02.106 --> 00:25:03.190
I'll call you.

00:25:13.534 --> 00:25:14.618
Gosh.

00:25:16.411 --> 00:25:17.496
Nak-su.

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.628
Your favorite.

00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:28.549
Take it. It's heavy.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.469
-Why are you here?
-You weren't answering your phone.

00:25:32.553 --> 00:25:34.346
Ever wonder why I don't answer?

00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:37.182
I did.

00:25:39.852 --> 00:25:41.353
Come on. Take it.

00:25:41.436 --> 00:25:43.188
I don't want it. Take it back.

00:25:44.565 --> 00:25:45.816
Jeez.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:48.735
Fine, then get in the car.

00:25:48.819 --> 00:25:50.654
Let's just talk for a minute.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:52.364
About what?

00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:54.575
You stubborn punk.

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.910
-Nak-su, just for a second.
-It's already listed

00:25:56.994 --> 00:26:00.664
for 20 million won below the market price.
I don't think we can go any lower.

00:26:00.747 --> 00:26:03.041
Is there enough parking here?

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.626
Of course.

00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:11.341
You can always find a spot,
even if you come home late.

00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.135
Call me.

00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:14.428
-Okay.
-All right.

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:21.768
It's been a while, Ha-jin.

00:26:21.852 --> 00:26:23.395
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:26:30.527 --> 00:26:32.738
I've brought some beef short ribs.

00:26:32.821 --> 00:26:34.615
His favorite.

00:26:35.324 --> 00:26:36.700
Thank you.

00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:42.998
I feel bad that I'm always
the one receiving things.

00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:44.791
Last time you came,

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.753
I should have given you
something better than side dishes.

00:26:47.836 --> 00:26:48.962
Don't say that.

00:26:49.046 --> 00:26:51.632
You would have accepted it then.

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:55.969
And I assume you would've
taken better care of him too.

00:26:56.053 --> 00:26:57.054
Right?

00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:06.897
I'd like to…

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.650
speak with him for a moment.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.693
Where are you going?

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:16.448
We're just grabbing a quick beer nearby.

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:20.452
You've come all this way.
Why go out for drinks?

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:22.704
Just have them at our place.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:28.752
I wouldn't want to impose.

00:27:29.544 --> 00:27:31.088
Nak-su, get in. Let's go.

00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:32.923
Honey.

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:37.261
This shouldn't be discussed at home.

00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:39.972
I'll be right back after we talk.

00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:44.935
Then I'll see you later.

00:27:45.727 --> 00:27:47.312
Take this.

00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:49.022
Please.

00:27:50.065 --> 00:27:51.400
Come on.

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:52.651
There.

00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:57.906
-Nak-su, let's go. Get in.
-All right.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.616
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.867
Okay, all right.

00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.208
Well, then…

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:10.502
He'll be back soon.

00:28:30.314 --> 00:28:32.899
It's been a while
since you've been here, hasn't it?

00:28:34.693 --> 00:28:37.362
When I was an assistant manager
and you were an associate,

00:28:37.446 --> 00:28:40.490
we used to come here
and complain so much about the company.

00:28:40.574 --> 00:28:43.035
We said, "Let's never be like them."

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:45.912
"Let's fix this damn company for good."

00:28:58.592 --> 00:29:02.596
After you left the company,
I came up here by myself once.

00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:05.265
It was only then

00:29:05.891 --> 00:29:08.643
that I realized I'd made a huge mistake.

00:29:10.604 --> 00:29:12.147
I'm sorry, Kim Nak-su.

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:14.649
Please forgive me.

00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:16.777
Why bring up the past?

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.695
Forget it.

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:21.448
Go sweet-talk Do Jin-woo.
You picked him over me.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.158
Do Jin-woo?

00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:29.414
He betrayed me and sided
with Executive Director Hwang Tae-san.

00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:34.503
The golf group I arranged with
the three major telecom sales directors?

00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:38.006
Do Jin-woo pushed me aside
and gave Hwang Tae-san my place.

00:29:38.757 --> 00:29:40.467
They shut me out. Damn it.

00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:45.305
They're just trying
to take it all for themselves.

00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:48.183
At this rate, I don't think
I'll get my executive contract renewed.

00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:50.060
You're just reaping what you sowed.

00:29:50.143 --> 00:29:51.728
It's the same for your team.

00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:53.397
Do Jin-woo?

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.817
He's subtly excluding Team 1
and cornering them.

00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:59.194
They won't last long either.

00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:01.571
Why the hell are you telling me all this?

00:30:05.117 --> 00:30:06.076
I need your help.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.411
With what?

00:30:07.494 --> 00:30:09.371
I don't even work
for that company anymore.

00:30:09.454 --> 00:30:12.082
Nemo, Taejeong, iBroad.

00:30:12.707 --> 00:30:14.918
You're close with
the working-level contacts there.

00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:19.423
Get them in on the upcoming
private network bid.

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:21.967
Even if the three major telecoms
scheme together,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.510
if smaller companies suddenly jump in,

00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:25.470
they won't be able to control
the winning bid.

00:30:25.554 --> 00:30:28.515
Their little golf group or whatever
won't save the big three.

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:34.688
So you're secretly planning
to betray your own side.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.233
How can you think that
as an ACT executive?

00:30:38.316 --> 00:30:41.445
You're willing to harm the company
just to hang on to your job?

00:30:41.528 --> 00:30:45.407
So what if I want to stick around
a little longer?

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.533
Is that so wrong?

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:49.828
That's just greedy.
You've earned enough already.

00:30:49.911 --> 00:30:51.663
You could go to any other company.

00:30:51.746 --> 00:30:54.374
Just let it go. Why are you being
so pathetic about this?

00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:55.417
What's pathetic?

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.252
You are. You're being very pathetic.

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:01.590
And you weren't?

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:04.092
Didn't you want to be like me?

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.597
You think you would've been any different
if you'd become an executive?

00:31:09.723 --> 00:31:12.851
I'm just honest about what I want
and I'm trying to protect it!

00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:15.770
What's so pathetic about that?

00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:19.483
I know you still have

00:31:20.192 --> 00:31:22.319
something you can't let go of.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:25.197
That's why you followed me
all the way up here.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.364
Gosh.

00:31:27.115 --> 00:31:29.034
You're talking nonsense.

00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:32.370
Nak-su, look.

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:36.708
Honestly, I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:38.835
I admit it.

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:41.421
So please just help me one last time.

00:31:43.006 --> 00:31:46.092
If this goes well,
I swear I'll find a position for you.

00:31:46.176 --> 00:31:48.428
An executive position
at a smaller company.

00:31:48.512 --> 00:31:50.639
A salary of at least 150 million won.

00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:57.062
I keep my promises.

00:32:00.065 --> 00:32:01.024
I'm begging you.

00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:03.610
Jeez.

00:32:09.658 --> 00:32:12.327
How am I supposed
to get Taejeong and the others

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.954
to enter the bid?

00:32:14.037 --> 00:32:15.413
Don't be ridiculous.

00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:18.667
Come on.

00:32:19.918 --> 00:32:21.169
You know how.

00:32:21.878 --> 00:32:25.090
Entertain them
or find some dirt to blackmail them.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.385
Or threaten
to cut their contracts with ACT.

00:32:30.554 --> 00:32:33.139
That's what you always had me do.

00:32:33.223 --> 00:32:36.226
Nak-su, this is how we both survive

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:40.313
and protect your people from being treated
like outcasts under Do Jin-woo.

00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:42.691
This is actually a good thing.

00:32:58.957 --> 00:33:00.834
I told you I'm not selling the apartment.

00:33:00.917 --> 00:33:04.087
-Why are you having people come by?
-You answer me first.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.298
What did he say?
Did he offer you another job?

00:33:08.341 --> 00:33:09.801
Don't do it. You hear?

00:33:11.469 --> 00:33:13.722
The people who saw the apartment today
were all interested

00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:14.973
and said they'd call tomorrow.

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:17.601
Selling it will get us
through the worst of it.

00:33:18.226 --> 00:33:19.936
You don't have to push yourself.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.440
So we'll sell this place
to pay off the loan.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.483
Where are we going to live?

00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:27.611
You must have thought about it.

00:33:29.821 --> 00:33:31.531
A multi-family building
in Gyeonggi Province.

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:32.616
For rent?

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.702
Yes, for rent.

00:33:36.244 --> 00:33:38.830
Given our situation,
we have no other choice.

00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:46.087
Now it's your turn. Answer me.

00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:47.631
Will you work with him?

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:53.511
Answer me now.
Are you going to work with Jeong-tae?

00:33:58.183 --> 00:33:59.809
Answer me!

00:34:00.602 --> 00:34:02.729
Fine, I won't!

00:34:05.231 --> 00:34:07.108
I said I won't, okay?

00:34:07.651 --> 00:34:09.611
Let's just throw this away.

00:34:19.245 --> 00:34:22.749
My passenger had been day-drinking,
so he was screaming his head off.

00:34:22.832 --> 00:34:25.418
I got startled and slammed
right into the guardrail.

00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:27.337
That was a close call. Are you okay?

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.005
No, I'm fine.

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:31.174
-Will it take long?
-Not at all.

00:34:31.257 --> 00:34:33.134
We'll fix it quickly
so you can drive it tonight.

00:34:33.218 --> 00:34:34.511
-Okay.
-Good.

00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:37.263
Right, let's check the rest.

00:34:37.347 --> 00:34:38.932
This part looks fine.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:42.936
Oh man.

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:48.525
I don't know what he ate,
but the smell is just…

00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:52.570
Anyway, please hurry.
I haven't made my quota this month.

00:34:52.654 --> 00:34:54.197
Gosh.

00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:56.282
Don't worry, I got this.

00:34:56.366 --> 00:34:59.411
Are you sure? Thanks, man.

00:34:59.494 --> 00:35:00.412
Thank you.

00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:02.789
Yeong-gil, get the wrench. Let's hurry.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.417
And do the reset quickly, will you?

00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:22.600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:35:22.684 --> 00:35:24.644
-Take care.
-Drive safely.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.901
Hey, good work.

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:33.903
-Let's go get some food.
-You go ahead.

00:35:34.654 --> 00:35:36.448
Do you want me to get you some gimbap?

00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:37.782
I don't feel like eating.

00:35:39.868 --> 00:35:41.619
All right. Get some rest.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:44.205
-Let's go.
-He's not eating?

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:45.915
How could he have an appetite?

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:47.542
-Go on, you guys.
-Okay.

00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:48.960
See you.

00:35:55.592 --> 00:35:56.801
ASSISTANT MANAGER JUNG SUNG-GU

00:36:00.555 --> 00:36:01.806
Sir, are you coming?

00:36:02.348 --> 00:36:03.641
Yes, let's go.

00:36:06.895 --> 00:36:07.771
Hello, Sung-gu.

00:36:07.854 --> 00:36:09.939
-Mr. Kim!
-Jeez. You scared me.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.318
-Where are you, sir?
-Why do you ask?

00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:16.529
We're out of the office right now.

00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:18.281
We were talking about how we missed you,

00:36:18.364 --> 00:36:19.532
and we wanted to see you.

00:36:19.616 --> 00:36:21.284
What for? Aren't you busy?

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:23.703
Funny you should ask.
We're not busy at all.

00:36:23.787 --> 00:36:25.079
We miss you, Mr. Kim.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.373
Mr. Kim, if you're not busy,

00:36:27.457 --> 00:36:29.751
we'd like to come see you.

00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:31.711
There's something we want to discuss.

00:36:43.556 --> 00:36:45.350
-I'm off to lunch.
-Okay.

00:36:45.433 --> 00:36:46.559
Enjoy your meal.

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:47.936
Enjoy your meal.

00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:51.356
Aren't you eating?

00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:53.066
I actually…

00:36:53.858 --> 00:36:55.443
brought my lunch.

00:36:55.527 --> 00:36:57.695
Wow, how frugal.

00:36:58.905 --> 00:37:01.366
Before you eat, let's have a quick chat.

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:03.576
Okay.

00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:10.792
You understand, right?

00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:14.045
Wait, but why?

00:37:14.128 --> 00:37:17.465
I closed the deals on half of the studios
and two-bedroom units

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:19.092
managed by this office.

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:20.802
I know.

00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:24.097
And you've been taking your commissions
without any delays.

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:28.017
That's an interesting way to put it.

00:37:29.018 --> 00:37:30.019
What do you mean?

00:37:30.645 --> 00:37:33.481
You make it sound like
I took money I wasn't supposed to get.

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:35.692
I earned it, you know.

00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:39.779
I'm the one who climbed up steep hills
to show units, convinced landlords,

00:37:39.863 --> 00:37:42.282
and drew up the contracts. I did it all.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.286
And I'm the one who pays the rent here,
covers the utility fees,

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:49.455
pays for advertising,
and registers the listings. That's all.

00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:50.665
I'm sorry.

00:37:50.748 --> 00:37:54.002
If you feel so wronged,
go open your own agency somewhere else.

00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:55.461
I'm sure you'd do great.

00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:01.301
Okay. I understand.

00:38:01.926 --> 00:38:03.761
So today is my last day?

00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:06.681
Yes. Thank you for understanding.

00:38:06.764 --> 00:38:07.807
Enjoy your lunch.

00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:09.934
Before I leave,

00:38:10.435 --> 00:38:13.354
I'd like a clear copy
of my settlement statement, please.

00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:15.565
Why?

00:38:15.648 --> 00:38:19.402
I have something to compare it with.
Would that be too much trouble?

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.113
No.

00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:26.034
Here you go.

00:38:27.368 --> 00:38:28.953
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

00:38:29.037 --> 00:38:29.913
Enjoy your meal.

00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:47.180
Why is everyone so fidgety?

00:38:47.263 --> 00:38:48.473
What? No, we're not.

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:53.311
What did you want to talk about?

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:54.395
Spit it out.

00:38:56.856 --> 00:38:57.732
Mr. Kim.

00:38:58.942 --> 00:39:01.319
Did you by any chance meet with Mr. Baek?

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:04.113
How did you know?

00:39:04.197 --> 00:39:06.908
I was the one who picked out
the beef short ribs.

00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:08.034
He did.

00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:12.705
What did he say?

00:39:13.998 --> 00:39:17.001
Nothing much.
Just asked for a little help with a job.

00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:19.087
-So what did you decide?
-Hey.

00:39:20.254 --> 00:39:22.507
Is Do Jin-woo giving you a hard time?

00:39:24.092 --> 00:39:25.009
Is he?

00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:28.763
Jeez.

00:39:28.846 --> 00:39:30.515
I think his goal is

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:33.810
to replace us next year
with new people in the sales division.

00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:38.398
Mr. Kim. Is work
keeping you busy these days?

00:39:39.357 --> 00:39:40.316
Why do you ask?

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.319
I don't know what Mr. Baek
asked for your help with.

00:39:43.403 --> 00:39:46.906
But whatever it is,
it must be a job where you're needed.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.825
Something only you can do.

00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:52.370
Don't you think it might be
worth giving it a try?

00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:55.039
It could lead to another opportunity.

00:39:55.873 --> 00:39:57.750
And just in case,

00:39:58.376 --> 00:40:00.962
-if that job has something to do with us--
-Sung-gu.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.756
I'm just saying.

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:08.386
Please consider what's at stake
for us before making your call.

00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:10.680
I just want things to be like before.

00:40:10.763 --> 00:40:13.558
I want us all to be working together.

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:15.685
Mr. Kim.

00:40:18.646 --> 00:40:19.856
Eat up.

00:40:29.198 --> 00:40:31.200
What are you going to do about this?

00:40:31.284 --> 00:40:33.369
Do you know how much
this genuine leather seat costs?

00:40:33.453 --> 00:40:34.620
What's going on?

00:40:34.704 --> 00:40:35.872
I messed up a little.

00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:36.831
What?

00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:38.458
Gosh.

00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.793
Sir, I'm so sorry.

00:40:40.877 --> 00:40:42.754
-Ho-jun! Get the leather cleaner.
-Yes?

00:40:42.837 --> 00:40:44.130
-Okay.
-Will that get it out?

00:40:44.213 --> 00:40:45.673
If it doesn't,

00:40:45.757 --> 00:40:47.967
I'll call a specialist
or find another way.

00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:50.011
I'm very sorry.

00:40:54.182 --> 00:40:55.266
Hey, Nak-su.

00:40:55.767 --> 00:40:56.768
I'm sorry.

00:40:56.851 --> 00:40:59.312
How can someone in the service industry
be so unprofessional?

00:40:59.395 --> 00:41:00.897
-Sir, here.
-Thanks.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.273
Go get a wet sponge.

00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:03.608
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:05.902
I'll take full responsibility
and restore it, so--

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:08.071
-Just clean it off already.
-Yes, sir.

00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:09.989
-Ho-jun…
-I'm having a crappy day.

00:41:10.073 --> 00:41:11.949
-I'll do it.
-It's fine. You go sit over there.

00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:14.202
-You can go inside.
-But…

00:41:27.548 --> 00:41:29.884
Nemo, Taejeong, iBroad.

00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:34.388
Get them in on the upcoming
private network bid.

00:41:35.014 --> 00:41:37.934
If this goes well,
I swear I'll find a position for you.

00:41:43.981 --> 00:41:46.317
DIRECTOR JUNG BYEONG-UK
NEMO TELECOM

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.902
CEO JANG GWON-HYEOK
IBROAD

00:41:47.985 --> 00:41:49.570
I have them.

00:41:50.822 --> 00:41:53.116
TAEJEONG TELECOM
HEO TAE-HWAN, HONG HYEON-JUN

00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:56.035
I have all of them.

00:42:18.182 --> 00:42:20.393
You told me I would be paid my share.

00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:27.108
Jeez.

00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:32.947
That's not…

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.073
What?

00:42:35.032 --> 00:42:36.117
What's going on?

00:42:37.451 --> 00:42:39.328
How many times do I have to say it?

00:42:39.412 --> 00:42:41.998
This woman is unbelievable.
How can I help you?

00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:43.249
Honey, what's wrong?

00:42:43.332 --> 00:42:45.042
Just a second.

00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:48.713
You never said anything about
deducting expenses from my commissions.

00:42:48.796 --> 00:42:50.006
I've told you a million times.

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:54.051
It's customary to split
utilities and ad fees.

00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:57.096
Isn't that what you're taking
60 percent for?

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.682
Did you not use the water cooler here?

00:42:59.765 --> 00:43:00.725
And the printer?

00:43:00.808 --> 00:43:03.853
You should've at least told me beforehand.
It's not in the contract.

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:06.355
Unbelievable. This woman is a real pain.

00:43:06.439 --> 00:43:09.358
Then give me a breakdown
of those extra expenses.

00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:11.903
-I need to know before I pay.
-Hey, lady!

00:43:11.986 --> 00:43:14.989
I hired you even though you were old,
and this is how you repay a favor?

00:43:15.072 --> 00:43:17.325
Old? Hey, watch your mouth. That's enough.

00:43:17.408 --> 00:43:19.577
-Honey, stop it. Let's go.
-Fine. I'll stop.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.746
-Just a minute, though.
-What is it?

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:23.539
"A favor"? What favor?

00:43:23.623 --> 00:43:26.000
I worked so hard for you.

00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:28.002
Is it wrong to ask
for what I rightfully earned?

00:43:28.085 --> 00:43:30.379
-Get out!
-Don't you touch her!

00:43:30.463 --> 00:43:32.882
You stay out of this! Just get out!

00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:34.759
-Out!
-Don't. Honey!

00:43:34.842 --> 00:43:36.302
-Gosh!
-I'm not leaving.

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:38.304
Not until I get what I'm owed.

00:43:38.387 --> 00:43:40.640
I've let it slide,
but now you've gone too far.

00:43:40.723 --> 00:43:42.725
You're acting like I was a terrible boss!

00:43:42.808 --> 00:43:43.768
Gosh, stop!

00:43:45.811 --> 00:43:47.855
-Let go!
-You let go!

00:43:48.356 --> 00:43:49.732
Hey, let go!

00:43:55.655 --> 00:43:57.740
That was a really ugly ending.

00:43:58.908 --> 00:44:00.701
Exactly how much does she owe you?

00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:03.079
I think it was around a million won.

00:44:04.038 --> 00:44:04.914
A million?

00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:07.625
I'm getting that money back
no matter what.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.878
Just let it go.

00:44:11.796 --> 00:44:14.215
Let it go? It's a million won!

00:44:17.385 --> 00:44:19.095
Goodness.

00:44:20.846 --> 00:44:22.348
Damn it.

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:36.320
Did you hear from the people
who saw the apartment?

00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:41.784
Yes, I agreed to sell it
to the ones who reached out first.

00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:43.202
Everything's been scheduled.

00:44:43.911 --> 00:44:44.829
Why do you ask?

00:44:46.455 --> 00:44:47.498
Text them.

00:44:48.082 --> 00:44:49.417
Tell them the deal is off.

00:44:50.751 --> 00:44:53.087
We're not selling or renting it out.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.006
I'm going to protect that apartment.

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:04.724
How?

00:45:05.975 --> 00:45:08.060
I'm going to work with Baek Jeong-tae.

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:17.695
So that's why you came to see me.

00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:21.657
I don't want to raise my voice
in that apartment anymore.

00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:24.035
It'll be our family's home
for a long time.

00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:27.079
Why?

00:45:27.621 --> 00:45:29.832
Why are you getting involved
with him again?

00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:31.792
Seriously, why?

00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:34.045
There's no reason.

00:45:34.128 --> 00:45:36.172
Beggars can't be choosers, you know?

00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:40.176
What, so you can get betrayed
and go through all that pain again?

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:48.684
Is protecting the apartment
that important?

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.021
What does it mean to you?
It's just an apartment.

00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:53.647
A block of concrete.

00:45:54.523 --> 00:45:57.401
Why are you sacrificing yourself
to protect that?

00:45:58.944 --> 00:46:00.196
I'm not sacrificing myself.

00:46:01.364 --> 00:46:03.032
You don't know anything.

00:46:04.408 --> 00:46:08.204
Yes, it all sounds great.
Living in a rental on the outskirts,

00:46:08.287 --> 00:46:11.832
washing cars at my brother's auto shop,
saving up little by little,

00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:14.251
the three of us sticking together,
cheering each other on,

00:46:14.335 --> 00:46:17.421
holding out until the day
we can move back to Seoul.

00:46:18.339 --> 00:46:19.256
That all sounds great.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.591
Yes.

00:46:21.384 --> 00:46:24.261
We can do that. What's the problem?

00:46:24.345 --> 00:46:25.721
I'm old.

00:46:28.432 --> 00:46:30.309
I'm old and tired. I'm exhausted.

00:46:34.522 --> 00:46:35.439
Honey.

00:46:36.232 --> 00:46:39.568
Do you really think I could handle
living in a place like that?

00:46:41.987 --> 00:46:45.449
In that run-down,
cramped multi-family building,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.204
I'll spend every night thinking
about that damn commercial unit I bought.

00:46:50.287 --> 00:46:53.791
I'd feel so sorry for you and Su-gyeom

00:46:53.874 --> 00:46:55.209
that I'd barely sleep.

00:46:55.835 --> 00:46:57.920
That's what would happen. I'd break down.

00:46:58.003 --> 00:47:00.548
That's why I'm fighting so hard
to stop that from happening.

00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:03.008
Why can't you see that?

00:47:11.934 --> 00:47:12.893
Okay.

00:47:15.604 --> 00:47:16.981
Finally, some honesty.

00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:20.109
In the end,

00:47:20.776 --> 00:47:23.779
it was never about
wanting to protect our home.

00:47:26.157 --> 00:47:27.158
You were

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:31.078
seething inside
while washing those cars, weren't you?

00:47:32.705 --> 00:47:34.415
Thinking, "I'm General Manager Kim."

00:47:34.498 --> 00:47:37.168
"I'm not supposed to be
doing this." Right?

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.382
All that talk about protecting
the apartment and us was just an excuse.

00:47:46.093 --> 00:47:47.761
What you really wanted to protect

00:47:48.554 --> 00:47:50.806
was that petty pride of yours.

00:48:02.693 --> 00:48:03.736
Hey.

00:48:05.654 --> 00:48:07.531
You think you're the only one getting old?

00:48:34.892 --> 00:48:37.561
Excuse me.
One more bottle of soju, please.

00:48:38.312 --> 00:48:39.188
Yes, sir.

00:48:39.271 --> 00:48:41.524
-Thank you.
-Thanks. Come again.

00:48:41.607 --> 00:48:42.650
Bye.

00:48:44.527 --> 00:48:45.653
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:47.029
One more bottle of soju.

00:48:49.532 --> 00:48:50.616
-Sir?
-Yes?

00:48:50.699 --> 00:48:51.951
I'm sorry, but we're closed now.

00:48:52.034 --> 00:48:53.827
-Why?
-We're closed.

00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:59.124
How much is the rent here?

00:49:00.209 --> 00:49:02.795
-About six, seven million?
-Hey, Jeong-ho.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.964
Do you want to move into my building?

00:49:05.047 --> 00:49:07.800
-Whatever you say.
-Three months' rent is free.

00:49:09.301 --> 00:49:10.844
-Let's get you up.
-What are you doing?

00:49:10.928 --> 00:49:12.638
-One, two, three.
-What's going on?

00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:13.889
-There we go.
-You people…

00:49:18.644 --> 00:49:19.687
What the…

00:49:20.729 --> 00:49:22.147
Not a single taxi around.

00:49:24.275 --> 00:49:27.152
Damn it. My phone's dead.

00:49:29.196 --> 00:49:30.114
Excuse me.

00:49:30.197 --> 00:49:32.908
-Yes?
-Can you please charge this for me?

00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:36.203
-We're closed.
-Sir.

00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:39.873
Which way is Gangdong-gu?

00:49:39.957 --> 00:49:41.584
Gangdong-gu?

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.713
East, west, south, north, so…

00:49:45.796 --> 00:49:47.715
It'd be somewhere over there.

00:49:48.257 --> 00:49:49.174
Okay.

00:49:49.258 --> 00:49:50.884
-Thank you.
-Right.

00:49:51.802 --> 00:49:55.055
Are you walking all the way there?

00:49:55.889 --> 00:49:56.849
I guess so.

00:49:57.933 --> 00:49:59.768
Well, the Earth is round, so…

00:50:01.353 --> 00:50:02.313
I've got to go.

00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:29.381
BUNDANG - GANGDONG-GU

00:51:01.038 --> 00:51:02.623
That sobered me up real quick.

00:51:24.728 --> 00:51:28.399
The damn ball never goes in.

00:51:29.608 --> 00:51:33.487
It had to drop right in
on that day, of all days!

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.447
Sir.

00:51:35.531 --> 00:51:38.575
Just 20 people.
Please draw up a list by next week.

00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:41.995
I'd like to apply
for voluntary retirement.

00:51:42.663 --> 00:51:44.665
You should've given him the list.

00:51:44.748 --> 00:51:46.583
They had nothing to do with me.

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:49.086
You should've
just given it to him, damn it!

00:51:49.169 --> 00:51:50.421
So, you'll take it?

00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:53.716
Talk with your wife and come back.

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:56.176
Jeez, why are you
making this so hard for me?

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.886
Don't. Let him go!

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:01.098
It's my money.
Why do I need to talk it over with anyone?

00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:03.726
How could you spend that money like that!

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.354
You crazy bastard!

00:52:08.188 --> 00:52:09.523
Damn it.

00:52:29.376 --> 00:52:30.502
How…

00:52:31.587 --> 00:52:33.756
How did it come to this?

00:52:38.844 --> 00:52:40.679
I was almost there.

00:52:40.763 --> 00:52:41.889
Kim Nak-su!

00:52:42.973 --> 00:52:43.849
The managing director.

00:52:46.685 --> 00:52:48.687
I was just one step away.

00:52:52.816 --> 00:52:54.234
I don't know anymore.

00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:58.405
I really…

00:53:00.282 --> 00:53:02.201
really don't know.

00:53:02.284 --> 00:53:04.203
What do you mean you don't know?

00:53:06.622 --> 00:53:09.041
This is all the result of your choices.

00:53:15.047 --> 00:53:16.465
I told you.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.759
You can't live like this.

00:53:19.843 --> 00:53:23.889
You'll end up choosing to work
with Baek Jeong-tae again.

00:53:28.936 --> 00:53:29.812
Mr. Kim.

00:53:30.896 --> 00:53:33.982
Let me ask you something.

00:53:39.822 --> 00:53:41.323
Why the hell…

00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:44.618
did you want to be an executive?

00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:49.414
You never even took a trip
with your family,

00:53:49.498 --> 00:53:51.458
never made it to your kid's graduation,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.961
but just worked like crazy.

00:53:54.753 --> 00:53:57.673
What were you chasing after all that time?

00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:00.092
What was it all for?

00:54:01.093 --> 00:54:02.302
Tell me.

00:54:02.386 --> 00:54:03.595
You really have to ask?

00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:04.638
Yes.

00:54:05.848 --> 00:54:07.266
I really don't know.

00:54:11.186 --> 00:54:12.187
I wanted to protect them.

00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:13.397
What?

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.567
Ha-jin, Su-gyeom, my family,

00:54:17.901 --> 00:54:20.320
my home, and my job.
Protect all of it. Is that wrong?

00:54:20.404 --> 00:54:21.405
Is that all?

00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:23.282
Really?

00:54:23.991 --> 00:54:25.993
Just be honest for once.

00:54:31.498 --> 00:54:32.708
Fine. My pride.

00:54:34.209 --> 00:54:36.378
Just like Ha-jin said,
I wanted to protect my pride.

00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:37.462
So what?

00:54:38.505 --> 00:54:39.840
Are you any different?

00:54:40.382 --> 00:54:43.719
You don't have the guts
to wash other people's cars for a living.

00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:46.054
So you're trying to leech off
Baek Jeong-tae.

00:54:46.138 --> 00:54:47.389
Aren't you?

00:54:48.432 --> 00:54:51.393
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:54:51.476 --> 00:54:52.895
What did I do?

00:54:57.733 --> 00:54:58.692
I get it.

00:55:00.569 --> 00:55:02.529
What did I do so wrong with my life?

00:55:04.156 --> 00:55:07.868
When we were young,
the world told us to just charge forward.

00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:10.996
But now…

00:55:13.957 --> 00:55:15.709
they tell us not to charge forward.

00:55:16.877 --> 00:55:18.670
They say I should reflect on myself,

00:55:18.754 --> 00:55:21.214
look around at others,
and things like that.

00:55:21.715 --> 00:55:24.259
But when I look inside myself,

00:55:25.552 --> 00:55:28.639
I'm not there. It's empty.
Completely hollow.

00:55:29.765 --> 00:55:31.266
And when I look around me,

00:55:32.601 --> 00:55:34.519
they're all riding on my back.

00:55:35.938 --> 00:55:38.106
My parents, the loans,

00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:39.858
retirement.

00:55:40.359 --> 00:55:41.360
Ha-jin.

00:55:42.277 --> 00:55:43.153
And Su-gyeom.

00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:48.659
It's so heavy.

00:55:51.036 --> 00:55:52.037
By the way,

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.581
Su-gyeom…

00:55:56.875 --> 00:55:57.960
has grown up so much.

00:56:01.505 --> 00:56:02.506
That kid…

00:56:03.507 --> 00:56:07.302
He was worried his dad
might get into an accident again.

00:56:07.386 --> 00:56:10.555
So he followed me
when I worked as a designated driver.

00:56:11.306 --> 00:56:13.141
That made me feel reassured.

00:56:14.184 --> 00:56:16.103
He gets that from his mother.

00:56:16.186 --> 00:56:17.604
Ha-jin actually…

00:56:19.147 --> 00:56:20.816
didn't say anything else.

00:56:23.235 --> 00:56:25.487
The day I retired, she simply said,

00:56:26.196 --> 00:56:27.698
"You've been through so much,"

00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:30.200
and gave me a hug.

00:56:33.328 --> 00:56:34.788
But why is Ha-jin…

00:56:36.957 --> 00:56:38.583
getting thinner and thinner?

00:56:43.213 --> 00:56:44.506
I thought…

00:56:47.676 --> 00:56:50.721
I was the one protecting them,
but I wasn't.

00:56:53.181 --> 00:56:55.267
It was Ha-jin and Su-gyeom

00:56:55.976 --> 00:56:58.520
who were quietly
watching over me from behind.

00:57:00.856 --> 00:57:02.274
And my pathetic self…

00:57:03.358 --> 00:57:04.943
I was…

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.781
clinging to that flimsy pride of mine
the entire time.

00:57:14.911 --> 00:57:15.829
Yes.

00:57:17.748 --> 00:57:18.999
Yes, that.

00:57:20.459 --> 00:57:24.254
Let's both let go of that. Okay?

00:57:29.176 --> 00:57:30.218
Mr. Kim.

00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:35.891
You've been through so much.

00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:41.730
Man…

00:57:42.522 --> 00:57:44.483
Serving that son of a bitch
Baek Jeong-tae,

00:57:46.234 --> 00:57:48.862
making sales day and night,
and entertaining clients.

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.741
With that money,
you sent Su-gyeom to college

00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:55.827
and bought a home with Ha-jin.

00:57:59.581 --> 00:58:01.041
You really did your best.

00:58:04.002 --> 00:58:04.878
And…

00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:07.672
I'm sorry.

00:58:22.145 --> 00:58:23.355
I've never…

00:58:25.774 --> 00:58:27.442
given you even a single gift.

00:59:12.195 --> 00:59:13.280
Thanks.

00:59:15.365 --> 00:59:16.700
I feel lighter.

00:59:31.256 --> 00:59:32.591
Go home now.

00:59:34.259 --> 00:59:36.595
You know Ha-jin is waiting up
and worried about you.

00:59:36.678 --> 00:59:37.929
You're right.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.557
She probably called.

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.602
My phone's dead. She's going to be so mad.

00:59:55.739 --> 00:59:56.823
Take good care of yourself.

01:00:00.744 --> 01:00:01.661
Go on.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:07.709
Run!

01:00:12.797 --> 01:00:13.924
Nak-su.

01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:21.264
Be happy.

01:00:25.685 --> 01:00:26.645
Thanks.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.940
Mr. Kim.

01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:33.526
Goodbye.

01:00:34.903 --> 01:00:35.904
Okay.

01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:30.417
I'm so sorry.

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:13.960
All right.

01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:24.220
Good morning.

01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:26.014
-You're up?
-Yes.

01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:28.266
Good morning.

01:02:32.312 --> 01:02:34.314
Dad, can I have one bite?

01:02:35.065 --> 01:02:36.399
Make your own.

01:02:37.359 --> 01:02:38.610
Then I don't want any.

01:02:39.319 --> 01:02:40.737
Fine, here.

01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:42.447
Thank you.

01:02:52.499 --> 01:02:53.416
Who is it?

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.293
Yes, we're here to see the apartment.

01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:59.506
My goodness, I forgot.

01:03:01.257 --> 01:03:03.760
I completely forgot to call.

01:03:03.843 --> 01:03:06.930
But since they came all this way,
I'll just show them around.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:09.849
Come on in.

01:03:11.142 --> 01:03:13.603
-Just one more bite.
-Hold on.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.066
The balcony in these older apartments
isn't completely useless.

01:03:18.149 --> 01:03:21.945
Some people grow
a vegetable garden out here, and--

01:03:22.028 --> 01:03:24.906
It's great for barbecuing
when the weather's nice.

01:03:24.989 --> 01:03:26.783
You can put exercise equipment here too.

01:03:26.866 --> 01:03:29.494
But most importantly,
this place has great energy.

01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:31.746
After I moved here,
I got promoted twice in a row.

01:03:33.623 --> 01:03:36.167
And this woman here
is a real estate agent.

01:03:36.251 --> 01:03:38.586
She passed both parts
of the exam in one go.

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:39.963
I did.

01:03:40.046 --> 01:03:41.381
And… Su-gyeom!

01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:44.634
Come on out for a second.

01:03:45.969 --> 01:03:48.096
This is our son.
Look at the awards behind you.

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:49.472
Over there.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.933
He goes to a university in Sinchon.

01:03:52.016 --> 01:03:53.143
My goodness.

01:03:53.768 --> 01:03:56.187
Your whole family is amazing.

01:03:56.271 --> 01:03:57.647
You can go back now.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:03:58.773
Okay.

01:03:58.857 --> 01:04:01.860
Do you happen to play golf?

01:04:01.943 --> 01:04:03.027
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:04:03.987 --> 01:04:05.697
Then here's the final highlight.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.740
Okay, get ready.

01:04:08.241 --> 01:04:11.286
I got a hole-in-one this spring.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.329
-Really?
-Yes.

01:04:13.413 --> 01:04:16.291
-I've never seen one in person.
-Touch it. It brings good luck.

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:19.210
-Okay. Jin-a, you touch it.
-Right.

01:04:19.294 --> 01:04:21.421
-So you get into that high school.
-All right.

01:04:21.504 --> 01:04:23.548
-Touch it.
-Gosh.

01:04:24.048 --> 01:04:25.675
You'll definitely get in.

01:04:49.115 --> 01:04:49.991
Su-gyeom.

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:57.916
-One point three--
-Hey, no.

01:04:57.999 --> 01:05:00.835
Don't be ridiculous. Put 1.5 million won.

01:05:01.503 --> 01:05:02.629
-Okay.
-It was expensive.

01:05:02.712 --> 01:05:04.005
MEN'S BRIEFCASE AND HIGH-END BELT

01:05:04.088 --> 01:05:05.965
Around 1.5 million. For sale.

01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:08.301
Oh boy.

01:05:11.095 --> 01:05:12.680
The place is so nice, isn't it?

01:05:12.764 --> 01:05:17.143
The balcony is huge,
and the view is amazing!

01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:21.940
The wallpaper is clean enough.

01:05:23.483 --> 01:05:26.528
Wait, you could really
stub your toe on this.

01:05:28.988 --> 01:05:31.491
I guess we can't use
the robot vacuum here, either.

01:05:32.033 --> 01:05:33.535
Is this the master bedroom?

01:05:33.618 --> 01:05:36.329
-I think this is it.
-I'll get you a new one as a gift.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:44.379
The new models have extendable legs
that can get over door thresholds.

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:46.839
-Right.
-There's a lot of cool new stuff.

01:05:46.923 --> 01:05:47.924
Why would you?

01:05:49.842 --> 01:05:50.969
For the tuition.

01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:54.305
You paid for my tuition.
Let's just call it even with this.

01:05:54.389 --> 01:05:57.141
You've been rubbing that in
for so long. I'm fed up.

01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:59.477
Just let me know
if you need anything else.

01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:02.814
Do you want to see the master bedroom?
It's so spacious and nice in there.

01:06:02.897 --> 01:06:04.023
-Have a look.
-Ha-jin.

01:06:05.149 --> 01:06:07.735
Is Nak-su busy these days?

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:12.073
I have something
that I'd like to run by him.

01:06:12.156 --> 01:06:13.533
It's not fintech.

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:15.493
Yes, he is busy.

01:06:15.577 --> 01:06:16.953
He is?

01:06:17.036 --> 01:06:18.246
The master bedroom…

01:06:21.082 --> 01:06:24.252
Don't do something you'll regret.

01:06:25.628 --> 01:06:26.921
Hey, Nak-su.

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.340
Why are you doing this to me now--

01:06:39.726 --> 01:06:41.686
That bastard.

01:06:50.987 --> 01:06:53.406
Hello, Baek Jeong-tae speaking.

01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:57.493
Right now?

01:07:12.383 --> 01:07:13.801
Hello, sir.

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:18.306
Please.

01:07:27.523 --> 01:07:29.859
You're on your way
to see the president, right?

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:11.651
Jin-woo, what took you so long?

01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:12.694
I'm so sorry.

01:08:13.194 --> 01:08:16.155
It's a crucial project,
so I made sure to finish it properly.

01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:17.824
-Over here.
-All right.

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:24.914
We polished it,
changed the brake pads and everything.

01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:27.417
Mr. Shin, you should at least
treat us to a good meal.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.794
-All right.
-Please sell it to someone nice.

01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:31.629
-I will.
-Thank you.

01:08:34.799 --> 01:08:35.675
There we go.

01:08:36.968 --> 01:08:38.136
What the heck?

01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:40.096
-Long time no see, Chang-su.
-Hey!

01:08:40.179 --> 01:08:42.390
-It's been forever.
-I know.

01:08:42.932 --> 01:08:44.016
What's up?

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.185
What do you mean, "what's up"? Just wait.

01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:47.603
You've been well?

01:08:49.772 --> 01:08:51.065
Here we go.

01:08:51.816 --> 01:08:53.192
All right.

01:08:54.152 --> 01:08:55.528
A grand opening gift.

01:08:56.154 --> 01:08:57.238
Jeez.

01:08:59.407 --> 01:09:01.242
-Let's have some tea.
-Sounds good.

01:09:01.325 --> 01:09:03.494
-It's hot. Let's go inside.
-Yes, after you.

01:09:11.919 --> 01:09:14.714
Anyway, Kim Nak-su is something else.

01:09:14.797 --> 01:09:16.424
Okay, done.

01:09:16.507 --> 01:09:18.050
-All done?
-Yes.

01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:27.852
Nice!

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:28.895
Looks great.

01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:40.615
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:43.493
REFRESHING CAR WASH
WE CARE FOR EVERY CAR

01:09:43.576 --> 01:09:45.036
Really, Dad?

01:09:45.119 --> 01:09:46.954
Can I really use that commercial unit?

01:09:47.038 --> 01:09:49.540
I only said okay
because your mom wouldn't stop asking.

01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:50.833
Say "thank you."

01:09:52.502 --> 01:09:55.087
Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:56.130
This…

01:09:58.257 --> 01:10:00.551
The braised kimchi stew
is especially good today.

01:10:00.635 --> 01:10:02.512
-This is absolutely delicious.
-Jeez.

01:10:03.513 --> 01:10:04.847
Man.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.851
I should add some water.

01:10:11.521 --> 01:10:12.605
It's good.

01:10:23.366 --> 01:10:24.367
This is my son.

01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:29.997
They don't look alike.

01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:40.007
-Who is he?
-The psychiatrist on the second floor.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:42.343
He's very handsome.

01:10:51.602 --> 01:10:52.603
We'll be leaving now.

01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:54.981
Thanks for everything. See you later.

01:10:55.064 --> 01:10:55.940
All right.

01:11:01.737 --> 01:11:05.658
ALL-KILL MOVERS

01:11:06.534 --> 01:11:07.910
Should we get going too?

01:11:07.994 --> 01:11:10.079
-Yes, let's take the subway.
-Okay.

01:11:10.162 --> 01:11:11.747
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.793
Should we get jjajangmyeon on the way?

01:11:15.877 --> 01:11:18.004
Jjajangmyeon… I'd like that.

01:11:28.389 --> 01:11:29.515
Dad.

01:11:30.224 --> 01:11:31.100
Yes.

01:11:41.444 --> 01:11:42.778
Honey, come on.

01:12:12.975 --> 01:12:14.226
REFRESHING CAR WASH

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.728
A CLEAN CAR REFLECTS YOUR CHARACTER

01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:17.271
POLISHING, COATING, INTERIOR CLEANING

01:12:33.287 --> 01:12:34.705
Welcome.

01:12:34.789 --> 01:12:37.458
-I heard you do hand washes here.
-Yes. One moment, please.

01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:38.626
Mr. Kim!

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:41.295
-Yes?
-He wants a car wash.

01:12:41.379 --> 01:12:43.965
Okay, just a sec.

01:12:47.468 --> 01:12:48.594
Mr. Kim.

01:12:59.981 --> 01:13:05.027
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:13:35.099 --> 01:13:36.809
Since I'm here anyway,

01:13:36.892 --> 01:13:38.909
I'd be honored to have you wash my car.

01:13:38.978 --> 01:13:40.438
I could really use some good luck.

01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:41.647
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

01:13:42.898 --> 01:13:44.608
-Hello, we're--
-Hello, we're--

01:13:44.692 --> 01:13:47.194
It's a major corporation.
They'll be really picky.

01:13:47.278 --> 01:13:50.865
Do you have any idea what I went through
to make you an executive?

01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:53.993
Well, it's nice to see you
working again after so long.

01:13:54.076 --> 01:13:56.746
Well, this is pretty awkward.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:01.667
I don't know how he found out,
but he definitely knew.

01:14:01.751 --> 01:14:03.961
I don't want to see
Do Jin-woo toying with you.

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:04.920

-Yes.
-Are you ready?

01:14:09.759 --> 01:14:10.843
Don't chicken out.
