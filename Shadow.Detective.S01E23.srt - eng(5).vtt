00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.190
Come on!

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.670
Sister!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.230
-Sister.
-Sister.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.350
Sister.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.350
Are you okay?

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.110
Are you alright, Sister?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.670
Let's go.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.450
I have a younger sister,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.850
who's the same age as you.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520
But I

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.000
don't know where she is.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.900
I miss her very much.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
-Sister.
-Sister.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.629
If you can escape,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.120
go check on her for me.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.820
And tell her...

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.910
-Sister!
-Sister!

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.789
Sister! Are you okay, Sister?

[Episode 23]

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.390
You want to investigate Mr. Jin?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.880
Why investigate him?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.280
We suspect

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.140
he's connected to the past cases.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.710
Impossible.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.590
He's not involved

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.310
in human trafficking or smuggling.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.370
Then why did you arrest him back then?

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.190
I arrested him back then

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.960
because he stole materials
from the Police Department

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.560
and sold them to other gangs.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.150
We caught him red-handed.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.040
Then

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.530
the British took him away.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.800
The next day, they told me

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.100
they would investigate.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.020
They would handle it.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.070
But what did they do?

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.860
They released him the very next day.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.000
I heard that since then,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.600
he disappeared in Shanghai.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.250
Do you know what he did?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.890
What else could he do?

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.180
He continued his shady dealings,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.390
But he kept a much lower profile.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.230
Director Huo,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.560
don't you...

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.200
want to arrest him again?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.600
What's the point of wanting?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.240
I can't even

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.640
keep my own position now.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.320
You can't fight against those in power.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320
Do you know any other news about him?

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.200
He's still in Shanghai,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.950
working for the British.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.400
Wait, why are you asking about him?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.120
How about...

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.680
we catch him for you?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.540
Listen, you young folks,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.589
please stop causing trouble for me.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.690
I already have a British guy

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.630
and Inspector Zhu.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.120
They've given me more than enough trouble.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.560
If you want me to live a few more years,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.040
stop stirring up more trouble for me.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.440
This is what you asked for.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.660
Mr. Peter,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.350
this was custom-made for you.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.950
Not bad, not bad.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.090
Mr. Peter,
pleasure doing business with you.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.950
Peter!

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.670
You guys talk. You guys talk.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.990
Peter.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.520
Let me tell you.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.980
After I lost him,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.630
I immediately returned
to the Intelligence Department

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.360
and had my men search all the alleys

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.510
in that area.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.560
Guess what?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.550
As expected, we didn't find him.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.010
But this trip wasn't completely fruitless.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.550
Do you still remember that clock tower?

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.810
I think there's something wrong with it.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.880
Can you please pay some attention to me?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.800
Whether I pay attention to you or not,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.650
you'll still say it.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.780
Why waste my breath?

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.900
Anyway,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.120
I'm going to investigate that clock tower.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.720
No need.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.930
I'll handle this matter personally.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.659
Did you find it?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.180
After all this time,
you still don't trust me?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.240
Where's the money?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.010
What you're looking for

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
is at the Forensic Institute.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.450
They're working on it

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.600
day and night.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.130
I know what you're looking for.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.280
You killed Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.830
The people from Skylark Company

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.490
won't let you get away with it.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.000
It contains

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.480
the evidence

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.600
of Skylark Company's crimes
from all these years.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.270
If that list is exposed,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.290
many people will be brought down.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.990
Shanghai

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.800
will definitely see a major shake-up.

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:39.320
That's none of your business.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.870
It can be my business.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.630
How so?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.560
That list

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.070
contains something I'm interested in.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.720
That's also why I'm helping you this time.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.580
Go on.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.510
Back then,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.850
Ghost and Butcher

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.220
wanted to steal the list
of all foreign clients

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.370
from Skylark Company,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.430
right?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.560
And then?

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.890
Whoever has that list

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.410
can start their own business.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.560
Since Ghost is dead,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.400
why not let Butcher and I
start our own venture?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.600
With my connections to the British,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.130
we can definitely carve out

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.970
a place for ourselves in Shanghai.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.150
I'll relay your words

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.600
to Butcher.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.510
Then...

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.330
I await your good news.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.200
By the way,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.750
any news

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.030
about her?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.270
It's been so many years.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.470
Why are you still looking for that girl?

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.909
Because this girl

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.530
is a disgrace to me.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.740
She already fell.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.960
She couldn't possibly survive.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.510
But you didn't find her body either,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.670
did you?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.550
I must see her alive or dead.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.470
No matter what.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.560
Who's there?

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.200
Let's go!

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.150
Don't move!

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.790
Who is that girl?

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.120
What do you know?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.580
Who is that woman? Tell me!

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.210
Speak!

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.030
Speak. Don't die.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.240
Who is that woman?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.630
Who is that woman? Speak! Don't die!

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.770
I never expected this.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.550
Mr. Jin, once in all his glory,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.000
would come to such an end.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.750
It's a good thing though.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.210
At least one of my wishes
has been fulfilled.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.720
Look.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.610
After all these years,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.340
he's still doing these things.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.960
Such important documents— how dare he...

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.740
It's not so bad though.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.930
At least my position

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.280
is secure now.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.320
Director Huo.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.000
Inspector Zhu!

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.310
Yizhen, you're here too.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.410
Inspector Zhu.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.320
Why are you in such a good mood

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.150
to visit me?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.730
I just got some fruits,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.000
so I thought of bringing them to you.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.600
You see,

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.830
the weather is so dry.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.080
Eating more fruits is good
for your health.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.570
That's thoughtful of you, Inspector Zhu.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.200
Don't mention it.
It's the least I could do, Director Huo.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.510
We've known each other for so many years.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.570
We're like family.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.400
Yizhen, you try one too.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.480
Thank you.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.210
I'll let you talk. I'm leaving first.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:57.970
You two talk.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.480
Why did he suddenly change his attitude?
Trying to flatter you?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.440
The British are about to fall.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.400
He's lost his backer.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.080
So that means there's no threat
to your position now?

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.550
It's still too early to say that now.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.880
No one can
predict the fate of the British.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.020
So if you want to investigate something,
do it quickly.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.490
What happened? Why the rush to see me?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.630
Mr. Jin is dead.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.390
How did he die?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.530
We were in the middle of our conversation.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.780
The police officers somehow found us.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.570
Mr. Jin, in a panic,

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.030
fell from the clock tower.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.490
It's better that he's dead.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.140
If he had been arrested,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.530
no one would have protected him.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.670
And he might have even betrayed us.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.630
Did you find the thing's whereabouts?

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.480
Yes.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.750
Mr. Jin said

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.960
it's at the Forensic Institute.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.240
The Forensic Institute?

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.430
I know you're upset.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.720
But look.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.810
I haven't given up.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.420
Jingning wouldn't give up either.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.070
How can you give up?

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.010
I admire your courage.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.840
Aren't you worried I've set a trap here

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.900
and lured you here?

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.750
If you were a dog,
I'd be worried you might bite.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.610
But in front of your father,
you weren't even a dog.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.150
Why should I be afraid of you?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.480
Don't be so arrogant!

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.840
Since I called you here,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.370
I have ways to deal with you!

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.800
But I'm not here to settle scores today.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.290
I'm here to discuss a deal with you.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.370
Young Master Zhuo, you want
to discuss a deal with me?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.280
Fine.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.040
Discuss what?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.450
Discuss my father's position.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.770
Do you think
you're qualified to discuss that with me?

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.610
Of course.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.600
Because I'm your only potential partner.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.320
After my father died,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.200
neither you nor Captain
gained the upper hand.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.360
Because the organization
hasn't given either of you

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.480
any instructions.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.560
Even now that Captain is dead,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.170
has anyone from the organization
contacted you?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.260
You seem to know a lot
about how the organization operates.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.080
That's my bargaining chip.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.910
Then tell me

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.470
how to get in touch with the organization.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.490
I think you've misunderstood me.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.970
I mean...

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.090
a collaboration.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.550
Fine.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.520
Tell me how we'll collaborate.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.550
I know

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.470
you've always wanted
to take over Captain's business.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.870
Now that Captain is dead,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.310
I won't compete with you.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.870
From now on, you'll be in charge

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.930
of both smuggled goods

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.020
and human cargo.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.360
And I

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.140
will be responsible
for contacting the organization.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.900
We...

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.640
will be equals.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.700
You sound like a janitor

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.150
rushing into an operating room

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.200
and telling the surgeon

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.200
that he can help perform the surgery.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.230
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.000
My concession
isn't because I'm afraid of you!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.860
It doesn't mean
I don't know how to do your business!

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.690
I just don't want to compete with you.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.080
You know?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.000
Do you know what human cargo is?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.200
Do you know how to receive the goods

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.400
and how to dispose of the useless goods?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.600
Finally, you're here.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.510
I was so scared.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.870
This secret room

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.810
has been locked by us.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.960
Your Tang Jiahao

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.000
won't come to save you.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.080
You're using such dirty tricks.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.750
Are you trying to force me
to collaborate with you?

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.880
Or do you just want to kill me directly?

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.079
He's an old fox.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.900
He won't collaborate with us.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.230
Just kill him directly.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.020
What are you doing?

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.920
Kill him!

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.460
Looks like you set this trap.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.079
Your purpose

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.010
isn't to collaborate with me.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.560
Xiaolin,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.030
what... what did he say?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.750
Tell me,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.480
where is the human cargo?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.730
So that's your purpose.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.320
My hatred for you

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.160
is enough to tear you to pieces

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.280
and chop you into mincemeat.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.000
But today, I just want to know

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.110
where the human cargo is.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.100
Where are those girls?

00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.680
Girls?

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:01.990
What girls?

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.240
What exactly are you doing?

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.030
You deliberately lured him here?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.030
Who are you trying to save?

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.160
That's none of your business! Tell me!

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.830
I don't know.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.720
Tang Jiahao knows.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.590
I don't know either.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.200
Don't come any closer!

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.510
Don't kill me!

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.690
Don't kill...

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.560
What are you going to do?

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.390
What are you laughing at?
Are you that free too?

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.190
Is it cold?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.110
No.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.490
What are you looking at?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.670
Checking if you're frowning
or looking bitter.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.910
Didn't you say we don't have time
to be disappointed?

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.570
Now I'm fully devoted to work.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.480
Inspector!

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.250
Inspector,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.740
there's a homicide case
at Zhuo Chaoxiong's residence.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.150
We have a case. Let's go.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:51.900
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.860
What's the situation at the scene?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.070
After Zhuo Chaoxiong died,

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.470
this residence was sold.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.500
It was discovered
during cleaning this morning.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.580
The blood on the ground
isn't completely dry yet.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.980
That means
the crime happened not long ago.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.880
What's the situation with the victim?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.590
The victim's posture in death
is a bit strange.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.550
And look at this.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.000
she has a dagger wound in her abdomen,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.720
and the dagger is still in the body.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.190
There's so much blood on the ground.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.780
If the blood is all hers,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.070
she clearly died
from excessive blood loss.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.110
Who would endure the severe pain

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.040
and leave the dagger in their body?

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.820
Unless there's a clue on the dagger
she wanted to preserve.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.620
I'll focus on examining the dagger
after I go back.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.510
Looks like she was not the only victim.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.710
There was another person dragged away.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.470
It's Yang Xiaolin.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.620
She was always with Zhuo Feng.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Could the other person be Zhuo Feng?

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.510
There's someone over there!

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.470
Sir.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.960
His tongue was cut out.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.000
His throat and esophagus
were corroded by strong acid.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.240
The bones in his fingers
were completely shattered.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.040
And his wounds have already been infected.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.760
So

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.660
his condition is very critical.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.350
And he can barely communicate.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.210
He may not be able to help you much.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.830
Thank you, doctor.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.680
Zhuo Feng.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.720
Zhuo Feng.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.070
Was it Butcher who did this to you?

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.630
Is Butcher Gu Sinian?

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:07.750
Is...

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.000
Is that right?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.110
Lu Yizhen.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.820
I know you hate him very much.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.350
But there's nothing you can do right now.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.280
But we can.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.200
If we can get information about him,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.460
maybe we can catch him.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.920
Don't you think so?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.030
Take.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.240
Back.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.240
Me?

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.440
Lu Yizhen?

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.480
Th-

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.700
ings.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.640
Take back Lu Yizhen things?

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.180
Take back Lu Yizhen's things.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.830
My things?

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.640
The Forensic Institute might be in danger.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.370
We need to go check it out quickly.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.850
This is just our speculation.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.850
We don't know when they'll come

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.110
or what kind of action

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.000
they'll take.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.730
But judging by Butcher's character,

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.790
once he knows, he'll stop at nothing.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.310
We'd better go check it out.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.840
Let's go.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.670
[Maintain Law and Discipline]

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.780
Don't come out!

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:01.910
It's Tang Jiahao.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.760
Dong.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.610
Go surround them.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.160

Didn't expect it?

Then what's the point
of keeping you police officers?

you always say you don't know.

On the dagger
found in Yang Xiaolin's body,

I discovered someone else's fingerprints.

This person's fingerprints

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.280
also appeared on the weapon
that killed my master.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.890
the person who killed Yang Xiaolin
and Director Wang

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.290
might be the same person?

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.600
Give me the fingerprint information.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.600

the tweezers,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.750
the clamps,

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.480
the pen,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.680
the cup,

and this notebook.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.070
It contains everything he learned
in his lifetime.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.160
He always said

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.640
after he gloriously returned
to his hometown,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.970
he would give this to me.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.240
But who will I learn from now?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.720
What's wrong?

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.030
I think my master had drawn this thing.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.420
This looks like a ticket.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.310
It looks...

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.930
like a shop name.
