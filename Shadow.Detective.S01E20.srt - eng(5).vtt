Mr. Qiang was impressive enough,

Then I won't ask how you learned

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.550
I was looking for this painting.

But as I always say,

caution keeps you safe on a long journey.

To ship this kind of cargo
through my dock,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.480
you need to tell me who sent you.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.840
I understand your caution.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.270
However,

We really can't reveal their identity.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120
But I can tell you two things.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.310
First,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.950
he does have business dealings
with Mr. Qiang.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.480
Second,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.980

their surveillance of this.

At such a sensitive time,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.260

such a public appearance at Shihua Hotel,

Don't you find that strange?

Because the Sasaki we met was fake.

How did you figure that out?

It's all thanks to the dog he kept.

why would a butler

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.360
keep a dog in his master's house?

Why don't you become a storyteller?

I really mean it!

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.990
I figured out that Sasaki was an impostor
because of the dog.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.120
But she noticed it from other details.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.680
In our drinking culture,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.600
there's a hierarchy of respect.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.330
It's the same for the Japanese.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.549
When toasting,

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.080
I noticed the fake Sasaki's cup rim

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.960
was slightly lower than the butler's.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.360
This is a crucial detail.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.390
So that's why you took the initiative
to toast.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.570
Once might be a coincidence,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.940
but three times can't possibly be
mere chance.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.100
I didn't expose him right away

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.030

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.810
Set things up for what?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.020
For shooting at me.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.310
Shooting at you?

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.810
Sasaki asked her to shoot me.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.000
First of all, there were no bullets
in that gun.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.200
Secondly, I didn't shoot at you anyway.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.120
When you picked up that gun,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.850
do you know how terrified I was?

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.020
What were you afraid of?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.120
Were you afraid
I'd sacrifice you or myself?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.630
Seeing your attitude

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.960
when you were about to
investigate Shop No. 7,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.120
I really couldn't tell what you might do.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.790
I'd actually hoped you'd listen to Sasaki

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.870
and point the gun at me.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.470
How could I possibly hurt you?

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.050
But you shouldn't choose to
hurt yourself either.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.180
Anyway, you both came back unscathed.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.580
What about Sasaki now?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.160
I think he's taken the bait.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.400
We can just wait here patiently.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.680
He'll come to us.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.740

It's an honor to meet you.

Mr. Hong,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
although this is our first meeting,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.910
our connections run deep.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.890
Yes, indeed.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.060
I'll leave you to chat.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.970
Please, have a seat.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.840
Miss Lu, you're quite the chameleon.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.710
I almost didn't recognize you
when I came in.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.450
Different occasions call for
different attire.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.910
Miss Lu, thank you for your favor.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.510
Just thanks?
No other show of appreciation?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.130
Miss Lu, you're straightforward.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.200
So

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.620
I agree to cooperate with you.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.470
I'll need to think this over carefully.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.580
Miss Lu,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.450
have you found another collaborator?

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.720
My client has heard

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.320
there were issues
with your antique shipment.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.240
The matter with the antiques
has been resolved.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.720
Please assure him of that.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.080
But that matter

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.680
has already drawn the attention
of the police.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.510
My client had this experience before,

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.770
so he doesn't want to go through it again.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.250
How about this?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.170
Invite him to Shop No. 7,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.030
and I'll explain it to him in person.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.960
Will that work?

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.570
That's a bit difficult.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.810
But since you're sincere,

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.340
I'm willing to give it a try.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.530
Thank you, Miss Lu.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.370
Stop this nonsense!

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.530
Do you call this

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.050
discussing it with me?

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.910
You're just informing me!

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.710
Director Huo.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.790
This is a critical moment.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.270
Your participation

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.040
is the key to our operation's success.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.440
Right.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.640
Since when did you learn to be
so smooth-tongued?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.790
No, Mr. Huo,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.580
my father told me

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.540
you used to be excellent at
performing modern plays.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.840
Why does your father tell you everything?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.000
That was many years ago.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.560
Those best actor awards I won back then—

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.330
better not mention them.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.910
But you went undercover
in the Qinglong Gang

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.310
and solved Shanghai's biggest theft case.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.270
You surely know everything.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.150
I haven't been in the field for years.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.790
I'm rusty!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.000
Director Huo,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.390
Sasaki Jiro is now

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.320
eager to meet the upper echelon
of our organization.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.000
We've looked for many people,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.870
but none fit the role.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.910
Only you,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.430
Director Huo,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.390
are fit to play this role.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.710
We must seize this opportunity

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.960
and make him believe
you're a high-ranking member.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.360
This way, we can not only obtain
the criminal evidence

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.870
but also catch "Butcher."

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.530
Mr. Huo,

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.730
please help us this time.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.150
It's not that I don't want to help you.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.700
Have you considered this—

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.100
what kind of man

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.180
is Sasaki Jiro?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.670
Do you know whether he knows

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.600
I'm the police director?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.960
What if my cover is blown?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.150
Besides, I'm so fat.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.670
What if I get hurt?

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.470
Director Huo.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
You're not fat.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.200
This is the generous build
of a successful man.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.080
You're right about what you just said.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.360
This operation is indeed risky,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.200
but whether to take risks depends on
whether it's worth it.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.440
If it weren't for the fact
that we recently discovered

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.940
such a mysterious organization around us—

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.910
one that may have already infiltrated
every corner,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.910
affecting all of us

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.480
without us even noticing...

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.120
And you...

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.180
will lead us...

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.240
to uproot it completely.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.090
You really need me?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.920
Desperately.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.510
Am I...

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.960
wise and mighty?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.240
You certainly are.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.000
Am I handsome?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.650
I'll think about it.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.780
I couldn't bring myself to answer that.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.200
Mr. Sasaki,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.630
this is Mr. Hu.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.630
Mr. Hu,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.960
this is Mr. Sasaki Jiro.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960
Mr. Hu, I've heard so much about you.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.910
Likewise.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.430
Please.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.870
Mr. Hu.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.200
Miss Lu has mentioned your reputation.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.440
Now that I've met you,

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.440
your reputation is well-deserved.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:58.960
I'm old.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480
In the future,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.500
you'll have to drink this too.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.840
Is this the English style?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.820
Goji berries! Our ancestors' style!

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.870
Mr. Hu,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.560
do you always go out with this many men?

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.310
We learned that from you.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.120
There's an old Chinese saying:

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.790
"Caution keeps you safe
on a long journey."

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.510
I

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.120
always keep that in mind.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.030
Mr. Sasaki, it seems

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.390
you've studied
Chinese proverbs extensively.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.200
But our ancestors' sayings

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.520
definitely contain wisdom!

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.530
Of course.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.910
That's why I'm particularly fond of
Chinese culture.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.790
I can tell.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.550
Mr. Sasaki,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.930
just like these walnuts in my hand,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.120
you like to keep a tight grip

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.150
on everything.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.920
You flatter me, Mr. Hu.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.750
May I ask,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.630
which turf

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.670
did you run before?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.600
Mr. Hu has just returned to the country.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.320
So...

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.750
I'm a wanderer.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.400
I'm at home wherever I go!

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.200
Then the whole world

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.670
is your oyster.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.480
I'm old now.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.630
Mr. Hu,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.320
I didn't agree immediately

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.150
to your previous request.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.200
Please forgive me.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.240
As you know,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.390
things are very tense right now.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.080
So we're very interested in knowing

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.760
why you failed, Mr. Sasaki.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.970
You must mean the antiques.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.580
That was indeed a mistake made by my men.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.200
But rest assured,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.920
the matter has been handled.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.750
It absolutely won't happen again.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.500
You don't have to
explain to me, Mr. Sasaki.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.930
I'm just a businessman.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.510
But whether I should

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.270
let you handle this deal...

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.810
I need to think about it.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:25.760
Mr. Hu.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.770
If you let me take this job,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.670
I guarantee we

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.690
will make a fortune together.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.010
Please.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.110
Then please, Mr. Sasaki,

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.070
show us around your place

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.230
so we can get to know you better.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:56.720
Sure.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.960
Please.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.000
Mr. Hu.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.750
Miss Lu.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.160
Usually, at our dock,

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.860
we ship only ordinary goods.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.060
No one inspects them.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.240
If a client

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.240
needs to transport certain goods,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.900
we hide them in secret compartments
on the ship.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.770
Only the captain knows about them,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.970
and ordinary people can't detect them.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.110
Much better than I imagined.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.950
In all of Shanghai's smuggling business,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.490
there's no one more skilled than me.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.530
I'm not worried about
your professionalism,

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.140
but...

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.730
Mr. Hu,

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.860
if you have any concerns,

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.360
you can ask me directly.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.110
Mr. Sasaki,

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.790
in business, honesty is key.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.790
Mr. Hu doesn't like

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.270
working with people
who go back on their word.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.960
Miss Lu,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.960
I, Sasaki, do business honestly
with everyone,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.270
young and old alike.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.140
You even know Chinese idioms.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.710
You're quite the China expert, Mr. Sasaki.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.110
If you don't want to become Chinese,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.590
then you must want to

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.480
devour all of China.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.880
Mr. Hu,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.590
I wouldn't dare.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.830
If

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.400
you don't trust me,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.790
I can show you all the ledgers

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.170
from our dock.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.440
Would that work?

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.240
My business is extensive.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.310
Contraband, human cargo—

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.110
I deal in all of it.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.840
We only handle contraband.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.550
As for human cargo...

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.070
If you don't know how,
find someone who does.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.590
What?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.850
You can't do it?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.830
I can.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.920
Good.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.480
I like working with people
who have courage.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.280
I always tell her

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.550
that we old folks

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.920
should step aside

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.720
and let the young ones
take over to gain experience.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.450
Let's have a good partnership.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.080
Let's go.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.310
Sasaki, code-named Captain,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.760
is in charge of contraband smuggling.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.410
The Butcher

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.990
handles human cargo.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.550
If we can confirm...

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.050
they've worked together,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.550
then Sasaki must have

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.130
two sets of ledgers.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.290
We've already set the transaction time.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.280
Once the timing is right,
we'll make the arrest

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.520
at the dock.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.750
We just don't know if this fish

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.810
will take the bait.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.920
Catching just one would be good enough.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.160
We can't be too greedy.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.750
Although I have some confidence,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.550
it doesn't mean there's no risk.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.590
So

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.960
once we catch the Captain,

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.370
we'll definitely catch the Butcher.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.470
Sasaki is a cautious man.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.410
If we want to lower the risk,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.540
we need to put pressure on him.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.300
For dealing with this type of person,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.120
I actually have an idea.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.750
Boss!

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.240
Boss!

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.480
There's an article about Mr. Hu

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.940
in today's Shanghai News.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.090
Mr. Hu is actually a British nobleman.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.110
He's planning to move
all his overseas business

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.000
back to China.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.790
Someone went to Shop No. 7, as expected.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.770
Sasaki also sent me a secret message.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.290
What do you need me to do?

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.480
Has your injury healed?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.680
It won't be a problem.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.930
He took the bait.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.920
Tonight, we fish.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.640
Are you all ready?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.360
Finally, we can move.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.880
The big fish has finally taken the bait.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.880
With me on the job,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.480
it's as good as done!

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.560
Stay hidden.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.400
Don't let Sasaki escape from here.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.060
Understood?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.460
Yes.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.800
Mr. Sasaki, what does this mean?

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.400
This is the painting
you gave me last time, Miss Lu.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.240
Now

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.880
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.070
It seems that before I came,

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.130
you two had already exchanged gifts.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.830
But by returning the gift,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.080
are you expressing displeasure with me

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.550
or with her?

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.960
Mr. Hu,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.240
please don't misunderstand.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.510
Last time, Miss Lu gifted me
this painting,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.640
but now that we're working together,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.850
I can't appear ungrateful.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.170
So I'm returning it to you, Miss Lu.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.880
Since we're cooperating,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.830
there's no need to
return the gift, is there?

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.490
Mr. Sasaki, it seems
you have other intentions.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.740
They weren't kidding about
how sharp you are.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.440
Nothing

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.550
can escape your discerning eye.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.070
Mr. Hu,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.520
I'm always cautious in business.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.760
I investigated the previous owner
of this painting.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.470
Guess what I found?

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.870
It seems the situation has changed.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.260
Mr. Sasaki, stop beating around the bush.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.860
Returning the gift

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.510
is an insult in itself.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.520
Since we're suspicious of each other,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.180
let's not cooperate anymore.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.110
I was hoping to try
the food at your Shop No. 7.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.310
Let's go!

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.350
Hold on!

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.160
Since your first visit,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.120
you've been peppering me with questions.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.440
I really want to know:

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.400
if I answer everything correctly,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.510
what will I get?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.510
What more do you want?

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.960
Working with us

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.970
and handling our contraband business—

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.170
isn't that already the biggest benefit
you could ask for?

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.920
Mr. Sasaki.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.240
It's okay for people

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.870
to be greedy.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.270
You want to be the boss,

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.730
right?

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.150
I trust you.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.790
But I don't trust others!

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.270
Mr. Sasaki, if you can pull this off,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.920
Mr. Hu will naturally trust
your abilities.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.030
Then what you want

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.030
will naturally be yours.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.680
Any news from Dong?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.480
No.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:51.960
Take a few men and come with me.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.070
Have the rest stay here.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.590
Yes.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:54.930
You guys,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:55.820
come with me.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.260
Third Brother,

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.840
how did you know
they would ambush us here?

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.310
Send a message to Mr. Sasaki—

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.230
we're under attack.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.640
Yes.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.790
I'm so sorry, you two.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.800
I invited you as guests,

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.480
yet you ended up hearing gunfire here.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.960
I'm really sorry.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.580
I'll send someone

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.670
to check right now.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.160
I'm leaving it to you.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.960
-Stay still!
-Stay still!

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.830
There was gunfire outside just now.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.090
Did something happen?

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.130
Are you okay?

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.280
Thank you, Director Du...

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.400
for saving us.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.650
Don't thank me.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.610
Thank your boss instead.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.650
Inspector Guan?

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.660
Who else would it be?

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.550
I wonder if you

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.950
have taken
what Mr. Hu and I said seriously.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I have.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.400
I have.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120
Mr. Hu and Miss Lu,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.080
look at

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.630
what I've prepared for you.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:04.790
Mr. Hu,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.570
this is the account book from our shop

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.310
I mentioned last time.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.350
What about the other person?

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.410
Why didn't he come?

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.310
Butcher...

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.670
would never come to our Shop No. 7.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.600
Mr. Hu,

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.330
if you want to meet him,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.160
I...

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.280
will take you to him personally.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.340
He sure acts like a big shot.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.770
I've been fed up with his behavior
for a long time.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.880
But our previous boss

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.720
couldn't do anything about him either.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.400
So...

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.600
if you want to meet him...

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.930
it would be better for me
to take you to him myself.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.950
Sure!

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.780
We'll go with you.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:53.570
Please.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.640
Mr. Hu.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.240
I'm a man who follows the rules.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.510
When I say it,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.590
I follow through.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.750
Mr. Sasaki,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.310
why don't you just tell us

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.310
where we need to go

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.310
to meet him?

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.830
Wait.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.490
These accounts don't add up.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.350
You're right.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.080
I never intended to give you the real one.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.120
Are you sure?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.650
Finish them!

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.200
Search more carefully!

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.400
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.310
Mr. Huo.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.720
How is it?

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.310
How many of our men are injured?

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.270
Are they badly wounded?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.160
It's fine. Just a few men
with minor injuries.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.890
Don't worry.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.640
Who the hell

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.480
is behind all of this?
