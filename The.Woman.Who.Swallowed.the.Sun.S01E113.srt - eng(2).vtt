00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.240
This is our Se Ri we're talking about!

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.080
She, of all people, can't act this way!
She's her grandmother!

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.630
But Se Ri...

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.300
isn't Madam Jang's granddaughter.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.870
Her real granddaughter is someone else.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.140
And you have no idea
the two of them were switched.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.210
Knowing the truth,
how would Madam Jang take your side?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.820
You're the only fool
who's still in the dark.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.280
What did I just hear?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.750
The two girls...

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.520
were switched?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.360
(Episode 113)

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.830
Who are you people?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.630
Who sent you?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.070
That's none of your business.
You'd better come with us quietly.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.340
If I come quietly, you'll let me live?

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.600
Well...

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.670
Come with us, and you'll find out.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.340
Did Chairman Min Doo Sik send you?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.850
Is this how you got rid of Jo Pil Doo too?

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.580
You ask too many questions.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.520
What are you waiting for? Get him.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.130
Why you...

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.850
My goodness, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.950
- Where's Se Ri?
- She's not back yet.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.750
She called and said she'll be late.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.220
Why?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.200
What's gotten into you?
What awful thing did you hear this time?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.570
Did that woman give you
a hard time at the company again?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.510
That's not what's important right now.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.050
What? Did something even worse happen?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.920
Lawyer Kim says...

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.350
our Se Ri was switched with someone else.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.160
Manager Gong, what's with that reaction?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.830
Did you know about this?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500
No.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.040
What would I know?
How could someone like me find out?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.770
Is that all Lawyer Kim said?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.380
Did he say who Se Ri was switched with?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.380
Did he happen to mention
who the other girl's mother is?

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.110
No.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.520
Just that Se Ri was switched.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.350
Gosh, that's all?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.190
Then it's nothing. Don't pay it any mind.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.890
He broke off the engagement
to chase after Ms. Soo Jung.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.890
The nerve of him.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.960
He's nothing but an animal.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.130
Why would you listen to a word
that man says?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.270
It's just complete nonsense,
so let it go in one ear and out the other.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.440
He's just trying to get a rise out of you.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.510
It's so obvious what he's doing.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.610
Do you really think so?

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.880
Of course. I'd bet my life on it.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.150
Wait here.
I'll go make you some herbal tea.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.120
It'll help you calm down.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.890
I'll be right back.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.240
Is Se Ri not back yet?

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.850
Look at her, fussing over her own child.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.980
But as long as I'm alive,
she'll never get her hands on Ms. Se Ri.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.550
Just you wait.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.050
She called earlier
to say she was working late.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.370
(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.930
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
Oh, my.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.610
What happened to your face?

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.020
I just had a run-in
with some thugs last night.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.650
Did you report it to the police?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.790
No. It wasn't really
that kind of situation.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.860
What do you mean,
"not that kind of situation?"

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.690
Was it someone you know?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.700
I don't know the guys who jumped me,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.130
but I have a pretty good idea...

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.800
who was behind it.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040
Don't tell me...

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740
it was Chairman Min.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.710
I'm sure my guess is right.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.810
I told you that he's not going to
just stand by and do nothing...

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.010
now that he knows who I am.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.350
He couldn't do anything
because he was unconscious,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.980
but things are different now.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.020
He'll try to get rid of me first
since I'm the biggest thorn in his side.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.260
After everything he did to your parents,
how could he do this again?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.930
You know he's not the type
to feel regret and reflect on himself.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.200
He just piles new sins
on top of his old ones.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.170
That's the only way he knows how to live.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.510
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.640
Don't do this.
Any evidence you get this way...

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.980
won't be admissible in court.
You know that perfectly well.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.920
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.390
Let's find your parents' contract
and take Chairman Min to court...

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.890
as soon as tomorrow.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.490
All right. I know how you feel,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.830
but let's just focus on
what's right in front of us.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.530
I'll be fine.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.920
- Manager Gong. I want a cup too.
- Okay.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.360
Lawyer Kim says...

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.060
our Se Ri was switched with someone else.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.900
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.230
What's on your mind? You're so out of it.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.100
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.070
I can't just stay here.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.240
Ms. Ja Kyung,
I need to step out for a bit.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.080
Where are you going? Come on!

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.850
Look at her, dumping this on me again.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.150
What am I going to do with this?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.380
So, what did you want to talk about?

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.650
As if you don't know.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.060
Why did you have to say something
so reckless to Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.920
She was grilling me
about Ms. Se Ri all night.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.290
She was asking what you meant
when you said Ms. Se Ri was switched.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.900
And she said she heard it from you.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.070
Gosh, when did she hear that?

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.970
You came here just to argue about it?

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.770
Look, to be blunt,
it's not like I made it up.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.640
Don't you know
what Ms. Kyung Chae is going through now?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.070
Why tell her now, of all times?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.740
Even if you and Ms. Kyung Chae are over,
a real man would've taken it to his grave.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.020
Well, lucky Min Kyung Chae,
having such a loyal servant.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.580
Too bad, though.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.790
To you, she might be some revered lady
you're honor-bound to protect,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.260
but not to me.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.160
Min Kyung Chae was the one...

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.030
who threw away
any loyalty or trust between us.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.730
Please, don't be like that.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.830
Lawyer Kim, please go easy
on Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.600
I beg you.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.470
If you could just make sure Ms. Kyung Chae
never finds out about this,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.010
I would be forever in your debt.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.950
Manager Gong? What's she doing here?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.290
And why is she meeting with Lawyer Kim?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.160
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.900
What on earth is going on?

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.340
Come to my office now.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.120
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.250
What was that you said
at the bar last night?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.960
What did I say?

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.560
You said two children
were switched at birth.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.960
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.130
Did you think I was too drunk to hear you?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.970
Did you really say something like that
so casually and hope I wouldn't hear it?

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.770
Who on earth was Se Ri switched with?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.940
Did I say that? I don't seem to recall.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.140
You don't recall?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.010
I must have blacked out.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.350
Anyway, since I don't remember,
I'll be going.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.320
Stop right there!

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.560
I said, stop!

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.590
Kim Sun Jae!
Don't you dare take another step!

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.770
All right, fine.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.940
Let's just say you were too drunk
to remember last night.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.110
Then who were you meeting with just now?

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.180
Don't tell me
you don't remember that either.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.850
Do I have to report everyone I meet
to you now?

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.220
Why did you meet with Manager Gong?

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.590
What could the two of you
possibly have to talk about?

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.260
It's not very ladylike to get physical.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.790
You're a piece of trash.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.560
Even if we're over,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.900
- how could you make that up?
- A piece of trash?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.740
If I'm a piece of trash,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.010
then you, Min Kyung Chae,
are unrecyclable nuclear waste.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.810
Keep this up, and you're going
to get slapped. You hear me?

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.150
If you can't stand by what you said,
take it back now.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.960
And apologize.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.130
For toying with me and my sister, Se Ri,
with that lying tongue of yours.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.200
Your sister?
You're still calling her your sister?

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.200
This is driving me crazy.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.540
You're a lost cause.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.770
Fine. Go on deceiving the world
and everyone around you,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.640
and even yourself.
See how far that gets you.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.530
What brings you home at this hour?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.400
- Where's Se Ri?
- She's at her part-time job.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.270
My goodness. Kyung Chae,
what are you doing here at this hour?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.670
We need to talk.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.140
What's with her?
She ignored me when I asked a question.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.010
But what's she so serious about?

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.680
Kyung Chae looked absolutely livid.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.260
I'm going to ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.830
- What's going on?
- Twenty years ago,

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.130
when I gave birth to Se Ri
at our holiday home in Yangpyeong,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.970
you were the only other person there.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.370
Right?

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.810
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.550
It's not like it was a big hospital
where dozens of babies are born every day.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.110
So there's no way
she could have been switched.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.520
If it had been a private maternity clinic,
I might have had my doubts.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.360
What are they saying?
If they were a bit louder, I could hear.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.430
It's not true, is it?

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.700
It's not, right, Manager Gong?

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.540
Kim Sun Jae is just lying
to mess with me, right?

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.710
You have to say it's not true.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.240
You have to say it's not true!

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.680
Say it's not true.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.680
Say it isn't true!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.620
That's impossible.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.850
Se Ri is my child
whom I carried for ten months.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.890
How could she have been switched?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.560
Why?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.920
Just why?

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.960
What on earth was that?

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.160
How could Se Ri be Kyung Chae's daughter?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.100
The truth is...

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.700
The truth is,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.500
I've been deceiving you all this time,
Ms. Kyung Chae!

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.710
I didn't do it on purpose!

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.110
At the time, I believed
it was for your own good.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.110
And I still believe that to this day.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.690
After I found out what happened,
I didn't want to go on living.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.260
For 20 years,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.660
I've lived with this buried inside me.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960
Do you think it was easy for me?

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.460
It's like my whole world
came crashing down.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.340
What on earth are you trying to tell me?

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.810
That day,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.980
right after you gave birth and passed out,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.880
your baby had cyanosis...

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.920
and was struggling to breathe.
I wrapped her up...

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.550
and rushed to the hospital.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.020
It was in the wee hours of the morning.
There wasn't a single car on the road.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.690
I was going out of my mind.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.300
But just then,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.770
an ambulance drove by.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.870
I forced the ambulance to stop
and hitched a ride.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.540
Inside was another baby...

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.080
and her mother.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880
Stop it.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680
I don't want to hear it.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.120
You have to listen!
You need to know the truth now!

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.790
There was a car accident
near the hospital,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.660
and when the paramedic got out
to deal with the accident,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.130
your baby...

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.970
stopped breathing!

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.640
My mind just went blank.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.240
If you found out
something had happened to the baby,

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.580
I was sure
you wouldn't have made it either.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.550
But...

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.020
just then,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.290
that little girl caught my eye.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.390
Shut your mouth!
Or I'll rip that mouth off your face!

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.930
Nothing happened 20 years ago.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.830
So until you're six feet under,

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.470
you'll keep your mouth shut
and live a quiet life!

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.740
Ms. Kyung Chae...

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.620
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.890
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.500
No matter what anyone says,
Se Ri is my daughter.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.230
Switched at birth? Don't be ridiculous.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.600
She's my spitting image in every way.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.940
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.240
You know he's not the type
to feel regret and reflect on himself.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.510
He just piles new sins
on top of his old ones.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.350
That's the only way he knows how to live.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.380
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960
How did it go?

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.460
I told you to report to me immediately.
Why are you only calling now?

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.390
What?

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.530
You useless fools.
You're a waste of space.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.770
Just wait a few days and hit him again
when his guard is down.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.800
Useless fools.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.010
They can't do one thing right.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.880
I saw Director Moon Tae Kyung
at the company today,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.510
and his face was a mess.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.550
Really? How bad did that jerk look?

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.250
Did you do something to Director Moon?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.190
You don't know what a depraved jerk he is.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.030
He's the one who came after me
to get revenge for his father.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.330
But even so,

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.870
do you really have to
go that far with Director Moon?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.470
Of course I do.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.110
I wouldn't be Min Doo Sik
if I couldn't take care of Moon Tae Kyung.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120
What's going on?

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.790
By the way, you're not actually dating
Sun Jae, are you?

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.690
You two are just doing this
to get under Kyung Chae's skin, right?

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.300
Is that really what's important right now?

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.730
Of course it's important.
This family is about to implode.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.740
Our family has been a mess for ages.
This is nothing new.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.140
More importantly, we have to see Dad.
It was one thing not knowing where he was,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.740
but now that we know,
we can't just pretend we don't.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
You've got a point.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.350
- When should we go?
- We need to see him...

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.820
before the shareholders' meeting
to pick a side.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.390
"We?" I mean, in this situation,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.790
do we really need to be lumped together
as "we?"

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.960
Why?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.760
Because Kyung Chae
will take my position and give it to you,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.830
you don't want to be on my team anymore?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.630
It's not that. Kyung Chae promised me
the director position,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.240
so it makes sense to team up with her,
not you.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.770
Hilarious.
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.980
That only works if Kyung Chae ousts Lucia
and becomes chairman herself.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.940
Barring any major surprises,
won't that happen?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.910
A major surprise has already happened.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.250
- What surprise?
- I told you, Dad woke up.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.420
You think Dad will just let Kyung Chae
kick out the love of his life, Lucia?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.690
He was powerless when he was unconscious,
but things are different now.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.460
The shareholders' meeting
will be pointless if Dad stops it.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.630
Darn, now that you mention it,
you're right.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.300
There's no way Father would allow
a meeting...

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.670
- to kick that woman out.
- Gosh, are you just figuring that out?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.710
Do I have to spell everything out for you?

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.580
Se Ri. Perfect timing.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.420
You won't believe what I heard today.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.250
Whatever it is, save it for later.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.290
No, wait! It's a secret about one's birth.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.790
Like in a drama?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.360
Why? Was I switched at birth?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.600
No way. How did you know?

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.100
Seriously,
you must be psychic or something.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.510
Whatever. I just got back from work,
and I'm tired.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.240
Let's talk later.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.340
Wait... Gosh.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.210
What was that?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.110
She should set up a shop
as a fortune teller.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.650
At this rate,
she'll be channeling spirits.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.150
Gosh! What's going on?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.790
What are you doing in here?

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.830
Manager Gong, are you crying?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.930
No, I'm fine.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.970
You're obviously crying.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.270
What happened?
Did someone say something to you?

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.640
Even if they did, so what?
You've got way more seniority than that.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.280
Why are you hiding in my room crying?
You should've just fought back.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.810
Come on, what's really going on?

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.320
Who did this to you, Manager Gong?

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.620
I don't know who it is,
but I won't let them get away with it.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.820
You can count on me, Manager Gong.
I'm 100 percent on your side.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.170
Gosh, I tell you not to cry,
and you just cry harder.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.150
Stop peeking into his room like that.
You'll give people the wrong idea.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.520
It looks like
he's not coming home tonight.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.050
This has never happened with Tae Kyung.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.890
He's probably working late.
He's no slacker like you, Yang Mal Sook.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920
If he's late, it's overtime.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.960
If he stays out,
he's pulling an all-nighter.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.190
If there's a thud,
that means something fell.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.760
If you hear a toot, someone farted.
It's not rocket science.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.630
You'd know that if you ever had to work.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.700
But he always calls when he's late
because he knows we'll worry.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.810
Someone like him didn't say a word.
That's why I'm concerned.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.210
Sometimes things just happen.
What's the big deal?

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.180
No, I have a bad feeling about this.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.580
What if on his way home,

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.180
he ran into some thugs
and got beaten to a pulp?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.350
That's the most ridiculous thing I heard.
Don't you know how tough he is?

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.690
He's more likely to be dishing it out
than taking it.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.690
Anyway,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.060
the more I think about it,
Tae Kyung has a lot of secrets.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.960
What? Another crazy soap opera plot?
A secret about one's birth?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.700
Think about it. When he first moved in,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.770
he never mentioned
he worked for Mingang Distribution.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.040
Now that you mention it,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.070
he did hide the fact that he was
in the same department as Ji Seop.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.410
That's what I'm saying.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.410
There's definitely something more to it.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.480
If it's not a secret about his birth,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.680
it's a secret revenge plot.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.750
Or a secret about his birth
and a secret revenge plot.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.960
Right! He moved in here for revenge.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.490
That's why he joined Mingang too.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.290
He moved into our house for revenge?

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.300
Oh, he's the long-lost son
of Yang Mal Sook.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.130
And the young lady of the Mingang family
is his secret lover.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.530
He moved in here to destroy me...

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.340
and joined Mingang
to destroy our in-laws...

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.640
- to become Korea's biggest tycoon!
- This is so much fun!

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.540
Should I become a writer?
Oh Pan Sool, the master of melodrama.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.510
I could get 100 episodes out of this.
No, I could get 200!

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.910
- I just love these crazy dramas!
- Of course you do. You've lived one.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.320
Gosh, you!

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.950
Are you sure you heard that right, honey?

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.790
A secret about Se Ri's birth, so suddenly?

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.590
I wish I had misheard.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.360
I'm serious. I've been on edge all day.
I couldn't focus on my chores.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.800
But you don't do chores anyway.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:20.100
Anyway, the point is that Se Ri
is Kyung Chae's secret daughter,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.340
and on top of that,
Se Ri was switched at birth.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.970
Does that even make sense?

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.340
As far as I know,
Kyung Chae has never even dated.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.180
And how would you know
if Kyung Chae was seeing someone?

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.350
I have a sixth sense for things like that.
I can tell just by looking.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.190
Oh, please. "I can tell by looking?"

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.520
Your intuition's awful. You have no idea.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.090
I'm telling you,
I'm like a psychic when it comes to that.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.260
I knew you were single before we met.
I pegged that right away.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.230
See? This is why your intuition's garbage.
What made you think I wasn't with someone?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.270
I was juggling a different guy
for every day of the week...

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400
What are you talking about?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.440
Honey. You had other men than me?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
Tell me!

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.450
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.520
What are you still doing out here
at this hour?

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.050
I just have a lot on my mind.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.160
Are you afraid to go home?

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.530
Or are you trying to avoid seeing Se Ri?

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.330
If you're this torn up,
you might as well get a DNA test.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.430
A DNA test?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.370
It'll be easier for you
to get some closure that way.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.340
What kind of closure?

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.710
If the results don't match,
do I just say, "You're not my daughter?"

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.910
"It was fun while it lasted.
See you. Bye."

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.920
Is that what you want me to do?

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.920
And what's next?

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.790
Go on a quest to find my "real" daughter?

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.290
It's better to just rip the band-aid off
than to keep suffering like this.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.930
Let's be honest.
You're stuck in limbo right now.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.460
What do you mean, I'm stuck?

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.430
You can't fully accept her,
but you can't fully reject her either.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.170
What would you know about it?

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.500
Are you trying to lecture me?

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.040
Se Ri is obviously my daughter.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.310
We're alike in every single way.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.210
Fine. Keep telling yourself that
if it makes you feel better.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.280
But remember there's a truth
you still don't know.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.490
When you find the courage
to face that truth, let me know.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.720
And I will gladly open
Pandora's box for you.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.460
(Mingang Distribution)

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.480
Gosh, that's spicy.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.820
It's so spicy.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.490
It's so spicy.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.260
What are you eating at this hour?

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.960
It's a late-night snack. I skipped dinner.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.130
Why didn't you ask Manager Gong
to make you something?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.270
Manager Gong wasn't feeling well today,
so I told her to get some rest.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.840
What about you?
Do you want some if you haven't eaten?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.340
I'm not hungry.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.290
If you were going to eat,
you should've had a proper meal.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.960
What is this stuff?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.730
It's fine. I can't eat this anyway.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:35.970
Or this!

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.870
What is this?
This is all stuff that you like.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.900
It makes sense, though.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.170
Manager Gong plans the menu around you
so she can feed you.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.710
It's all stuff I can't have.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.950
Come to think of it,
we're not alike at all. Not in any way.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.750
Especially our taste in food.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.220
What do you mean we're not alike?

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.390
People say we're spitting images,
that we could be mother and daughter.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.930
Who? Unless we say we're sisters,
people think we're complete strangers.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.530
Who? Who said we look like strangers?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.700
How could you and I ever be strangers?

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.330
Kyung Chae...

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.800
Eat them. These are all my favorite foods.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.710
So naturally, you have to like them too.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.680
How can you not even stand to eat them?

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.750
Kyung Chae, what's wrong?
You know I'm allergic to this.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.350
Well, I'm not! So eat it!

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.950
Kyung Chae!

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.990
You're a carbon copy of me.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.730
It's impossible that we're not alike.
How could we not be?

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.400
See? Mothers and daughters
are supposed to be alike!

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.300
Eat this too.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.240
What do you think you're doing?

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.730
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.650
What's wrong with Kyung Chae?
She's acting like she's lost her mind.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.980
So what happens
when Pandora's box is opened?

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.950
Is there a more terrifying truth
hidden inside?

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.720
I thought I told you to ask
when you're sure you can handle it.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.920
If it succeeds, it's a revolution.
If it fails, it's a coup.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.390
And you failed.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.430
I'm sorry for sharing this now,
but you're my daughter.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.490
You're my mom?

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.860
