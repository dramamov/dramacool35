00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:15.717
Are you not going
to treat my mother, Physician Chu?

00:02:16.957 --> 00:02:18.515
Feng Zhilou seems

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.236
to quite like you.

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:23.277
Xiaoyu,

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:27.236
you should be my most loyal dog.

00:02:29.997 --> 00:02:31.197
Take your shoes off.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.396
I'll be waiting in the bedchamber.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:29.635
Xiaoyu, I'll help you

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.916
no matter what you want to do.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.477
Just like how you helped me.

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:49.716
You always carry the fragrance
of various herbs

00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:51.236
from the apothecary.

00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:54.396
It's a soothing scent.

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:02.755
Xiaoyu,

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.595
life will be very hard
in the days to come.

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:05.956
Maybe even miserable.

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:06.997
But

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:08.195
you must also remember.

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.515
You are a physician.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.355
You can cure others,

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.877
and you can cure yourself too.

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:29.236
Do you really think

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:32.516
I'd forgive a dog that betrayed me?

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:34.155
How dare a mute like you

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:37.275
desire what doesn't belong to you!

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:40.237
You'd plot with Feng Zhilou
behind my back.

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:42.797
No wonder people say

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:44.797
that barking dogs

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.237
seldom bite.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.796
(Apothecary)

00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:09.596
What is it?

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:11.317
For some odd reason,

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:13.917
I've been feeling uneasy

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:16.677
since last night.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.835
Xiaoyu was summoned to Longevity Hall.

00:05:18.836 --> 00:05:20.636
Why hasn't she returned yet?

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.757
Why don't we talk to Li Yan

00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:27.357
so that Chu Xiaoyu is no longer responsible
for treating Li Yue's blood poisoning?

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:29.996
Not only that,

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.396
but Li Yue's illness is also incurable
in the first place.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:36.396
Oh?

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:37.796
Have you not learned from last time?

00:05:37.797 --> 00:05:39.117
You've misunderstood.

00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:41.557
We'd never attack a bride
of the Dragons,

00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:43.836
the wife of Prince Shang.

00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.197
However,

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:46.635
Her Grace just took care

00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:48.476
of a dog.

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:52.437
Please come to collect the corpse.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.440
(Apothecary)

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:08.476
You're here.

00:06:08.597 --> 00:06:09.797
Come in.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.197
Take your trash away too.

00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:15.357
How filthy.

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:16.997
She's an eyesore.

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.076
Xiaoyu.

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:29.997
Xiaoyu, wake up.

00:06:30.997 --> 00:06:32.036
Wake up.

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.716
Are you mad?

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.076
No way.

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.315
Do you want to kill me

00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:51.677
to avenge that mute?

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:53.997
What to do?

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:56.476
I'm the princess of Wujing

00:06:56.477 --> 00:06:58.596
and of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:06:58.597 --> 00:07:00.437
Dare you kill me?

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:26.956
Xiaoyu,

00:07:28.877 --> 00:07:29.836
I'm sorry.

00:07:30.677 --> 00:07:32.076
I was late.

00:07:32.677 --> 00:07:34.516
I failed to protect you.

00:07:35.797 --> 00:07:36.956
To the outside world,

00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:40.716
I'm the fearless Feng Zhilou.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:44.437
But in Xiaoyu's eyes,

00:07:46.677 --> 00:07:47.876
I'm the friend

00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:49.516
she needed to take care of.

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:52.197
I'm sorry.

00:08:00.597 --> 00:08:01.836
What happened?

00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:04.236
Princess Liluo,

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:05.356
your dear sister,

00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:06.716
sure is a kind woman.

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.755
She took advantage of the mute

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.437
and illiterate physician serving her

00:08:10.477 --> 00:08:11.955
who's unable to spill her secrets,

00:08:11.956 --> 00:08:13.317
ordering her around.

00:08:13.557 --> 00:08:14.835
She even went as far

00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:16.797
as to kill Chu Xiaoyu to make a point.

00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:20.917
Xiaoyu?

00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:22.797
Where is Xiaoyu?

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:23.916
Zhilou,

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:24.955
was he telling the truth?

00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:25.715
Come here!

00:08:25.716 --> 00:08:27.677
Check out what your sister did!

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:32.237
Xiaoyu.

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:34.557
Xiaoyu.

00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:40.157
Wujing is full of treachery.

00:08:41.117 --> 00:08:43.677
Only you treat everyone with sincerity.

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:46.356
You just arrived into my life.

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:48.917
How could you be gone just like that?

00:08:57.317 --> 00:08:58.437
Young Lord,

00:08:58.597 --> 00:09:00.277
no need to put on an act.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:02.557
Do you really care for Xiaoyu?

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:05.116
Are you really upset over her?

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:07.996
All you care about
is why Xiaoyu hasn't gone

00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:10.197
to treat your eyes today.

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.157
Leave now.

00:09:21.717 --> 00:09:23.157
Congratulations, your grace.

00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:26.917
Prince Rong sent a message
on the sanctuary's behalf.

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:28.356
In three days,

00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:30.635
Prince Shang of the sanctuary

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:33.395
will deliver the Wujing Saintess' robe

00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:34.675
and hold the ceremony

00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:36.716
to welcome you to the sanctuary.

00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.637
Feng Zhiluo isn't dead yet.

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:42.756
How am I meant to rest easy?

00:09:42.877 --> 00:09:44.596
Do you want Prince Shang to marry me

00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:46.037
with her still on his mind?

00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:47.996
Furthermore, we both know

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:49.836
about the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:09:51.477 --> 00:09:53.795
The sanctuary fully believes
in the results

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:55.596
of the ceremony.

00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:57.317
Everything is ready.

00:09:57.636 --> 00:09:58.756
Now is the time

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:02.076
to root out the problem.

00:10:04.117 --> 00:10:05.236
Darn it.

00:10:05.556 --> 00:10:07.076
Prince Shang is always

00:10:07.077 --> 00:10:08.476
hanging around Feng Zhilou.

00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:09.635
How am I meant to do it?

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:10.596
Liluo!

00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:12.797
Young Lord.

00:10:14.877 --> 00:10:16.476
Why did you kill Chu Xiaoyu?

00:10:18.877 --> 00:10:20.316
You make a scene

00:10:20.317 --> 00:10:23.236
and question me merely
over her death.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.076
Just how cruel are you?

00:10:26.117 --> 00:10:28.716
You speak of taking lives with ease

00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:30.356
like they're worth nothing!

00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:32.317
How noble you are.

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:33.876
How graceful.

00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:35.397
Li Yan,

00:10:35.796 --> 00:10:37.557
you call me cruel,

00:10:37.997 --> 00:10:40.035
but when you and Feng Zhilou
steal Yue away,

00:10:40.036 --> 00:10:42.275
you will not only get Mother
and me killed,

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:44.996
you will have also
killed the innocent civilians of Wujing.

00:10:44.997 --> 00:10:46.236
Which of us is more cruel?

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:48.557
What do you mean by that?

00:10:51.997 --> 00:10:53.116
Do you know that in order

00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:55.437
to restore your eyesight,

00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:57.277
Mother took full responsibility

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:00.116
so that you won't feel guilty

00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:02.356
and can become the noble gentleman

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:03.555
everyone speaks of?

00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:06.756
You're now
the esteemed young lord of Wujing,

00:11:07.357 --> 00:11:09.517
yet what did you do in return?

00:11:09.676 --> 00:11:11.076
You wish to destroy my future

00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:13.157
and everything we've done.

00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:15.797
Mother and I are like this now

00:11:15.877 --> 00:11:17.035
all because of karma.

00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:18.637
Of course, there's a price to pay.

00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:21.437
But the true price is

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:24.116
the status as Wujing City Lord

00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:25.756
and the Dragon Queen!

00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:32.996
My dear

00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:34.635
and beloved brother.

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:36.756
You're actually crazy

00:11:37.276 --> 00:11:38.635
and bloodthirsty monsters.

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:40.397
How are you any different
from the Demons?

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:42.596
And you still think

00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:44.197
you can marry into the Dragons.

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:47.317
Every day, Xiaoyu had
to witness your filthy deeds

00:11:47.597 --> 00:11:49.557
yet can't speak of them.

00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:51.037
She had no one to confide in

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:53.236
and nowhere to plead for justice.

00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:56.356
Oh, how much Xiaoyu suffered.

00:11:58.036 --> 00:11:59.476
My dear brother,

00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:02.917
you're a kid still
living the dream Mother created.

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:04.316
You forever fantasize

00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:06.316
that the world is fair

00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:07.677
and beautiful.

00:12:08.756 --> 00:12:10.437
You should be glad

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:13.037
that you're under my control now.

00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:16.157
If we weren't blood related,

00:12:16.276 --> 00:12:18.517
I wouldn't bother to keep you alive.

00:12:18.756 --> 00:12:19.677
Get lost!

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:24.677
I don't have a sister like you.

00:13:10.597 --> 00:13:11.797
Xiaoyu,

00:13:12.877 --> 00:13:14.437
they say that in Wujing,

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:15.956
the souls of dead children

00:13:16.477 --> 00:13:18.596
transform into fireflies.

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:21.956
With them by your side,

00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.756
you won't be lonely.

00:14:06.837 --> 00:14:08.037
Thinking of Xiaoyu?

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.596
I'm reminded of how I was always bullied

00:14:12.197 --> 00:14:13.876
in Feng Manor.

00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:18.476
But I had my father,
secretly protecting me.

00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:21.956
Uncle Qingyun silently supported me.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.557
What about Xiaoyu?

00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:26.596
The physicians of the apothecary,

00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:29.116
Li Yue,

00:14:30.156 --> 00:14:31.317
Liluo,

00:14:32.197 --> 00:14:34.517
and the so-called nobles of Wujing

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:37.236
all abused and humiliated her.

00:14:37.957 --> 00:14:39.996
She was already battered all over,

00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:44.037
yet she was kind enough to heal them

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.317
and try her best to live on.

00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:49.356
She was just a simple girl,

00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:53.637
yet there was nowhere to shelter her.

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:00.037
Zhilou,

00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:03.076
these are all meant
to help you grow stronger,

00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:05.157
to find more like Chu Xiaoyu

00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:07.157
and have them come to you.

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:08.677
You'll protect them,

00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:11.236
save them from future abuse,

00:15:11.796 --> 00:15:13.797
and create a bigger home for them.

00:15:14.197 --> 00:15:15.277
As for me,

00:15:16.197 --> 00:15:17.876
I'll always be with you.

00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:22.716
Nie Rongzhi has

00:15:22.717 --> 00:15:24.356
come all the way here from the sanctuary

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.557
and declared I must continue
to marry Liluo.

00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:29.517
I have to settle this matter.

00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:31.637
There's no need

00:15:31.837 --> 00:15:33.277
for explanations between us.

00:15:33.916 --> 00:15:36.076
I'll always wait here for you.

00:15:37.317 --> 00:15:39.277
Keep yourself safe here.

00:15:39.957 --> 00:15:41.076
Wait for my return.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.116
Prince Shang,

00:16:15.156 --> 00:16:16.557
you're here.

00:16:16.957 --> 00:16:18.716
Do you regret it?

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:21.996
Tonight is a gorgeous evening.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.996
Doesn't it make me look even prettier?

00:16:26.317 --> 00:16:27.677
Tell me.

00:16:27.957 --> 00:16:31.116
Am I a hundred times more beautiful

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.996
than Feng Manor's bumpkin?

00:16:38.837 --> 00:16:40.917
You are the Wujing Saintess,

00:16:48.477 --> 00:16:50.157
yet your dress

00:16:50.436 --> 00:16:52.677
is too plain and bland.

00:16:53.636 --> 00:16:55.236
It's like you're mourning.

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:58.116
The great Wujing Saintess

00:16:58.837 --> 00:17:01.116
should be dressed in bold colors

00:17:01.276 --> 00:17:03.596
to compliment your bold ambitions.

00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:06.356
You've delivered the message
on the sanctuary's behalf,

00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:07.836
so leave already.

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:12.637
What is it?

00:17:13.236 --> 00:17:15.437
Can I not make a detour

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:18.316
to admire the Wujing Saintess?

00:17:22.357 --> 00:17:23.556
I think

00:17:24.156 --> 00:17:26.917
that even if it's to be the Dragon King,

00:17:28.117 --> 00:17:30.556
you don't actually want
to win my favor.

00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:36.117
You should know

00:17:36.236 --> 00:17:37.956
that the princes of the sanctuary

00:17:38.117 --> 00:17:40.756
still have the right
to choose our own wives,

00:17:41.557 --> 00:17:43.516
even if we don't

00:17:44.236 --> 00:17:46.117
marry the Wujing Saintess,

00:17:46.916 --> 00:17:49.516
no one can threaten our authority.

00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:51.837
Are you mocking me?

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:55.077
That's just a fact.

00:17:56.956 --> 00:17:58.556
Without the Dragon King's Decree,

00:17:58.797 --> 00:18:00.276
you are just

00:18:00.277 --> 00:18:02.397
a human princess.

00:18:04.636 --> 00:18:05.996
But everyone wants

00:18:06.277 --> 00:18:08.397
to be the Dragon King and Queen.

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:14.637
Alright.

00:18:15.196 --> 00:18:17.796
I'm going to kill Feng Zhilou anyway

00:18:17.916 --> 00:18:20.276
while you want to take
Prince Shang's place.

00:18:20.797 --> 00:18:23.837
Keep Chu Moshang away from Feng Zhilou,

00:18:24.196 --> 00:18:26.316
and I'll consider your suggestion.

00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:28.116
Finally, you have

00:18:28.117 --> 00:18:29.837
proposed a good idea.

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:31.796
I merely think that the true victors

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:34.675
are those who can fight to the end.

00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:36.556
The process doesn't matter,

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:40.716
but I must be the Dragon Queen.

00:18:46.196 --> 00:18:49.076
Father, please retract the decree
arranging the marriage with Wujing.

00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:50.356
You don't want to watch

00:18:50.357 --> 00:18:52.397
as I refuse to marry in public, right?

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:56.276
Father,

00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:58.756
I've delivered your decree to Wujing.

00:18:58.757 --> 00:19:01.637
We only await the delivery
of the Wujing Saintess' battle robe.

00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:03.476
Nie Rongzhi,

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:05.197
there's no need

00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:06.956
for you to worry about my affairs.

00:19:07.317 --> 00:19:09.996
