00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.235
(Lee Je Hoon)

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:23.265
(Jang Hyuk Jin, Bae Yoo Ram, Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin)

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.315
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:38.514
(This drama is a work of fiction)

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:39.945
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:41.054
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:42.115
(Children and animals were filmed under guidelines.)

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.155
Driver Kim Do Gi.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:49.295
- How's the new used car? - I think I might've paid too much.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.055
Driver Kim Do Gi.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:17.725
I think I paid more for this car than I expected.

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.035
Driver Kim, is something wrong?

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:50.655
(Safety First)

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:56.725
Hey, there's a crash!

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:58.665
- Call someone! - Quick, call 911.

00:01:58.725 --> 00:01:59.794
How do I...

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:01.695
- Someone call 911, quick! - Are you okay?

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.505
Driver Kim Do Gi, can you hear me?

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:10.405
Go Eun.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:16.415
I think I'm going to need a tow.

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.915
- The airbag didn't go off? - There's someone inside.

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:25.285
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.455
All right. Just keep coming straight back.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:29.525
(Episode 4)

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.365
- Yes, just pull straight in. - Let's get to work.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:36.165
Right. Come straight in.

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:43.875
All right.

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:47.545
Next one.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.615
Move back, I'm spraying it down.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:50.715
Further back.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:58.525
Driver Kim Do Gi.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:00.495
This car's been flooded.

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:04.164
- A flooded car? - Level three flooded car...

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:05.665
with its engine submerged.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:10.265
With a level three, it can stall suddenly on a highway...

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.665
or fail and cause a major accident, just like this one.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:14.805
This car should never have been put on the market.

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:17.005
It's basically a ticking time bomb on wheels.

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:22.415
Not just the kids. Countless people on the street could've been hurt.

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:26.415
So how can you tell if a car has been flooded?

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:29.285
There are a few ways to check if a car's been flooded.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:35.925
When you pull the seatbelt all the way out,

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:38.095
if there are traces of muddy water, that's a red flag.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.735
- It's clean. - Replace all four belts.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:41.965
- With used ones. - Got it.

00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:43.435
Hey, Choi.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:45.905
But what if they replaced the belts?

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:48.635
You can check for that too.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:52.275
Just check inside the cover. They usually don't clean in there.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:59.985
- Clean the crevices with a swab. - Park, get the swabs.

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:02.315
- Yes, sir. - What if they cleaned that too?

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:04.325
There's still a way to tell.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:09.555
You can check for mud inside the rubber weather stripping.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:11.865
- No mud here. - Replace all the weatherstripping.

00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:13.465
And what if they replaced those with new ones?

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:17.105
You can check the model sticker or the condition of the fuses.

00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:20.204
- Did you change this? - I haven't touched it.

00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:21.905
Replace these two cars' fuse boxes over here.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:27.915
Get started.

00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:33.445
All right, be thorough. Check that too, okay?

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:34.485
Got it.

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:35.515
Found it.

00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:37.225
It's got to be here.

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:44.325
There's a mud stain here.

00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:46.565
Gosh, we missed that.

00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:49.595
If they'll go to these lengths to hide that a car was flooded,

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:51.905
then they're the real problem, not the car.

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:55.805
I still don't get it. All this trouble for a flooded car?

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:57.445
Because if they can trick someone into buying just one,

00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.205
they stand to make a huge profit.

00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:03.275
Money's important, but come on. People could die in an accident.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:07.315
Anyone selling these flooded cars should be rounded up and drowned.

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:10.785
Legally, a car this flood-damaged should've been scrapped.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.885
But for it to be sitting brazenly on a lot...

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:17.095
means an illicit pipeline must exist for acquiring these cars.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:19.694
I'll start by checking the transported vehicles...

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:21.035
that went to and from Noblesse.

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:22.995
Here, get rid of this.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:26.805
- It's from a flooded car. - You're right.

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:36.275
Goodness.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:38.345
Thanks.

00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.955
I heard you haven't been home in days.

00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:43.555
I sent a text.

00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:46.425
I told them I needed to get some air for a few days.

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.755
Your wife and Ji Eun are really worried.

00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:52.395
It's just that I...

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.895
don't have the confidence to face my family yet.

00:05:57.135 --> 00:06:00.535
There you go again, saying the opposite of how you feel.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.745
You mean you can't wait to see them, right?

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:07.515
You're right.

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:11.345
My wife and Ji Eun...

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:13.985
I miss them so much.

00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:19.555
Just hang in there a little longer. We'll take care of everything.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.925
I never imagined you'd do this kind of work, Mr. Jang.

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:28.165
And to think we've worked together for over ten years.

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:31.235
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:34.605
I'm sure you had your reasons. You don't have to apologize.

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:37.505
I'm the one who should be sorry...

00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:39.045
and grateful.

00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:40.975
Oh, right.

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:42.875
Here.

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:46.985
That imported car registered in your name, Driver Oh.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.215
I've transferred the ownership to my name.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:50.955
What are you talking about?

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.225
Why would you do that?

00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:57.625
Hey, is there some rule that says I can't drive a fancy car?

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:05.565
I've got it all handled, so please don't worry about it.

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:16.744
Remember when some guy threw a fit...

00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:17.844
about his license getting revoked?

00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:19.385
How much did the boss pay for it?

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.815
The boss probably bought it for 1,000 dollars.

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:23.215
It was 1,000 dollars?

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:25.284
But we sold it for 100,000 dollars.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:26.355
That's right.

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.795
He made 100 times his money.

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:32.095
Our boss is seriously the best.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:35.535
Hey, work hard. Then maybe one day you can be like the boss.

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:38.105
Driver Kim Do Gi, did you hear that?

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:41.335
They made 100 times their money off of Driver Oh.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:44.375
Then we'll take it back from them, 100-fold.

00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:49.615
I've called everywhere,

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.985
and it looks like there's nothing worth getting...

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:54.255
for individual taxi licenses today.

00:07:55.285 --> 00:07:57.785
- What about the online forums? - I haven't checked them yet.

00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:01.295
You should set up keyword alerts so you see them right away.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:02.924
- Okay. - But you should go on...

00:08:02.925 --> 00:08:04.295
a business trip first.

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.695
A business trip? Where to?

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:11.634
The torrential downpour last weekend has left four dead...

00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.865
and displaced 8,000 residents.

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:15.934
Police are continuing to search...

00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:17.035
for the two people who are still missing...

00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:20.045
To the place that was flooded, where people died?

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:22.975
Is that all your darn eyes can see?

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:26.545
You'll never make any real money.

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:29.185
What do you mean, sir?

00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:33.185
- I saw seven cars just at a glance. - Seven cars?

00:08:34.295 --> 00:08:37.055
- Gosh. - Call for a car carrier.

00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:39.725
- Yes, sir. - That's seven, all right.

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:42.095
Let's go get those cars washed.

00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:46.635
Keep it coming.

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:50.635
This batch is really nice.

00:08:52.075 --> 00:08:55.045
We've got German cars, American cars,

00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:56.875
and even a British car.

00:08:56.945 --> 00:08:59.815
This is a pretty good haul. What more could you ask for?

00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:01.815
- Go check them out. - Thank you.

00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:07.555
We only see each other when there's a flood.

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:11.395
Then again, meeting up for work is what we enjoy.

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:15.265
- How many did you bring in total? - Gosh, so impatient.

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:18.835
After your call, Mr. Cha, I found some without full coverage.

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:21.635
I've secured seven of them in total. Here, take a look.

00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:25.975
You've rounded up a nice little collection.

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:31.145
So that's how they've been getting these flooded cars.

00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:34.155
By buying back the cars that come into the scrapyard?

00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:38.855
Flooded cars are usually written off by insurance and then scrapped.

00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:42.925
But they're after flooded cars without comprehensive coverage.

00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:46.295
That's why the flood history check came up clean.

00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:49.935
With no insurance, there's no reason to report the flood damage.

00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:51.865
Then the people who buy the cars from the dealership...

00:09:51.935 --> 00:09:54.275
would have absolutely no idea what they're buying, right?

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:56.635
They'll only find out...

00:09:58.375 --> 00:09:59.745
after the car dies on them.

00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:03.015
Now, you need to pay me.

00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.455
If we're done here, let's go.

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:21.364
(Scrapped vehicles must be deregistered.)

00:10:21.365 --> 00:10:22.934
(File with your city or county office.)

00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:24.565
(We can handle the deregistration for you.)

00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:32.545
(Scrapyard Office)

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:35.775
Come on, TG. What's wrong with you?

00:10:56.195 --> 00:10:57.235
Who's there?

00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:09.775
Hey, I want some of that jerky too.

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:12.515
Come on out. Stop hiding.

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:21.395
Hey.

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.225
Who are you?

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:27.125
You used the car scrapping papers to transfer the ownership.

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:29.335
I said, who are you?

00:11:30.135 --> 00:11:31.165
What are you talking about?

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:03.935
Let's wash them up and send them off to a good home.

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:06.265
They just have to run smoothly for one month, that's all.

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:07.735
Yes, sir.

00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:11.875
That car on the far left is a popular family model.

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:14.715
So pay extra attention. The passenger-side airbag deployed.

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:16.075
Tuck it back inside...

00:12:16.345 --> 00:12:18.785
- and stitch it up, Manager Yoo. - The airbag?

00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:20.485
Make it a nice, clean stitch.

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:24.225
But if I do that, the airbag won't deploy in a crash.

00:12:25.755 --> 00:12:26.785
Are you going to be driving it?

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:29.695
- No. - Then why do you care?

00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:34.265
Then I'll stitch it up nicely.

00:12:34.365 --> 00:12:36.235
- Hey. - Yes?

00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:38.165
Wipe that smile off your face.

00:12:39.405 --> 00:12:41.275
Sir.

00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:43.535
Sir.

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:47.775
It's about these documents...

00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:50.915
I couldn't process the titles, so I decided to look into it.

00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:53.045
It turns out all the cars we bought from the scrapyard yesterday...

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:54.555
have already been deregistered.

00:12:55.785 --> 00:12:57.015
Are you sure you checked properly?

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:00.525
I checked every single VIN myself.

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:07.865
(Cheongju Scumbag)

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:15.505
That jerk.

00:13:16.405 --> 00:13:19.275
You live in the gutter, you become gutter trash.

00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:21.775
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:26.085
(8pm, Legal consultation for the goons)

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:36.295
Finish prepping the cars and just leave them be.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:38.725
We're turning them all into ghost cars.

00:13:39.225 --> 00:13:40.365
Yes, sir.

00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:53.775
Okay. Just say you don't remember. Period.

00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:55.874
Byeong Jin, thanks a lot.

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.285
Remember that girl I told you about?

00:13:58.415 --> 00:14:00.415
She's pressing rape charges.

00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:02.815
You need to be more careful, you idiot.

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:05.584
Byeong Jin, my buddy was out for a joyride...

00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:07.555
with his girlfriend,

00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:08.825
and he ended up hitting someone.

00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:12.025
- Was he playing Grand Theft Auto? - What did you say? You jerk.

00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:20.235
Yes.

00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:22.205
How's the victim?

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:23.675
The victim?

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.745
Dead or alive?

00:14:26.205 --> 00:14:27.275
They're alive.

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.515
Okay, so they're alive.

00:14:30.175 --> 00:14:31.185
Alcohol?

00:14:31.545 --> 00:14:33.785
- Alcohol? - Were you drunk?

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:36.455
A little. Two bottles of whisky.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.025
Two bottles of whisky?

00:14:38.485 --> 00:14:41.095
Hey, two bottles aren't "a little."

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:44.195
Don't get out of the car. Go to the nearest convenience store.

00:14:44.255 --> 00:14:45.894
Go buy a bottle of soju...

00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:47.695
and drink it where you can be seen clearly on security cameras.

00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:50.735
- That'll get you out of the DUI. - You're telling him to drink more?

00:14:51.805 --> 00:14:53.965
Five minutes later, report the accident to insurance.

00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:56.975
If they sue, just write a very sincere apology.

00:14:57.575 --> 00:14:59.045
Got it. Thank you, sir.

00:15:00.645 --> 00:15:02.845
How on earth do you know all this stuff?

00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:04.815
Hey! That stupid jerk.

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:07.385
Byeong Jin is a lawyer.

00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:09.785
Former lawyer.

00:15:14.555 --> 00:15:15.595
All right!

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:17.495
Let's settle this month's rent!

00:15:17.555 --> 00:15:18.865
- You got it! - Right away!

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:20.795
It's 50,000 dollars.

00:15:21.365 --> 00:15:24.765
- Gosh, hurry up. - Hurry.

00:15:31.775 --> 00:15:33.575
That place looks super expensive.

00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:37.115
I bet they're eating expensive food in there. Those jerks.

00:15:38.315 --> 00:15:39.385
I know, right?

00:15:39.785 --> 00:15:43.385
Why do bad guys always pick places with no security cameras?

00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:49.825
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:51.465
I'm going in.

00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:53.925
- So that's what you meant. - See you later.

00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:57.335
I need to cover my face.

00:16:03.035 --> 00:16:05.575
- You do have a plan, right? - No, not really.

00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:08.115
- Then why'd you come in? - I had a hunch there was something.

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:10.415
- A hunch about what? - I don't know. You got any ideas?

00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:13.885
- No! I was following you. - Hey, you little...

00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:16.285
You should've said we shouldn't go, you brat!

00:16:16.355 --> 00:16:17.455
Hey, what did I do?

00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:19.755
Show some respect! Aren't you going to let go?

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:23.455
- No! You let go first! - I'm going to count to three. One.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.365
Two. Two and a half, two and three quarters!

00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:30.165
Three! Hey! I said three, so why didn't you let go?

00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:32.035
What's wrong with you? I said three, you punk!

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:35.135
This isn't my first rodeo. I knew you'd try something.

00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:37.575
- What? Why, you little... - Who are you guys?

00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:44.815
Sorry. We seem to have picked the wrong room to fight in.

00:16:45.345 --> 00:16:48.885
We'll just go fight somewhere else. Please enjoy your evening.

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:51.655
Get out! You little brat!

00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:53.785
Those idiots.

00:16:56.295 --> 00:16:57.595
Hey, drink up!

00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:00.565
- Drink up! - Drink up!

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:08.635
We did good, right?

00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:10.275
Go Eun, are you getting a clear view?

00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:13.975
Well, I can just barely see.

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:16.275
Anybody need a ghost car these days?

00:17:16.615 --> 00:17:18.545
I do. I need about three.

00:17:19.145 --> 00:17:20.145
Three?

00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:22.055
I can get you those three.

00:17:22.515 --> 00:17:24.285
Byeong Jin, we need some too!

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:27.155
Just let me know if you need any.

00:17:27.925 --> 00:17:29.325
I can set you all up.

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:34.295
Hey, we're all in a good mood, so let's get a group picture.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:35.535
Take it!

00:17:35.995 --> 00:17:38.835
He's really putting cars on the road that have no business being there.

00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:42.435
That guy only cares about money. He has no regard for human life.

00:17:42.805 --> 00:17:44.505
Look at what he did to Driver Oh.

00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:48.415
He didn't just fake his license. He also sold him a luxury car...

00:17:48.475 --> 00:17:49.715
just to bleed him dry.

00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:53.285
I guess it's time to act like we've got money to burn.

00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:58.885
We have a wide selection of cars. We've got this one, and that one...

00:18:00.785 --> 00:18:03.195
- Manager Yoo, show him around. - Right this way, sir.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:11.665
Hey, fashionista!

00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:15.035
Hello.

00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:20.175
Looks like you're here to exchange the car you bought last time.

00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:24.345
You must not have read the contract very carefully, my friend.

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:27.215
I'm not here to exchange the car.

00:18:27.745 --> 00:18:28.755
Then what?

00:18:30.385 --> 00:18:32.555
- You want a refund? - No.

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:35.155
I'm here to buy a car.

00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:39.795
You see, I...

00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:42.695
just got a new girlfriend,

00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:44.865
and as a surprise,

00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:47.365
I want to get her a used car as a gift.

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:52.675
Gosh, would you look at that.

00:18:54.245 --> 00:18:56.375
You're a real romantic, aren't you?

00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:02.455
- Without love, I - Can't go on

00:19:03.255 --> 00:19:07.055
Man, there's no better surprise than a car, am I right?

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:11.825
You know it. Okay, recommend a good one for me.

00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:13.025
Just for you,

00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:17.635
I'll recommend a real killer.

00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:19.405
All right, this one here. The red one.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.135
It's sharp.

00:19:21.605 --> 00:19:25.375
- It's a sweet ride. - Oh, a killer car! I love it.

00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:26.475
Wait, you shouldn't...

00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:33.645
- What a pushover. - Gosh, those are expensive.

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:39.255
This one's a goner too.

00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:40.855
It's gone.

00:19:41.225 --> 00:19:42.955
Another level-three flooded car.

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.865
He said he'd sell me a "killer" car,

00:19:47.425 --> 00:19:48.665
and I guess he wasn't lying.

00:19:50.195 --> 00:19:52.165
What do you think they're thinking about me?

00:19:52.435 --> 00:19:55.104
You're buying what they're selling.

00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:56.275
They must think you're a pushover.

00:19:57.735 --> 00:19:59.105
Guess I'll have to buy another one, then.

00:19:59.445 --> 00:20:02.345
They'll be happy to see you again, Driver Kim Do Gi.

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:05.545
No.

00:20:07.645 --> 00:20:08.915
I'm going to buy one somewhere else.

00:20:09.615 --> 00:20:10.615
What?

00:20:19.395 --> 00:20:21.895
Honey, this car has really low mileage.

00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:24.635
And the price is pretty good. Should we get this one?

00:20:24.705 --> 00:20:26.235
That's because it's been in a ton of accidents.

00:20:26.735 --> 00:20:28.105
If you look closely here,

00:20:28.405 --> 00:20:29.835
the bumper is a slightly different color.

00:20:31.005 --> 00:20:33.705
They just have a lot of cars. Honestly, most of them are no good.

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.975
How about I recommend a great car from our dealership?

00:20:36.045 --> 00:20:37.045
Excuse me.

00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:39.345
What do you think you're doing in front of our lot?

00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:41.555
They just had some questions.

00:20:42.555 --> 00:20:44.585
Darn, I almost poached one.

00:20:46.885 --> 00:20:48.625
This one just came in yesterday, fresh on the lot.

00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:53.125
- Look at the curves on this thing. - Isn't that the pushover?

00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:56.465
Love that soars so high

00:20:58.065 --> 00:21:01.575
All right then. I really like this one.

00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:05.945
Just recommend a good one for me.

00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:12.815
What is with that guy?

00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:15.615
He bought another used car?

00:21:16.215 --> 00:21:18.525
Come on. Are you sure you saw that right?

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:22.395
I'm sure it was that pushover. It was a gift for his girlfriend.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.465
But he just bought a car from us not too long ago.

00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:26.825
Doesn't that seem a little strange?

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:28.165
Now that you mention it.

00:21:28.595 --> 00:21:30.465
That guy's buying cars too often, don't you think?

00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:33.065
Something is definitely off.

00:21:34.975 --> 00:21:36.805
He's a repeat buyer. Good for us. What's so strange?

00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:39.045
It's not like he's in a car carrier buying them up.

00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:40.775
Don't make a big deal out of nothing.

00:21:42.245 --> 00:21:43.245
Go Eun.

00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:46.145
Get a car carrier ready for me.

00:21:55.455 --> 00:21:57.255
Yes, sir. Of course. Thank you.

00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:14.945
Let's do this.

00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:19.885
A car carrier?

00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:22.555
Boss!

00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:25.125
That pushover is driving a car carrier buying up used cars.

00:22:26.255 --> 00:22:27.485
He loaded them onto a car carrier?

00:22:27.685 --> 00:22:30.725
Yes. The other used cars he bought from other lots were on there too.

00:22:32.965 --> 00:22:35.265
The more I think about that pushover,

00:22:35.635 --> 00:22:37.595
the more things don't add up.

00:22:37.935 --> 00:22:41.265
He never even bothered to check the cars' condition.

00:22:41.435 --> 00:22:42.605
And he never tried to haggle.

00:22:47.345 --> 00:22:48.975
That pushover's here.

00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:51.415
To buy a car.

00:22:52.085 --> 00:22:53.085
Why?

00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:55.385
Again?

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:02.995
What's wrong?

00:23:06.825 --> 00:23:08.595
My girlfriend and I broke up.

00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:11.965
You broke up with your girlfriend,

00:23:12.735 --> 00:23:14.505
so you came to buy a used car?

00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:20.275
I feel like a drive in a new car...

00:23:21.545 --> 00:23:23.275
will cheer me up.

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:29.755
Got any recommendations?

00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:32.525
This one... Gosh.

00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:36.725
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:38.725
Could you help me pick this up?

00:23:49.275 --> 00:23:50.735
(This certifies the transfer of ownership.)

00:23:50.835 --> 00:23:51.845
(Kim Do Gi)

00:23:53.275 --> 00:23:54.275
We're all set, right?

00:23:54.915 --> 00:23:56.145
Hold on a sec.

00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:02.115
Right, thanks. Go ahead, count it.

00:24:05.155 --> 00:24:08.595
We're pretty much done, but...

00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:18.835
You haven't paid the residual value of 7,000 dollars.

00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:23.275
- Residual value? - That needs to be paid in cash.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:26.505
If not, we can just cancel the whole deal.

00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:35.855
That's right. Right, the residual value.

00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:38.285
That's right. It totally slipped my mind.

00:24:38.725 --> 00:24:42.625
Okay, then. Is a check okay?

00:24:45.925 --> 00:24:46.925
Count it.

00:24:48.065 --> 00:24:50.695
And don't worry, the serial numbers are all unique.

00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:54.105
Thank you. Have a good one.

00:24:54.635 --> 00:24:55.705
Take care.

00:24:57.175 --> 00:24:58.345
Right. One more thing.

00:24:58.945 --> 00:24:59.945
The car key.

00:25:01.845 --> 00:25:04.415
This is mine now. Have a good one.

00:25:06.745 --> 00:25:08.244
It's my car!

00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:10.015
But that pushover...

00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:12.555
I bet he doesn't even know what residual value is.

00:25:13.455 --> 00:25:16.495
Look at him. He doesn't give a darn about price.

00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:18.695
- What on earth is that? - Thank you!

00:25:21.695 --> 00:25:22.695
Get the car key.

00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:53.925
Where on earth is he going?

00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:24.555
All right.

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:44.515
Let's get a little closer.

00:26:44.975 --> 00:26:45.985
Okay.

00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:01.095
Perfect.

00:27:06.265 --> 00:27:09.775
All mine!

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:13.645
There he is.

00:27:14.905 --> 00:27:15.915
What is that thing?

00:27:25.255 --> 00:27:27.324
Please enter the four-digit code.

00:27:27.325 --> 00:27:29.725
Five, two, eight, three. There we go.

00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:39.265
- Thank you. Thank you very much. - What is that?

00:27:46.645 --> 00:27:48.745
- Isn't that money? - This is it.

00:27:49.415 --> 00:27:51.715
Bye. I'll be back for more.

00:27:52.685 --> 00:27:53.685
Hide.

00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:57.085
(Exit)

00:27:58.985 --> 00:28:00.855
Time to score another one.

00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:06.865
He's got skills.

00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:33.025
He goes to used car lots and buys cars.

00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:35.695
It looks like he's hoarding them all here.

00:28:35.825 --> 00:28:38.395
The cars he bought from us are over there too.

00:28:38.595 --> 00:28:40.365
- Where? - Right there.

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:43.795
Oh, I see.

00:28:45.165 --> 00:28:47.805
Okay, let's see.

00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:51.535
Used cars, a car carrier, and...

00:28:52.975 --> 00:28:53.975
love?

00:28:54.975 --> 00:28:59.145
Gosh, I can't figure out what this jerk is up to.

00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:01.215
Maybe he's collecting used cars to export them?

00:29:01.285 --> 00:29:05.355
Come on. What moron buys cars at a dealer to export for a loss?

00:29:05.685 --> 00:29:06.685
What if...

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:10.725
he's buying all these cars to smuggle drugs?

00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:13.695
The curiosity is killing me.

00:29:13.765 --> 00:29:16.235
What is this pushover's deal, anyway?

00:29:16.395 --> 00:29:19.165
What? People?

00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:28.005
Well, well. Look at those curious eyes.

00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:30.375
The fact they followed me here so quickly...

00:29:31.145 --> 00:29:32.685
means they must be dying to know why.

00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:35.754
- It's not just them. I'm curious. - Me too.

00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:37.215
You can at least tell us, can't you?

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:40.355
I may've built it, but I don't know. What does that thing even do?

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:44.195
- You curious? - Yes.

00:29:44.255 --> 00:29:45.265
Desperately.

00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:48.325
To sell the cars.

00:29:48.735 --> 00:29:50.195
- What? - What?

00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:53.335
Did you get what Driver Kim Do Gi just said?

00:29:53.505 --> 00:29:56.474
- No. Should I smack him and ask? - What?

00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:57.935
Who's smacking who?

00:29:58.405 --> 00:29:59.845
Driver Kim Do Gi. He's going to hit me.

00:30:00.145 --> 00:30:01.675
Then maybe he'll feel sorry for me and talk, right?

00:30:01.975 --> 00:30:04.115
That could work. Go take one for the team.

00:30:05.745 --> 00:30:06.785
Goodness.

00:30:12.085 --> 00:30:14.085
Please enter your four-digit code.

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.795
Please try again.

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.335
Please try again.

00:30:32.175 --> 00:30:33.205
If you don't know the code, move on.

00:30:37.045 --> 00:30:38.645
Stop hitting it and move on.

00:31:04.105 --> 00:31:06.075
The next time that pushover comes to buy a car,

00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:08.575
we need to have a little chat with him.

00:31:09.145 --> 00:31:10.145
Yes, sir.

00:31:10.845 --> 00:31:11.845
Darn it.

00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:16.685
(Pedestrian Entrance)

00:31:16.755 --> 00:31:17.815
Hello.

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:26.695
He's in a real hurry. He really missed you, Driver Kim.

00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:29.165
Yes, maybe he missed me so much that he got angry.

00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:34.265
I feel like they're not just going to sell me a car today.

00:31:35.135 --> 00:31:37.075
Doesn't that make things a little dangerous?

00:31:37.635 --> 00:31:39.605
I just have to buy from them one last time.

00:31:39.945 --> 00:31:40.945
It'll be fine.

00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:46.885
Good news, everyone!

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:51.615
What do you know? I've gotten myself a new girlfriend!

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:56.395
Recommend me one with a really smooth ride.

00:31:56.655 --> 00:31:59.625
You want a smooth ride? I'll find you the perfect one.

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:16.915
How about that? A killer ride, right?

00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:25.825
- Let me take a look. - No, you can't.

00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:27.555
You're a cheeky one.

00:32:28.185 --> 00:32:31.355
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:32:31.395 --> 00:32:32.395
A misunderstanding?

00:32:32.396 --> 00:32:35.495
Yes. I haven't done anything wrong.

00:32:35.565 --> 00:32:38.865
- You think you've done no wrong? - What? What did I do?

00:32:39.065 --> 00:32:40.505
Your problem is...

00:32:41.965 --> 00:32:45.075
that you're just so unfriendly, you punk.

00:32:45.575 --> 00:32:47.705
- I am? - Yes.

00:32:47.845 --> 00:32:49.745
What? That can't be right.

00:32:56.385 --> 00:32:57.885
This feels ominous.

00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:10.465
Wait, are you going to hit me?

00:33:12.605 --> 00:33:15.065
You don't have to hit me. I'll tell you everything.

00:33:15.735 --> 00:33:17.705
Just ask me anything!

00:33:31.555 --> 00:33:32.925
Why are you buying up all these used cars?

00:33:39.695 --> 00:33:40.695
I'll only ask you one more time.

00:33:41.065 --> 00:33:44.365
Oh, no. You don't have to ask again.

00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:47.665
I...

00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:50.475
I managed to land a real pushover.

00:33:51.535 --> 00:33:55.815
- A pushover? - Yes. If I buy a used car,

00:33:56.115 --> 00:33:58.475
he adds ten percent on top of the purchase price...

00:33:59.085 --> 00:34:00.515
and gives it to me as a finder's fee.

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:02.315
Ten percent?

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:03.915
Yes.

00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:07.655
So that's why you didn't care about the prices and kept buying.

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:09.925
Since I get reimbursed for all of it.

00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:13.765
What's he planning on doing with all those cars?

00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:16.835
That part, I'm not sure about.

00:34:17.865 --> 00:34:19.165
Is he exporting them or something?

00:34:19.505 --> 00:34:20.605
Maybe that's it?

00:34:21.265 --> 00:34:23.275
I have no idea.

00:34:25.805 --> 00:34:28.245
I really don't know!

00:34:28.405 --> 00:34:30.975
He probably found his own pushover to sell to.

00:34:31.075 --> 00:34:32.615
Sir, you should take a look at this contract.

00:34:33.345 --> 00:34:34.885
That's...

00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:37.255
He signed a contract for 100 cars.

00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:40.625
Darn. I've only managed to get 30 so far.

00:34:41.025 --> 00:34:43.395
I need to get to 100 fast.

00:34:44.095 --> 00:34:47.995
If you need that many, why buy them one by one instead of all at once?

00:34:48.365 --> 00:34:50.565
Because that would look suspicious, wouldn't it?

00:34:52.365 --> 00:34:55.335
Driving around in a car carrier to buy them 1 by 1 isn't suspicious?

00:34:57.135 --> 00:34:58.675
I hadn't thought of that.

00:34:59.975 --> 00:35:01.105
So you're still 70 cars short.

00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:05.885
You want to go home, don't you?

00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:07.145
Excuse me?

00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:09.215
Yes.

00:35:10.785 --> 00:35:11.985
Then you're going to do a little job with me.

00:35:20.665 --> 00:35:21.695
Okay.

00:35:24.365 --> 00:35:25.365
All right.

00:35:26.405 --> 00:35:29.135
Could you loosen these? They're too tight.

00:35:29.435 --> 00:35:30.435
It hurts.

00:35:31.005 --> 00:35:34.205
But if we get involved with that guy,

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:37.175
are you sure we won't get into trouble?

00:35:37.575 --> 00:35:38.775
All we have to do is sell the cars.

00:35:39.685 --> 00:35:42.215
Even if something goes wrong, that pushover's on the contract,

00:35:42.285 --> 00:35:43.315
so we have nothing to worry about.

00:35:45.285 --> 00:35:49.425
We have a total of 36 cars available to take immediately.

00:35:50.095 --> 00:35:51.555
Thirty-six?

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:54.225
Should I get the contracts ready for all of them?

00:35:57.665 --> 00:36:01.135
Thirty-six cars. Plus the thirty that pushover took.

00:36:03.675 --> 00:36:05.435
That means we still have room for 34 more.

00:36:06.345 --> 00:36:07.645
Are you going to buy them from other dealerships?

00:36:19.255 --> 00:36:20.255
That's harsh.

00:36:21.255 --> 00:36:23.095
I know. After you cooperated so nicely,

00:36:23.155 --> 00:36:26.325
they won't even untie you. They're real jerks.

00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.565
How many cars did you say they have in stock?

00:36:31.065 --> 00:36:32.065
Thirty-six.

00:36:32.435 --> 00:36:35.265
Then it's about time we get ready to sell too.

00:36:35.635 --> 00:36:38.135
Okay. I'm all set with the contracts too.

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:40.245
I'm done too.

00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:49.115
Post it now.

00:36:51.555 --> 00:36:54.955
The taxi company near my house.

00:36:55.155 --> 00:36:57.625
I'm spilling the tea on their massive flood.

00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:22.555
Hey!

00:37:25.485 --> 00:37:26.855
Hey!

00:37:45.475 --> 00:37:46.475
Whoosh!

00:37:53.885 --> 00:37:55.115
(Post)

00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:56.455
(New post with keyword detected)

00:37:56.515 --> 00:37:58.185
(Keywords: Flood, submerged)

00:37:58.285 --> 00:38:01.155
A pipe burst at the taxi company across from my house. It's a flood.

00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:03.525
It's total pandemonium. And it was my day to sleep in,

00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:05.224
but I kept hearing noise,

00:38:05.225 --> 00:38:06.925
so I looked out my window and was shocked.

00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:08.894
All the cars are underwater.

00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:10.995
The taxi company is gone. It's submerged.

00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:15.535
So now we just have to wait around until that guy takes the bait?

00:38:15.975 --> 00:38:17.605
I'm not a big fan of waiting.

00:38:17.935 --> 00:38:20.174
- Brings back some bad memories. - It does.

00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:21.205
(Can you tell me the location of the taxi company?)

00:38:21.245 --> 00:38:22.975
Looks like we won't have to wait at all.

00:38:23.045 --> 00:38:24.515
(I'd like to help out personally.)

00:38:24.575 --> 00:38:27.785
Driver Kim, they're asking for our location. What should I tell them?

00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:33.985
Could you pass on a message to Mr. Jang for me?

00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:37.995
Tell him it's a good day for a drink.

00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:08.955
My gosh.

00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:19.335
(Business suspended)

00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:27.575
Gosh, look at all this.

00:39:30.215 --> 00:39:32.275
Money, money

00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:52.035
This is perfect. A level-three flood car.

00:39:56.575 --> 00:39:57.575
Who's there?

00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:05.415
We're not even open. Why are you here?

00:40:08.285 --> 00:40:09.285
Are you a burglar?

00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:14.585
Just when I was feeling lonely and desolate,

00:40:14.925 --> 00:40:16.155
I'm even happy to see a burglar.

00:40:16.555 --> 00:40:17.955
Come on in.

00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:21.825
- Are you the owner? - The owner?

00:40:25.365 --> 00:40:28.605
The owner of a ruined company? I'm hardly that.

00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:32.035
How about a drink with me?

00:40:37.175 --> 00:40:38.175
Wait.

00:40:39.385 --> 00:40:43.115
Are you saying that you want to buy...

00:40:44.185 --> 00:40:45.985
all of our flooded taxis?

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:48.625
After all,

00:40:49.725 --> 00:40:52.525
if you scrap those cars, you'll only get 900 dollars per car,

00:40:53.195 --> 00:40:55.625
for a total of just 27,000 dollars, right?

00:40:56.335 --> 00:40:57.365
But from there,

00:40:58.395 --> 00:41:01.035
once you factor in towing, paperwork, and deregistration fees,

00:41:01.765 --> 00:41:03.435
the money you'll actually pocket will be next to nothing.

00:41:04.835 --> 00:41:07.405
You're not wrong, but...

00:41:10.775 --> 00:41:14.545
How about this? I'll even cover all incidental fees,

00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:17.615
and I'll pay you 1,200 dollars for each car.

00:41:22.185 --> 00:41:23.195
What do you say?

00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:26.725
In that case...

00:41:27.795 --> 00:41:30.634
Let's draw up a contract first.

00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:31.865
The contract... Wait a second.

00:41:31.935 --> 00:41:33.665
- The contract form... - I'll pay you on the spot.

00:41:39.075 --> 00:41:41.205
I need the cars as soon as possible.

00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:50.755
Thank you.

00:41:51.955 --> 00:41:54.655
All right, keep coming. Yes, you're good.

00:41:54.725 --> 00:41:56.455
Okay, stop!

00:41:57.925 --> 00:41:59.395
All right, you're good.

00:42:02.525 --> 00:42:03.935
The contract's signed, so get them moving now.

00:42:03.995 --> 00:42:08.105
Got it. We'll be busting our butts back and forth all night.

00:42:08.505 --> 00:42:09.805
Hold on!

00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:11.105
What?

00:42:11.775 --> 00:42:13.505
Hold on a second.

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:17.875
When will you pay the other 500,000 dollars...

00:42:18.215 --> 00:42:19.315
for the residual value?

00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:24.615
I prefer cash, by the way.

00:42:28.285 --> 00:42:30.655
What's this nonsense? That's not in the contract.

00:42:30.895 --> 00:42:32.695
It's not in your copy of the contract?

00:42:33.965 --> 00:42:35.565
Because it's right here in mine.

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:40.605
If you slip this special provision right in here,

00:42:41.605 --> 00:42:44.175
your seal is stamped plain as day right here.

00:42:47.745 --> 00:42:49.245
If you were going to argue against it,

00:42:49.675 --> 00:42:51.075
you should've used an inter-page seal.

00:42:53.215 --> 00:42:55.385
I guess going bankrupt made you lose your mind.

00:42:58.355 --> 00:42:59.385
Choi!

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:06.825
You have a Choi. We have a Kim.

00:43:07.525 --> 00:43:08.665
Kim.

00:43:15.265 --> 00:43:16.675
Isn't that the pushover?

00:43:17.075 --> 00:43:18.405
Why is that pushover coming out of there?

00:43:18.975 --> 00:43:20.375
What's going on?

00:43:23.215 --> 00:43:24.245
I think we're done for.

00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:36.125
Is everyone okay?

00:43:38.855 --> 00:43:39.865
You want to go home, don't you?

00:43:40.695 --> 00:43:41.895
Then you're going to do a little job with me.

00:43:43.165 --> 00:43:44.135
Okay.

00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:49.935
So, were you planning to scam me from the start?

00:43:50.775 --> 00:43:52.605
Gosh, that's a bit harsh.

00:43:53.075 --> 00:43:55.105
Especially after I sold so many used cars for you.

00:43:56.115 --> 00:43:59.515
For old times' sake, I can't cancel the contract,

00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:01.615
but I can offer you an exchange.

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:05.185
An exchange?

00:44:15.295 --> 00:44:17.565
They're new, so they're a bit pricier.

00:44:20.635 --> 00:44:22.905
My goodness!

00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:32.745
(Rainbow Taxi)

00:44:34.845 --> 00:44:36.045
Come on.

00:44:46.265 --> 00:44:47.565
This is incredible.

00:44:50.895 --> 00:44:51.895
Choi!

00:45:02.605 --> 00:45:04.875
What are you staring at? Get the contract!

00:45:12.515 --> 00:45:13.525
What are you?

00:45:15.355 --> 00:45:17.555
- Go Eun. - Darn it.

00:45:19.965 --> 00:45:22.125
I learned to box too, you jerk!

00:45:22.365 --> 00:45:24.635
Weave, weave, one, two.

00:45:24.835 --> 00:45:27.105
Oh, gosh!

00:45:32.275 --> 00:45:33.675
Don't tell me it's over already.

00:45:35.145 --> 00:45:37.875
What are you talking about? We just got here to have some fun!

00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:41.885
Please help me!

00:45:44.055 --> 00:45:45.155
What are you talking about?

00:45:46.115 --> 00:45:47.855
I'm just a car salesman.

00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:01.635
So, are you buying or not?

00:46:25.725 --> 00:46:27.824
Byeong Jin. Funny you should mention it.

00:46:27.825 --> 00:46:29.635
I know guys dying to drive supercars.

00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:31.695
- I was just about to call you. - Round up all your guys.

00:46:32.365 --> 00:46:34.235
I'm sorry? I don't think I heard you right.

00:46:34.265 --> 00:46:36.735
I'll let you guys drive supercars for a whole year, free of charge.

00:46:37.705 --> 00:46:40.005
So get everyone together and tell them to gather right now.

00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:41.545
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

00:46:45.515 --> 00:46:47.315
You picked a fight with the wrong people.

00:46:48.415 --> 00:46:49.755
Darn it.

00:47:01.795 --> 00:47:02.825
Byeong Jin!

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:07.064
I told them they could drive free, and they came running like strays.

00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:09.264
Byeong Jin, where's the guy we're burying?

00:47:09.265 --> 00:47:10.705
Who is it?

00:47:13.545 --> 00:47:14.745
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:47:18.815 --> 00:47:19.845
What's all this?

00:47:20.215 --> 00:47:22.115
Get that jerk. Get him!

00:48:02.285 --> 00:48:06.095
These idiots can't even catch one taxi.

00:48:35.385 --> 00:48:37.225
Gosh. That thing's really fast.

00:48:41.295 --> 00:48:42.565
What on earth? Darn it!

00:48:43.835 --> 00:48:45.665
Driver Kim Do Gi, how close are you?

00:48:45.935 --> 00:48:47.105
I'm almost there.

00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:10.925
I got you.

00:49:19.865 --> 00:49:22.635
- Hey, block the exits first! - Yes, sir!

00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:25.035
- Where is he? - Move it!

00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:26.705
Spread out!

00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:29.974
Guys, don't you want to ride supercars?

00:49:29.975 --> 00:49:31.975
- Search every corner! - Come out.

00:49:32.075 --> 00:49:33.545
- Yes, sir! - Every corner!

00:49:48.565 --> 00:49:50.095
Stop him!

00:50:00.105 --> 00:50:01.845
Thanks for going to all the trouble of bringing these here.

00:50:03.105 --> 00:50:04.545
You saved me a lot on delivery fees.

00:50:05.575 --> 00:50:06.585
Delivery fees?

00:50:06.845 --> 00:50:09.185
That was the easiest delivery ever.

00:50:09.545 --> 00:50:12.155
You could've parked a little neater, though.

00:50:13.355 --> 00:50:15.025
I guess you're all just messed up in the head.

00:50:15.355 --> 00:50:18.495
Thanks to your cooperation, this whole job went a lot smoother.

00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:21.725
Moving them all by myself would've been hard.

00:50:23.335 --> 00:50:27.905
The contract said you'd be trading the new cars for these supercars.

00:50:29.935 --> 00:50:30.935
New cars?

00:50:40.115 --> 00:50:41.915
You must not have read the contract very carefully.

00:50:47.355 --> 00:50:48.425
What are you all standing around for?

00:50:49.025 --> 00:50:50.455
Kill that jerk!

00:50:51.355 --> 00:50:52.795
You scum!

00:50:54.965 --> 00:50:56.025
You jerk.

00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:14.815
- You walked in here voluntarily. - But you won't be walking out.

00:51:15.415 --> 00:51:16.415
You little punks.

00:51:32.795 --> 00:51:34.335
My goodness.

00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:05.295
Where are we?

00:53:06.425 --> 00:53:08.195
Hey, what's that over there?

00:53:14.805 --> 00:53:16.465
I'll give you one last chance.

00:53:17.905 --> 00:53:20.545
If you admit what you've done wrong, even now,

00:53:21.245 --> 00:53:23.875
and promise to compensate your victims,

00:53:24.775 --> 00:53:26.715
then I might just reconsider.

00:53:33.955 --> 00:53:38.395
- Just run him over. Go! Step on it! - Just run him over!

00:53:39.025 --> 00:53:41.295
How about you all think it over?

00:53:43.265 --> 00:53:45.495
Just die, you jerk!

00:53:50.405 --> 00:53:52.935
Turn around! It's a dead end!

00:54:02.315 --> 00:54:05.855
That car you're in. Doesn't it look a little familiar?

00:54:06.685 --> 00:54:07.724
- Boss! - What is it?

00:54:07.725 --> 00:54:09.185
This is one of the cars from our lot.

00:54:09.585 --> 00:54:12.295
- It's a flood-damaged car of ours. - What? Are you sure?

00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:14.725
I'm the one who stitched the airbag in this car!

00:54:15.165 --> 00:54:16.895
Stop the car now!

00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:22.665
- Stop the car, you jerk! - The brakes aren't working!

00:54:23.705 --> 00:54:27.105
You never thought you'd drive it, did you?

00:54:30.975 --> 00:54:33.075
- Turn the car! Hit the brakes! - The brakes!

00:54:33.545 --> 00:54:35.015
I said, stop the car!

00:54:35.685 --> 00:54:37.115
Hey, you jerk!

00:54:38.955 --> 00:54:41.655
- The pedal's not working! - Just slam on it!

00:54:49.795 --> 00:54:51.665
Now you get to experience it for yourselves...

00:54:52.735 --> 00:54:57.005
what it's like to be driving a ticking time bomb.

00:54:59.005 --> 00:55:01.545
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:55:07.415 --> 00:55:08.985
No!

00:55:13.055 --> 00:55:19.495
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:55:21.065 --> 00:55:22.925
Make sure you eat all of your lunch.

00:55:23.325 --> 00:55:25.335
Okay, I will. I'm heading out.

00:55:25.395 --> 00:55:29.065
- Drive safe. Ji Eun, be careful. - Okay.

00:55:29.965 --> 00:55:30.975
Dad.

00:55:31.735 --> 00:55:32.735
Ta-da!

00:55:33.275 --> 00:55:34.375
Here, have this while you're working.

00:55:34.905 --> 00:55:36.645
Your knees must hurt from sitting all day.

00:55:36.915 --> 00:55:39.015
Our daughter is so thoughtful.

00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:41.415
Since my sweet daughter is looking out for me,

00:55:41.885 --> 00:55:43.515
I feel reenergized already.

00:55:44.055 --> 00:55:45.384
I'm the best, right?

00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:47.225
Drive safe, and I'll see you later!

00:55:48.385 --> 00:55:49.385
Ji Eun.

00:55:49.655 --> 00:55:50.655
Yes?

00:55:51.195 --> 00:55:52.195
ASD.

00:55:53.155 --> 00:55:55.895
- ASD. - "ASD?" What does that mean?

00:55:56.525 --> 00:55:58.365
What's the inside joke?

00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:00.705
Another safe day.

00:56:01.865 --> 00:56:02.905
See you later.

00:56:13.985 --> 00:56:16.345
(Another Safe Day)

00:56:17.555 --> 00:56:18.885
All right.

00:56:48.915 --> 00:56:50.955
Vehicle 5283, ending service.

00:56:52.115 --> 00:56:53.755
Great work.

00:56:54.055 --> 00:56:55.455
You all did a great job.

00:56:55.855 --> 00:56:57.155
- Oh, right. - Yes?

00:56:57.225 --> 00:56:58.695
If we're going to resume business as usual tomorrow,

00:56:58.755 --> 00:57:01.065
we have to clean all the taxis we deliberately messed up.

00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:05.695
So the real work is just getting started for us, right?

00:57:07.965 --> 00:57:10.235
- I'll help out. - Me too.

00:57:11.005 --> 00:57:12.075
We should all pitch in.

00:57:12.275 --> 00:57:16.545
- I guess we're back to the grind. - Yes, sir.

00:57:22.585 --> 00:57:25.515
Look at the marbling on this meat.

00:57:26.255 --> 00:57:27.755
How long has it been since we had Korean beef?

00:57:29.455 --> 00:57:30.525
Pass me your plate.

00:57:32.625 --> 00:57:35.765
Here's a little to start. I'll bring more over.

00:57:39.635 --> 00:57:43.135
Driver Kim Do Gi, get over here before Chief Choi eats it all.

00:57:43.605 --> 00:57:47.445
That's hurtful. I've only had three pieces so far.

00:57:47.545 --> 00:57:50.515
- Already? I've only had one piece. - Better step it up.

00:57:50.745 --> 00:57:52.715
Come on, Do Gi, hurry up and sit down.

00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:54.045
All right.

00:57:56.445 --> 00:57:57.915
- Hurry up! - There he is.

00:58:00.755 --> 00:58:03.795
- Go on, have some. - Okay. Should we make a toast?

00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:04.895
Yes!

00:58:07.395 --> 00:58:09.695
- To a job well done! - Cheers!

00:58:09.795 --> 00:58:11.695
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:58:26.575 --> 00:58:30.045
(Watch Repair)

00:59:04.585 --> 00:59:07.785
(Don't die. Get revenge.)

00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:16.025
I'm going to kill them all.

00:59:42.955 --> 00:59:45.455
(We'd like to thank Yoon Si Yoon for his special appearance.)

01:00:04.245 --> 01:00:07.015
(Taxi Driver 3)

01:00:07.085 --> 01:00:10.485
Are you kidding me? Five months for murder?

01:00:10.785 --> 01:00:11.885
Fifteen years ago.

01:00:11.955 --> 01:00:15.925
I started the Deluxe Taxi service because of Dong Su.

01:00:15.985 --> 01:00:17.125
Min Ho.

01:00:17.895 --> 01:00:20.425
Dong Su, it's me. Don't you recognize me?

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:24.065
Then we'll have to move faster. Before his memories fade completely.

01:00:24.195 --> 01:00:28.265
Let's see how Im Dong Hyeon reacts to Park Min Ho showing up.

01:00:28.405 --> 01:00:30.264
Who is messing with me?

01:00:30.265 --> 01:00:32.905
Park Min Ho... Is he really dead?

01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:34.475
You're sure he was buried for good, right?
