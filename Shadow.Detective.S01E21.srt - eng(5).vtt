[Shadow Detective]

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.650
[Episode 21]

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.590
You mean

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.470
someone was outside the dock

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.000
monitoring our operation?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.360
That's right.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.360
At that time, our people

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.450
were either chasing
Sasaki’s men inside the port

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.510
or searching for Sasaki’s whereabouts

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.570
together with you.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.890
There was nobody outside the dock.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.750
And our guys said

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.290
that car left in a hurry.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.230
Our men couldn't catch up at all.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.450
Could it be the Butcher?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.840
It must be him.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.000
You heard the conversation
between Sasaki and him.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They must be fighting among themselves.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.680
The Butcher

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.590
pretended to make peace

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.400
but schemed behind our backs.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.000
We

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.100
were just being used as his pawns.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680
Who exactly is this Butcher?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.630
He's so devious and cunning.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.030
I've had a suspect in mind all along.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.000
Who?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.280
Gu Sinian.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.520
When we first entered Shop No. 7,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.750
I heard the Butcher's voice

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.840
and it sounded familiar,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.910
but I couldn't place
who it was at the time.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.000
After thinking carefully,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.190
that voice sounds
very similar to Gu Sinian's.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.240
But many people have similar voices.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.900
This doesn't prove anything.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.079
There's something else that puzzles me.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.910
Huang Kaiyuan was
at the Hongkou Police Room.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.630
Only a few of us knew about this,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.690
so how did Tang Jiahao find him there?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.400
Then I realized,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.230
there was someone else present.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.020
Gu Sinian.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.120
But he was injured too,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.850
and he's still in the hospital.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.180
Could it be a self-inflicted injury?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.840
Unfortunately,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.800
none of this counts as

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.130
substantial evidence.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.360
If we confront him without proof,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.620
it would be too abrupt.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.540
We don't need to alert him.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.710
Let's just pretend we're visiting him.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.150
It's quite a distance
from the dock to the hospital.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.630
If he really is the Butcher,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.750
he probably isn't in the hospital now.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.000
Then let's go see

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.600
if this recovering Dr. Gu

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.730
is actually lying in his hospital bed.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.980
Alright, let's go.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.000
Sasaki's autopsy report is ready.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.750
Just leave it here.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.390
We don't have time to read it.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.970
We need to go to the hospital.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.920
I'll ask you
if I have any questions later.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.070
Can I join you?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.409
I'd like to visit that girl
in the hospital too.

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.409
Sure, let's go.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.210
Let's go.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.040
[Shanghai Ren'ai Hospital]

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.430
Could it be...

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.240
Dr. Gu.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.430
Well, this is unexpected.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.230
You actually came to see me
so early in the morning.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.430
We came to see

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.760
how you're recovering.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.150
I'm recovering well.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.480
Just can't fight getting old.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.040
My physical recovery

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.370
isn't what it used to be.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.590
You were injured because of us.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.620
We were really worried,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020
so we came to check on you.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.160
It's my duty.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.460
I'll definitely help if I can.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.720
Besides,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.000
I didn't really do much.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.190
Your presence

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.530
is already helping us.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.210
Enough said.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.340
You...

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.360
They accompanied me to the doctor,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.020
so we came together to see you.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.270
Director Du, your complexion

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.360
doesn't look like
that of someone who's sick.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.530
Young people recover quickly.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.710
By the way, Lu.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.870
Have you stopped taking the medicine
I gave you last time?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.530
Yes, I have.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.720
Have you told Inspector Guan

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.480
that someone might have
switched your medication?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.210
Yes, she has.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.050
Lu Yizhen told me about this
a few days ago.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.490
After she told me,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.930
I was very concerned.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.680
I specifically called
the nurse to ask about it.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.910
But the nurse...

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.290
She...

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.910
She...

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.630
Dr. Gu.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.680
What's wrong, Dr. Gu?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.610
Are you alright?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.120
Dr. Gu.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.040
Dr. Gu?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.510
Nurse!

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.480
What happened?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.280
What's wrong?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.340
Move aside.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.760
Dr. Gu, are you okay?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.950
Where does it hurt?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.880
Don't move me. It's fine.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.480
Come on, get up. Take it slow.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.070
It's nothing.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.040
The patient hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.720
At this hour,

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.480
you really shouldn't
be disturbing his rest.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.190
If his condition worsens,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.870
will you take responsibility?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.930
We're truly sorry.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.860
We just wanted to see

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.260
how Dr. Gu is recovering.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.300
I just need to rest a bit.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.390
Well,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.150
you should rest now.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.170
We'll come back another day to talk more.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.220
Thank you, nurse.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.480
Please take good care of Dr. Gu.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.070
Let's go.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.160
We'll be going now, Dr. Gu.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.620
We're leaving now, Dr. Gu.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.720
I told you to rest properly.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.820
Why were you out of bed?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.280
And with so many visitors.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.360
It's cold.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.060
I put on an extra layer.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.240
Lu Yizhen.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.040
Why didn't you tell me

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.570
about the medication
being switched before?

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.260
I forgot.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.340
You forgot?

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.090
How could you forget
something so important?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.600
Don't hide things from me anymore.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.360
You need to tell me everything about you.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.020
I can't let you get hurt again.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.630
I... I didn't mean to.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.159
Alright, why so serious?

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.560
I'll tell you everything
from now on, okay?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.310
No matter how big or small,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.910
you must tell me everything.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.950
I don't know everything about you either.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.150
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.910
-That girl...
-That girl...

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.120
How is she doing?

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.240
The girl still refuses to talk.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.750
Let's go see her then.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.770
We've done
a forensic examination on her before.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.750
Today we're checking on her condition.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.630
But her emotional state
is still very unstable.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.600
Don't upset her.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.960
Can I know your name?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.650
How old are you?

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.400
I don't know.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.390
I don't know. I don't know.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.550
Okay. Okay.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.640
You don't know. You don't know.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.270
I don't know how old
you were when you were taken.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.870
But I was seven.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.240
So you see,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.020
we have the same experience.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.550
I won't hurt you.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.880
Xiaodie.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.040
Xiaodie.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.480
Do you remember

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.080
when you were taken there?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.550
So long ago.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.020
So painful.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.550
How much do you remember

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.080
about what happened there?

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.840
They... They beat me.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.600
And...

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.790
And...

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.590
Did you see other girls there?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.960
I heard

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.940
other girls' voices.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.870
Brother, brother!

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.790
Do you know where they are?

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.200
Okay.

I was actually thinking about

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.780
how they select their human cargo

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.840

we don't even know

I don't know what kind
of treatment she's endured.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.100
When I was rescuing
that person that day, I wondered

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.760
if that girl could be Jingning.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.820
I really hope she's still alive.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.400
Finding her

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.450
has been my obsession for all these years.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.850
But I'm also afraid of her being alive.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.480
If she is still alive,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.750
how much suffering has she endured

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.950

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.390
Why the long face?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.280
Do you have time these days?

They'll work things out themselves.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.480
So this is where you
wanted to come to relax?

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.270
Yes.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.839

I borrowed it specially for today.

"Why is Lu Yizhen so stupid?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.060

to work at the patrol room?"

I'm not thinking about anything strange.

Well, nothing much to do during the day,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.730
so I came out to clear my head.

That's nice.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.270
It's just a pity

Well,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.380
maybe you shouldn't go
if you don't have a partner.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.770
You don't want me to go?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.110
No,

h-how can you go?

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.410
I think you'd be perfect.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.640
Why don't you be my dance partner?

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.550
You look so troubled.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:18.780
Forget it.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920
I'll go by myself.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.110
All right.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.840
It would be my honor

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.970
to be Dr. Ding's dance partner.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.030
Great.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.140
How long has this case
been under investigation?

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.800
Why hasn't it been solved yet?

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.440
We've been investigating continuously.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.580
Everyone in the department

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.270
has been working on it for months.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.960
We've had no leads

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.240
and no progress so far.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.680
If you don't solve this case soon,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.680
you can kiss your position goodbye.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.080
It's up to you now.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.570
Inspector Guan, you're here too.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.580
Inspector Zhu.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.410
How's the case you're working on?

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.810
No need for your concern, Inspector Zhu.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.110
I'm about to report to Director Huo.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.010
You don't need my concern now.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.550
But perhaps later

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.850
you'll need it.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.330
Just get used to it.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.140
Since you don't want to share,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.700
I won't ask further.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.810
Inspector Zhu.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.870
Why are you so slow?

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.790
Take it over quickly.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.240
Yes.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.070
What does he mean by saying
we'll need his concern later?

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.920
I don't know.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.450
Take it away.

The Zhuo Chaoxiong case

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.030
is going nowhere.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.110
And now

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.380
the Sasaki case is piling on top.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.840
The British have given me an ultimatum.

as Director of the Police Department?

please rest assured.

We will do everything
in our power to catch the killer

this position for decades.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.360

can this be repaired?

Almost done.

Just a few more hours.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.240
This is Skylark Company's
human trafficking business.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.240
The person we rescued last time

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.840
was their surviving victim.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.330
The human trafficking business
belongs to the Butcher.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.660
And the Butcher works for Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.440
Zhuo Chaoxiong is in charge of contraband

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.000
and human trafficking
at Tianque Trading Company.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.060
He's an important figure in the gang.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.590
Zhuo Feng must be connected to them too.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.990
We've been suspecting Gu Sinian all along.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.460
Should we still
investigate in this direction?

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.860
Insufficient evidence. Let's start over.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.900
The badge Yang Xiaolin gave us

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.240
was probably from Zhuo Feng, right?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.110
When Yang Xiaolin gave you
the badge last time,

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.840
she said we have a common enemy.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.960
She must be connected
to the kidnapping case from back then.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.960
She's also looking for the Butcher?

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.390
Now Huang Kaiyuan,

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.570
Sasaki and Zhuo Chaoxiong are all dead.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.110
The killer might be the same person.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.840
Tang Jiahao.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.790
He can't be the Butcher, can he?

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.240
No.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.500
The Butcher wouldn't do it himself.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.440
Then he must be working for the Butcher.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.630
They pretended to cooperate with Sasaki,

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.490
but were secretly setting him up.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.750
But they're all
from the Skylark Company.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.750
What's their purpose in doing this?

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.240
According to our previous theory,

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.510
Tang Jiahao

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.550
murdered Zhuo Chaoxiong,

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.840
then worried Huang Kaiyuan
would leak information,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.120
so he silenced him.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.000
And now he's killed

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.270
the Captain who was on equal footing
with the Butcher.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.280
-He wants to get promoted.

I found it here.
