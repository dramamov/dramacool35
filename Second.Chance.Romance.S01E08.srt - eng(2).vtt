[Episode 8]

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.900
Mr. Gao.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.740
Mr. Gao,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.180
what's up?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.020
Where is your director?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.580
He has off work.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.420
Please come back tomorrow
during the day.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.220
Off work?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.420
Who are you?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.180
I've not seen you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.700
before.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.820
I'm Shi Wei from the Finance Department.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.940
I look forward to your guidance.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.540
Okay.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.700
Transfer the money to me.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.580
I need it urgently.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.340
I, I can't make that decision.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.820
Can't make the decision?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.620
I can't.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.380
You're so pretty and you can't?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.020
I, I really can't.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.740
Please come back tomorrow.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.860
I understand.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.740
You have procedures.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.340
But Ms. Gao has approved it.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.340
Come on.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.780
Come here.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.220
Let me teach you.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.620
Put your hand

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.780
right here.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.100
Click it.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.740
See? That's it!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.420
No, this won't work.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.060
Mr. Gao,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.260
you've drunk too much.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.140
Fine.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.900
I'll go to your director tomorrow.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.580
I'm busy now.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.940
Have to hang up.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.100
Bye-bye.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.380
Who were you on the phone with?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.500
A friend.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.540
I've eaten.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.060
Takeout again?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.740
If it continues, your gut may protest.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.940
Guess it's fine.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.500
I heard

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.460
you sponsored Siting's school.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.460
Well done,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.820
Wang Zeyuan.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.780
You went all out this time.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.420
What are you talking about?

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.140
What am I talking about?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.500
Do you think I'm blind?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.100
Even Bao knows about your secrets.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.060
How could I not know?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.140
After all these years,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.900
I'm clear about what's on your mind.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.420
I like her. What's the problem?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.980
Nothing at all.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.420
We're both single.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.540
No strings attached, no obligations.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.380
Any problem?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.020
No.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.860
Shuhan,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.500
do you think I have a chance

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.540
now that she's back?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.940
There is a chance,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.500
but it's quite slim.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.380
After all these years,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.100
you have no sense of reality.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.500
Please stop daydreaming

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.540
about Siting.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.020
You know the situation, right?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.220
You...

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.820
Don't meddle in my affairs.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.980
As your sister,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.260
I have to look out for you.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.380
I'm an adult now.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.420
Don't want interference.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.540
Besides, I think I'm doing fine.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.820
Thanks for the reminder.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.300
Oh, right,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.220
I'll be going out later.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.940
Should I drop you off?

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.460
Alright.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.340
Don't put on the air.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.780
Are you kicking me out?

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.860
I'll go.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.860
Make sure you finish all of these later.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.900
I made them myself.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.140
Wash them after you eat.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.540
I won't see you off.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.580
Goodbye.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.300
Yes.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.580
Right.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.220
Yeah.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.100
Need another fifty cases.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.660
Yes.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.380
Cabernet Sauvignon.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.620
Okay.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.020
Is that correct?

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.260
Hao,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.940
two extra orders.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.740
See if they were added.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.060
Added?

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.580
Let me check.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.100
Okay.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.620
Good.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.580
Thank you.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.900
They've been added.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.820
Sir,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.220
our 2017 vintage wine
is going to sell like hotcakes.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.780
You mentioned having some extra stock.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.500
Is this it?

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.340
My phone has been ringing off the hook!

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.780
I haven't had a break all morning.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.060
You've worked hard.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.860
Handle all the orders on your hands

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.260
and leave work early.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.460
Really?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.820
Thank you.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.900
You're such a kind person.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.340
I was worrying about not watering
the flowers this morning.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.540
If they wither and die,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.540
I would cry my eyes out.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.180
Did you hear that?

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.180
What?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.140
She likes flowers.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.060
Likes flowers?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.260
She likes flowers!

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.260
But I know nothing about flowers.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.820
After you finish your work,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.700
I'll take you to buy some flowers.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.780
The earlier the better.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.140
Okay.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540
As a man, take the initiative.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.900
So many flowers. How to choose?

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.460
Look.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.900
So many options here.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.700
If you don't know how to choose,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.620
roses

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.860
will be the simplest and most direct way

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.220
to express your feelings.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.580
That may seem too forward.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.780
Too forward?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.980
Then try the balloon flower.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.900
It's a bit more subtle.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.700
This is the balloon flower?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.620
Madam,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.300
do you sell Velvet?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.420
It's sold out.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.380
Please look somewhere else.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.260
Thank you.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.980
Madam,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.740
do you sell Velvet?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.460
I don't have it.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.700
Turn left ahead.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.020
That shop at the corner should have it.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.660
Go and take a look.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.260
Thanks.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.980
Rui,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.540
what flower is that?

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.940
That's

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.300
Velvet.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.700
Velvet works too!

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.780
A girl would like it
if you give it to her.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.100
Madam.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.580
Please take a look.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.500
Please get me that bunch of Velvet.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.060
Here.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.700
Okay.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.140
This one is indeed prettier.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.900
I'll take this bunch.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.500
Alright.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:17.780
Okay.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.820
Please scan here.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.100
Okay.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.500
Forty yuan.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.180
Not bad!

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.420
This looks nice.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.020
Qi should like it.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.380
Madam,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.860
do you sell Velvet?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.100
Miss, sorry.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.900
The last bunch was sold to them.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.180
If you're not in a hurry,
I can reserve one for you.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.980
That would work.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.340
Madam,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.460
we'd like to change it.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.820
The roses from before.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.220
You want the roses?

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.980
We don't want this one.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.220
Thank you.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.260
Then,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.460
this is good.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.340
It's also forty.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.980
Don't need to pay again.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.540
Alright.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.100
Alright.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.900
Thank you!

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.500
This one works too!

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:54.860
Velvet.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.740
Okay.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.380
Thank you! How much?

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.220
Qi will like this better.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.740
Great.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.220
Okay.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.460
Let's go.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:00.980
Go.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.660
You can scan here.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:01.940
Alright.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.580
Rui,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.700
I'll be waiting for you in the car.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.660
What a coincidence.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.940
Never thought that after so many years,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.100
you still like Velvet.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.980
I accompanied a colleague here.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.340
That day, I saw
Peiyan liked Velvet very much,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.820
so I came to get some.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.380
This bunch is for her.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.100
Could you help me

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.740
take this back to her?

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.460
Let me pay you.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.380
No need.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.300
She and I are colleagues.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.700
No need to be formal.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.300
Alright.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.460
Thank you on behalf of Peiyan.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.820
But

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.420
I really think

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.780
Velvet would be a very suitable choice

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.060
for the bridal bouquet at your wedding.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.580
What brings you here?

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.820
This

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.340
is for you.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.780
So this is Velvet.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:58.940
Yes.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.900
Why did you give me flowers

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.100
all of a sudden?

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.300
Do you still have class?

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.300
Yes, one more.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.100
Then go ahead.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.140
Thank you.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.500
I really like it.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:18.860
I'll head off.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.180
Okay.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.620
Ms. Wen,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.500
how is the wedding preparation going?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.700
Almost there.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.580
You've prepared for so long.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.020
We're looking forward to it.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.340
Once the date is set,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.780
I'll inform you right away.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.380
We have to be there.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.900
These flowers are beautiful.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.300
Thank you.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.380
I'll go back to work.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.420
Okay.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.900
Students in the second row,
see your parents?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.220
Yes!

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.420
Go.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.700
Did you say goodbye to your classmates?

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.420
Yes!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:57.820
Off you go.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.660
Take care.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.340
How's the homework load today?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.420
It's okay.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:03.740
Alright.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.020
Math is a bit tough.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.260
I might need your help.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.380
Helping you is no problem,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.100
but don't have me do all of it for you.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.020
Hello, Lin.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.220
Any orders?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.260
I feel hot.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.260
The air conditioning is on.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.620
Stronger wind.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.180
Don't take this seat.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.180
Dad, you're being so naggy.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.060
Dad,

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.580
where is Ms. Wen?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900
Why didn't she come?

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.660
They'll be home a little later.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.900
What's wrong?

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.660
I've always picked you up, right?

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.620
That's true.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.540
You've got Ms. Wen now,

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.860
so forget about me, huh?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.340
Our private time must be preserved.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.260
So you…

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.140
Right!

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.060
Before they come back,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.780
let's play rounds of games.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.940
Okay, let's go.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.860
Don't let them find out.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.580
Quick!

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.260
Ms. Wen.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:45.860
Madam,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.260
what can I do for you?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.300
Here's the thing.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.620
You said you wanted

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.700
to hold a solo concert.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.900
I have contacted

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.860
the venue and worked out the process.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.860
Now they need your personal information.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.980
We'll meet with them again.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.940
We may follow the process
during this time.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.340
That's wonderful,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.820
Madam.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.140
I will prepare the material

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.300
as soon as possible

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.180
and hand it over to you.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:09.660
Alright.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.860
If I can hold the concert
before the wedding,

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.380
my life would be complete.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.020
What? You're getting married?

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.060
It's in the works.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.340
Congratulations!

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.260
Thank you.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.420
Beautiful flowers.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.380
Thanks.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.900
Alright, get back to work.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.660
I'll be heading off now.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.060
Thank you, Madam.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.740
No problem.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.200
[Music room]

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.500
Come on, Shuhan.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.740
Take these to the kitchen.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.780
You could've just come over.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.100
No need to buy so much food.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.220
So many plastic bags.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.860
We might order food online.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.420
That's different.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.820
Food online is not fresh.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.100
These vegetables

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.620
were grown by our neighbor, Ms. Zhao.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.860
Alright, I get it now.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.100
Let me handle this.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.580
Take a break.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.940
Anyway, you'll cook later.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.940
I'll not lift a finger.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.340
Is Yuan's company busy lately?

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.020
Yes.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260
A new game is set to launch soon.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.700
He's

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.420
so busy that he has been staying

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.580
at his office.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.140
Why is that?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.020
Being a boss

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.060
is busier than being an employee.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.860
Doesn't make sense.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.220
You just don't get it.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.820
A boss has to handle so many things

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.700
at the company all day long.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.300
Certainly, he is busy.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.460
It's not like being an employee.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.260
Alright, Mom, stop wiping.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.220
I can call a cleaning service later.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.700
How long has it been
since you last cleaned?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.620
Cleaning service?

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.740
Stop wasting money on that.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.060
I really don't know

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.460
why you're so busy.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.420
You should find some time
to do the cleaning.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.820
Exactly.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.300
You're lazy.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.900
Fine, I'm lazy.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.100
I'm the laziest person in the world.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.700
Madam, let me do it. Take a break.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.260
Okay.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.180
Clean my hands.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.860
This flower

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.540
is quite rare.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.460
From Rui?

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.100
He's quite romantic now.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.620
I haven't seen

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.220
this kind of flower before.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.380
Ms. Tan

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.500
introduced me to it

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.100
when we checked the venue,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.020
so I found out about it.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.540
It really is beautiful.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.860
Is she

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.580
still teaching at your place?

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.340
Yes.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.020
One class a week.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.540
She used

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.620
to pursue Rui,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.220
but he ignored her.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.460
Ms. Tan

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.540
is quite humorous.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.580
Last time, she joked

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.300
that she was Rui's first love.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.700
Keep your distance from her.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.620
Madam,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.020
please rest assured.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.860
Rui is outstanding,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.380
so it's normal for him to have admirers.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.620
And I think

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.980
he is much more attentive

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.380
to the wedding than before.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:27.620
Look,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.340
he gifted me with flowers.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:32.900
That's good then.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.300
Dad,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.020
when is your wedding?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.820
Have you set a date yet?

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.500
Not yet. Why?

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.420
You've been acting strange lately.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.620
No.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.220
Yes.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.820
Definitely!

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.460
Hey.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.180
Are you getting cold feet
about marriage?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:54.980
No way.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.300
Men never mess up at the crucial moment.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.980
If anything confuses you,

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.860
tell me.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.100
I'll help you sort it out.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.460
Nothing confuses me.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.420
You're

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.340
only twelve years old,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.620
yet the way you talk is grown-up!

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.380
You're getting married soon,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.500
and Ms. Wen is going to join our family.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.300
So I have to consider you

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.460
and protect her

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.300
from harm.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.900
Don't you agree with this?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.980
Another round.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.500
Shuhan,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.060
how's it going with Huang?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.300
We broke up.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:30.740
Broke up?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.500
But you were just starting to date.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.700
Why did you break up?

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.220
Well,

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.180
when it isn't right, we broke up.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.980
No one is ever suitable to you.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.620
Changed partners now and then.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.660
Isn't it embarrassing if this gets out?

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.940
Dad, it's the 21st century!

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.340
Is it against the law to break up

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.700
because it isn't working out?

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.100
You should be self-respecting.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.780
You're

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.700
in your thirties, almost forty.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.220
Stop being so irresponsible.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.700
Be more responsible for yourself.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.700
What your dad said

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.780
really makes sense.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.900
When I was your age,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.980
you and Yuan were in elementary school.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.900
Look at you.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.140
Just look at your state.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.020
Forget about having kids,

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.540
you change boyfriends more often

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.980
than you change clothes.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.700
Do you know

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.620
what our neighbors think?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.540
How do they see it?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.860
They bring
up the most uncomfortable topics.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.300
Whenever they see us,
they talk about you.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.540
Bad enough when they say it
to our faces,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.780
but behind our backs,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.740
they must be making up stories.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.180
Right?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.580
What did I tell you before?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500
I asked

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.540
you two to move in with me.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.100
If not with me,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.220
live with Yuan.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.060
Where you're living now

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.300
has nothing you need.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.540
It's inconvenient to do anything.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.380
Now is great!

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.220
Living there, you hear gossip
all day long.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.980
We've lived there for decades.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.020
That's our home

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.140
and your roots.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.340
Never

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.740
forget where you came from.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.260
Yes, we're used to living there.
It's convenient.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.260
If we live here,

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.980
our lifestyle habits are different,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.020
so we'll die of frustration.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.540
Oh my goodness!

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.540
Who knows who will be frustrated?

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.980
Stop being cheeky!

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.380
I'm just worried

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.980
that you and Yuan may not be able

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.060
to take good care of yourselves.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.580
For example, Yuan

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.500
is too busy with company matters

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.540
to even eat properly.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.500
Can it go on like this?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.140
There are so many nice girls
in this city,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.260
yet he likes none.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.300
Don't meddle

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.380
in our matters.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.700
I really don't want to.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.140
By the way, Mom,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.660
Siting is back.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.100
Siting?

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.700
Tan's daughter?

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.420
Yeah,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.500
Tan Siting.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.620
We did ballet together
when we were kids.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.020
She went abroad years ago, right?

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.540
Yes.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.500
She's back?

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.300
Recently.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.860
Does Yuan know?

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.580
Of course he knows.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.620
Not only does he know,

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.180
but he was overjoyed.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.900
He's still stuck on her, is he?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.500
I just told you

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.740
not to meddle in our matters.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.260
Besides,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.820
Siting is doing well now.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.100
She's a teacher at a ballet school.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.820
Yuan even sponsored her

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.660
to support her career.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.180
Sponsored her?

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.540
Dad,

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.580
I always make mistakes
with triangle calculations.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.580
Which one?

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.500
This one.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.420
This one, yes.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:19.940
Calculate it like this.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.860
These two sides,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.060
AE over PA

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.420
equals three times ten.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.380
Equals one-half.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.260
Then,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.500
the sine of AF is

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.580
AF over PA,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.980
which equals sine sixty degrees,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.220
and that's one-half

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.780
root three.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.060
Alright, so AF equals

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.260
one-half root three.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.260
There we go.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.500
Now look.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.500
Wait.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.580
What are

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.980
trigonometric function formulas?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.820
Haven't you

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.700
learned them yet?

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.260
Never heard of them.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.580
That's beyond my level.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.420
Haven't heard of it?

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.180
We won't learn that

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.260
until middle school.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:09.820
Haven't learned?

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.260
I'm only in Grade six.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:14.860
I remember

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.980
we learned it back in elementary school.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.620
No?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.700
Forget it.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.380
I'll ask you about model aircraft,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.740
but I'll figure out the math stuff
on my own.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.020
Good thing I didn't write that down,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.260
or I'd be scolded by my teacher.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.380
Let me try your method.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:34.980
Coming.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.020
No need to bring gifts.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.500
Leave them to me.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.380
I couldn't come empty-handed.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.900
Mom, Dad,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:42.980
Siting is here.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.220
Hello there!

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.100
Mrs. Wang.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:46.980
Ting.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.580
Mr. Wang.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.420
After so many years apart,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.660
you're still so pretty and dignified.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:53.740
You're more dignified.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.300
Mr. Wang also looks great.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.340
Are you both doing well?

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.420
Yes!

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.260
Sit down and talk.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.660
Ting,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.940
we know

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.500
you danced exceptionally well abroad.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.020
Coming.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.260
I've retired now,

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.180
and I'm teaching students.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.660
We're very happy about this.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.580
Mr. Wang.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.100
Shuhan.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.060
Hurry inside.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.980
Everything's fine.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.500
Stop looking.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.220
Let's talk inside.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.660
Yuan,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.940
why so late today?

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.100
Hurry.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.740
Guys.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.820
Let's cook.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.420
Ms. Wen, what are we gonna eat today?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:28.620
Go

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.420
ask your dad

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.180
to eat.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.820
He is deeply engrossed in reading

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.500
my sixth-grade math textbook.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.700
When tutoring me in math,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.500
he taught me middle school-level stuff.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:38.820
I was speechless.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.300
You have to understand…

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.700
He was the third top science student
back in his day.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.460
He won awards
in Math Olympiads every year.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.780
You've told me that
like a hundred times.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.780
Although I didn't inherit

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.300
his talent for academics,

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.140
my artistic talent

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.380
is simply unparalleled.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.340
Watch closely now!

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.860
That's enough.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.420
Wash your hands.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.300
Have you?

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.220
I have. Smell them.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.020
They smell nice.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.620
You haven't decided
on the wedding dress.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.900
The boss just called

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.820
and told me new styles have arrived.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.220
When will you two take a look?

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.940
No rush for this.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.140
This depends on

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.460
whether Rui has the time.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.860
I...

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.700
I'm fine with anything.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.540
You shall arrange it.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.460
That's good then.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:40.980
Alright.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.460
Come on.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.300
Time to eat.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:43.740
Okay.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.060
Let's start.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.780
Again,

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.420
you cooked for us. Thank you.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.940
"Thank you" again?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.100
Try the fish.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.580
Eat up.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.340
Come on now.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.380
Let's start eating!

00:24:59.380 --> 00:24:59.820
One, two, three.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.620
Here you go.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.140
Okay.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:01.740
Here.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.860
Grandma, have the fish first.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.380
You eat first.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.260
Serve Grandma first.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.660
I'll dig in.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.020
Let's dig in.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.900
Thank you.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.540
All dishes are your childhood favorites.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:15.580
Let's eat.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:15.980
Come on!

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.460
Ting,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.020
see if it has that same old flavor?

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.580
Thank you.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.300
Have more.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.420
This is my favorite.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.340
Eat some fish.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.180
Isn't this your favorite?

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:26.700
It's delicious.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.460
Delicious, right?

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.140
Ting,

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.300
being abroad for so many years,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.540
do you have a partner yet?

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.980
No, still single.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.260
I'm used to being on my own now.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.860
If I remember correctly,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.780
you and Shuhan are the same age.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.860
Right. That's why I'm single.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.980
Look!

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.140
I'm talking about you.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.100
When I was around your age,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.740
both of them

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.020
were in elementary school.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.540
She said that a moment ago.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.860
Mom, why rush when she isn't?

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.140
Don't meddle in.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.860
And you too!

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:58.940
You're old enough.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.580
Your high school classmates

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.620
have married and had kids already.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.060
Mom, this is annoying!

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.740
After you get married,

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.580
she won't say another word.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.540
Yes, once you get married, I'll stop.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.540
Of all ways to fail as a son,
leaving no heir is the worst.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.580
Whether you buy a house
or a car isn't important.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.540
What's crucial

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.140
is to continue our family line.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:19.780
Right?

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.460
Ting,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:27.500
look.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.220
You've known each other for years.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.300
Yuan is like your own little brother.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.700
His career has done exceptionally well

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.540
these past couple of years.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.660
He's become picky.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.460
In the future,

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.900
if you come across any nice girls,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.460
remember to introduce them to him.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.020
Mom.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.580
Mrs. Wang is right.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.260
Yuan is like my own little brother.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.180
Since you have spoken up today,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.300
I'll introduce someone to him.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.180
Great!

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.140
But everyone I know

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.700
is involved in ballet.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.860
There seems to be a pretty nice girl
in our community.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.020
She's young and pretty,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.980
with a good character.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.740
If it works out, then...

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:18.460
Great.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.140
Let's meet sometime soon.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.580
We trust your recommendation.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.100
Right?

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.380
Those who do ballet

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.980
are too beautiful.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.660
Yuan can't handle someone like that.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.580
Exactly!

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.220
Those in ballet

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.900
are too gorgeous

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.900
and too outstanding.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.620
Yuan

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.900
needs a gentle,

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.580
virtuous, and good homemaker

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.420
suitable for daily life.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.740
Right, Yuan?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.900
Mom, Dad!

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.780
You talked so much.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.620
Are you hungry?

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.380
Yes.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.420
Eat if you're hungry.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:51.980
Eat.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.740
Go on, eat.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.420
Eat.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.260
Have some more!

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.180
Eat a lot!

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.820
Alright, let's eat.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.060
If it weren't for their cooking,

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.380
I wouldn't let them come here.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.140
Stop and eat.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.100
She hasn't lost her childhood self.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.420
Hurry up and eat!

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:06.940
Have some more.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:07.940
Eat up.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.420
Have more.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.900
The food is indeed quite good.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.180
This dish is delicious.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.660
Right.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.940
If it weren't for their cooking,

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.220
I wouldn't have let them come here.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.260
Ting,

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.260
come by often when you have time.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.660
Okay.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.100
Please head back.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:26.580
Alright.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.540
I'm so sorry.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.860
No need to see me out. Go back.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:29.620
It's okay.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.500
Take care.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.300
I'm leaving now.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:31.940
Alright.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.060
Yuan,

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.780
we know

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.580
that for all these years,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.220
you have had feelings for Ting.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.180
She is a good girl.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.540
We all like her too.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.900
But the neighborhood

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.820
knows her past.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.340
If you get involved with her,

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.940
we'll be the talk of the town!

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.340
Everyone has a past.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:00.780
The bowl.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.300
Do you even know

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.620
what kind of person she is?

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.140
It's useless for us to know,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.700
as the neighbors will remind us

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.820
what kind of person she is.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:11.540
Yuan,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.540
your father cares deeply
about his reputation.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.980
He is proud of you.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.900
Yet you just had to go

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.740
and embarrass him like that.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.900
Trying to make us a subject of gossip?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.340
Mom, please stop talking.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.700
You made me invite her over for a meal.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.500
What kind of meal is this?

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.340
It's a trap!

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.780
Why did you say that at the table?

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.180
Yuan,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.860
you're my own brother.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.460
Ting is my good friend.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.540
I want both of you to be happy.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.180
But you know

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.500
she doesn't have feelings for you.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.100
If you approach it this way,

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.300
it will put pressure on her.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.900
Have you considered her feelings?

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.540
Shuhan,

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.220
Dad, Mom,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.620
I like her.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.580
I've liked her since I first met her.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.220
This is my own business.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.340
It has nothing to do with you.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.620
I'm leaving.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.100
Wait...

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:27.760
[Wang Zeyuan]

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.200
[Wang Zeyuan]

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360
[Wen Peiyan]

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:20.740
Peiyan.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.940
When will you get out of work today?

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.100
Don't forget
we'll try on the wedding dress.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.580
I remember.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.420
After finishing
this afternoon's matters,

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.940
I'll head over.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.420
If I get late, check it out first.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.180
Anyway, my suit has been ordered.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:36.740
Okay.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.900
Then get back to work.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.500
I'll be okay on my own.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.780
Alright.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:21.780
Hello.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.460
Hello,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.820
Ms. Tan.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.420
Are you free in a little while?

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.140
The wedding dress is altered.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.820
Feng Rui said he will be late.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.260
Could you come with me to take a look?

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.300
I'm free.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.700
As long as I can help you

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.500
and not cause any trouble for you.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.020
How could that be?

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.380
I really need your advice.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:39.580
Alright then.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.460
See you in a bit.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.220
Okay.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:41.820
See you later.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.740
Alright, bye-bye.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:43.580
Bye-bye.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.940
A video?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.660
But I have to change clothes later.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.780
I'll send you a photo instead.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.140
Okay, bye-bye!

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.420
He even asked for a video?

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.020
Yeah, it was Le.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.300
He wants me to take a photo
and send it to him.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.700
Says he needs a say in the matter.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.420
So cute and clever.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.900
Isn't he coming today?

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:12.980
He has a training class.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.220
Feels like you get along well with him.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.940
That's quite rare.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.420
Yes, it is.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.980
I've been teaching him piano for years.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.620
When I first met him,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.300
he was only about this tall.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.900
Now he's past my shoulder,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.060
almost as tall as me.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.660
As you know,

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.020
it's not easy for Rui

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.420
to raise a child by himself.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.340
So in daily life,

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.580
I try to take care of him
whenever I can.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.940
When he can't pick Le up on time,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.180
Le will wait in our class.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.260
I remember when he was little,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.460
he was so funny

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.780
and asked me,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.980
"Ms. Wen, do you have a boyfriend?

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.900
My dad is single too.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.500
Do you want to meet each other?"

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.340
I laughed at that moment.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:33:59.860
I thought

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.820
this little kid knew nothing.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.340
Later on, he told me

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.540
he felt his dad was very lonely,

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.500
like a goose from the flock

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.380
that had fallen behind,

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.340
needing a partner.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.260
He said he felt

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.180
I was the goose he needed.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.500
So I asked him, "Why me?"

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.500
He said, "I like the way you smell.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.020
It's a little bit like Mom."

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.900
When I heard those words,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.140
I felt so heartbroken for him.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.460
That's why over these years,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.220
I've always treated him as my own.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.260
Are we almost there?

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.460
Yes, we're near.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.460
Mr. Du.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.380
No.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.380
No.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.100
No.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.860
The 2017 vintage was
in extremely high demand.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:53.900
I'm not refusing to sell it to you.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:54.780
Sir.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.580
There's one case left.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.420
One case.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.460
There's one case.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.060
A customer just returned a case.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:01.860
Yes.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.980
I'll send the order over right away.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.180
Thank you.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.460
How are things at the winery?

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.740
All orders are prepared

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.460
and ready for dispatch.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.580
Finally, it's all done!

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.020
You have worked hard.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:17.740
Sir,

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.380
after this busy period,

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.820
I want a couple of days off.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.540
Just you?

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.820
Or you two together?

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.820
Take four days.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.340
Thank you.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.140
These flowers

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:37.980
are nice.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.340
Thanks, sir.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.420
Thank you.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.140
This shop is really quite busy.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.740
Yeah.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.020
Hard to get an appointment here.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.740
Thanks for today.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:52.780
Don't mention it.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.500
You came with me again.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.100
No problem.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:54.620
Just a moment, please.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.260
Thank you.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.020
It's nothing.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.780
Madam,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.100
what brings you here?

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.900
Weren't you on your way to pick up Le?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.100
I sent Lu to get him.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.740
Today, you're trying on wedding dresses,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.140
so I had to come and see!

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.340
Where's Rui?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.540
He said he would be a bit late.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.820
Ms. Tan was free today,
so she came with me.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.980
You met her at the school last time.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.220
Ms. Tan,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.140
I heard you gave a lot

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.020
of suggestions for the wedding venue.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.700
Thank you.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.980
Don't mention it.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.180
We're old friends.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.020
Just helping out a little.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.260
Being abroad for many years,

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.260
she has excellent taste.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.740
Last time, she gave us

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.900
a lot of very useful suggestions.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.260
You're

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.740
so good to Yan.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.940
But you should also

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.740
think about your own future.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.460
Thank you.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.380
I still have plenty of time.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.820
No rush.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.660
Ms. Gao,

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.860
we've prepared the dress.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.140
Now that Ms. Wen is here,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.540
would you like her to try it on?

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.060
Of course.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.540
Come on, try it on.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.780
Alright, I'll go try it on.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.260
Please wait a moment.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.660
Okay.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.700
This way, please.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.660
Have you

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.380
found your dad?

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.780
It's

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.860
about two lives.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.420
Can't just easily

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.580
forget.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.700
They are about to get married.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.060
There's no need for me to tell you

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.820
about Rui's feelings for Yan.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.300
You've been around them so much,

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.260
so you should have seen it.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.460
It took Rui over a decade

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.140
to move on from your relationship.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.420
Now,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.060
everything is falling into place.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.020
If you have feelings for him,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.940
please don't disturb his life anymore.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.060
I really envy him

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.620
as you cared about him very much.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.180
If only Le had a mother too.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:19.980
Yan

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.820
will become a good mother.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.820
Of course, I know.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.100
She is such a good person.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.980
A stepmother
can't replace a real mother.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.140
Don't you agree?

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.620
Absolutely gorgeous.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.540
Ms. Gao, you have a discerning eye.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.500
This one is perfect for Ms. Wen.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.780
The most beautiful bride.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.020
Right, Ms. Tan?

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.420
Gorgeous.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.540
Hello.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:27.900
Okay.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:28.500
I got it.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.380
I'll be right there.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.820
This part can be adjusted.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.220
Ms. Wen, something urgent came up.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.220
Gotta go.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.300
Ms. Gao is here to help you
with the final decisions.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.060
You don't need me anymore.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.380
Okay. Thank you so much for today.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:39.900
No problem.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.780
I'm off now.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.300
Bye-bye.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.940
Goodbye.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.540
This one is truly gorgeous.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.940
Let me know if you need adjustments.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.420
Rui, I've finished trying on the dress.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.620
Everything went smoothly.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.860
If you're still busy,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.740
no need to rush over today.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.900
Excuse me.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:35.620
Could I

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.340
get a ride in your car?

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.420
I'm in a hurry to get to this place.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.060
Okay.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.020
Alright.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.420
Where are we going?

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:45.900
Here.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.580
Alright.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.220
Have you ever been to this place?

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:02.980
No.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.620
Sorry about that.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.540
It's okay.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.020
Do you want some water?

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.140
There's some in the drawer.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.660
No, thanks.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.940
Could you please drive a bit faster?

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.260
I'm in a big hurry.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.500
Alright.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.700
Are you okay?

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:40.620
I'm fine.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.180
Please step on it.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.020
Sorry.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.420
What's the rush for?

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.780
I have news about my dad.
