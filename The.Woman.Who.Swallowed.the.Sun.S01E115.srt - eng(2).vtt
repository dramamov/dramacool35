WEBVTT

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.210
You little punk...

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.280
Let go of me!

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.250
No!

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.290
Finish the job this time.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.690
If you mess this up,
he'll be a thorn in our side for good.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.060
So make sure you finish the job.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.660
Call me when it's done.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.830
That persistent little pest.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.900
Looks like this is
finally coming to an end.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.070
What are you planning to do
about Director Moon Tae Kyung?

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.680
I have to deal with him
one way or another.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.280
The nerve of him,
trying to get revenge on me.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.880
As if I'd let a guy like him
get the best of me.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.260
You guys...

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.630
will spend your whole lives
as Chairman Min Doo Sik's lapdogs,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.240
blindly following your master's orders,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.670
not even knowing what you're doing.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.610
Is this punk asking for more?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.980
Why?

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.150
Did he promise you a promotion
if you buried me?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.920
Or did he promise to wire you
enough money to last a lifetime?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.760
But you know what?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.030
You guys...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.300
are never going to see that money.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.330
You know why?

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.000
Because soon enough,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.700
you'll end up just like me.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.780
You're digging your own grave
with that mouth of yours.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.580
It doesn't matter
if it's today or tomorrow.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm destined to die by your hands anyway.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.520
The important thing is...

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.190
that after I'm gone,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.560
you guys will be next.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.170
That's ridiculous.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210
Why would the chairman want to kill us?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.670
You imbeciles...

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.440
If you kill me after murdering Jo Pil Doo,
you'll face aggravated charges.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.010
There's no getting out of that one.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.850
At the very least, it's life in prison.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.320
Worst case, it's the death penalty.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.220
We didn't kill Jo Pil Doo.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.390
I know. Chairman Min Doo Sik did.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.190
And that's why you're in even more danger.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.590
You're the only ones...

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.700
who know about that secret.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200
Then we'll just say
the chairman was the one...

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.030
who killed Jo Pil Doo first.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.400
How can you be so dense?

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.240
That's exactly why
Chairman Min Doo Sik is...

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.340
going to get rid of you.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.140
Do you still not get what I'm saying?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.980
Keeping alive the only witness
who knows about...

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.610
a vile crime that
must never see the light of day...

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.750
is like holding a ticking time bomb
in his own hands.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.520
Would you take that risk if you were him?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.150
If I were Chairman Min Doo Sik,
I'd never let you live either.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.890
Just you wait.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.630
After you're done with me,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.060
Chairman Min Doo Sik's other rats...

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.370
will do exactly what...

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.770
you are doing to me right now.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.150
The phone is turned off.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.520
You will be connected to voicemail.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.790
The chairman said
to take care of him immediately.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.990
But surely...

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.560
something awful
won't happen tonight, will it?

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.930
Please.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.200
Please, let him be okay...

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.270
Mi So.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.370
Please watch over him for me.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.010
Protect him. Please?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.430
I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.660
Not at all.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.700
I wanted to have a sleepover with you too.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.480
Come to think of it,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.620
I can't even remember
the last time we did this.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.490
You were always so busy.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.730
But you were always
my number one priority.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.730
Even when I was buried in work,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.900
not a day went by
that I didn't think of you.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.040
I know.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.970
Out of our whole family,
you're the one who worried about me...

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.210
and took care of me the most.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.120
No matter what anyone says,
you're precious to me.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.450
Don't you ever forget that.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.190
You think I don't know that?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.560
You're the most precious person to me too.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.870
You look so well-rested.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.410
You're glowing.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.740
As the kids say nowadays,
you look amazing.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.910
I know, right?

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.580
I was crammed into a single bed...

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.820
next to Se Ri,
who tossed and turned like crazy,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.020
and I had to sleep on my side
without moving a muscle.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.150
But for some reason, I feel so at peace.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.990
It just means you two were meant to be.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.360
That must be it, right?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.630
There must be a bond stronger than blood
for me to feel this way.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.270
Of course.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.700
It would've been nice
if you were her birth mother.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.840
But if you've raised her as your own,
then she is your daughter.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.980
I feel the same way.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.610
But I'm still...

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.480
a little curious about that woman.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.690
The one who was in the ambulance with you.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.560
Se Ri's birth mother.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.790
Why are you curious about her?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.860
I'm sure she's off living well somewhere.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.530
Don't waste your time thinking about her.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.870
Shall I get breakfast ready?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.870
You have to eat before you get going.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.840
No, it's okay.
I'm having brunch with Se Ri...

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.340
at the cafe where she works.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.710
You're going to go see her at work?

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.780
I'm curious.
I want to see how she's managing.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.180
I just hope
she isn't breaking all the glasses.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.720
Manager Gong, I'd like a coffee, too.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.720
What? You haven't left for work yet?

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.390
I'm going in this afternoon.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.490
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.430
Where is he? Look at the time.
Why isn't he at work yet?

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.730
He eats me alive
if I'm even ten minutes late.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.340
Seriously, Director Moon
has such a double standard.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.110
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.920
Look at this. He even turned off
his phone on purpose.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.950
Director Moon has been in his position
for way too long.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.190
Someone needs to knock him down a peg.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.500
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.580
What did you call me for?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.380
You have to help me.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.880
What are you talking about?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.880
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you have no right to ask for anything.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.620
Have you forgotten what you did to me?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.950
Honestly,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.420
I felt more betrayed by you
than I ever did by Min Kyung Chae.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.790
I mean,
Min Kyung Chae has always been like that.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.500
She and I were never in
a pure relationship,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.900
but we were different.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.170
We met when we were young
with no ulterior motives.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.340
But then you said
you'd choose Moon Tae Kyung over me.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.240
That you couldn't live without him.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.340
So why are you asking me for help?
Go ask your new man for help.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.810
He's...

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.810
been kidnapped.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.550
What?

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.020
By who?

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.260
Don't tell me it's Chairman Min.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.530
Please, you have to find out
where he is right now.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.000
If we're not careful,
his life could be in danger.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.100
Moon Tae Kyung's life is in danger?

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.940
Baek Sul Hee, you're unbelievably cruel.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.440
And you're asking me
to be the one to save him?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.940
You have plenty of informants
and people who can handle this.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.210
Forget it.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.850
I may not have much pride,
but even I wouldn't stoop that low.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.780
Save your own man.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.400
You don't listen, do you?
I told you never to come here again.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.200
Tae Kyung is in danger.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.070
He was dragged off somewhere last night
on Chairman Min's orders.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.580
I heard the chairman say "get rid of him,"
but there was nothing I could do.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.950
That's why I came to you.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.050
Min Doo Sik is a revolting man.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.120
How can he be so vile?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.250
Madam Jang, please help me.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.060
If anything happens to him, I can't go on.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.460
I already regret not protecting Mi So.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.330
If I lose him too,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.170
I'll have no reason to live.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.000
But what can I possibly do right now?

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.470
If we at least knew where he was taken
or the scene of the crime,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.740
we could check
the security footage nearby.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.150
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.550
What's going to happen to him?

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.350
All we can do is have faith
in Moon Tae Kyung right now.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.460
He's a tough man, inside and out,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.390
so he won't go down without a fight.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.910
Do you still need more time
to figure things out?

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.680
You’ve got something on your mind, too.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.520
That's why you haven't killed me yet,
right?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.190
- What are you talking about, you punk?
- Think carefully.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.890
You might get away
with kidnapping and assault,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.300
but murder is a different story.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.910
Yes, Chairman.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.620
How did it go?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.790
It's been handled as you ordered.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.920
Then send me a photo as proof.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.790
I'll pay the rest once I see it.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.530
A photo?

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.060
You thought I'd just take your word
and pay you?

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.200
But sir, all this time,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.300
we've done all your dirty work for you.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.400
Enough.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.570
Send me a photo
that proves you finished the job.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.020
He wants to know
if you took care of me properly,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.160
and he wants a photo as proof, doesn't he?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.860
And after that, you're next.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.660
He'll order someone to get rid of you
and demand a photo for proof.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.100
There are two ways to deal with someone
you share a secret with.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.470
You either remain loyal
to each other for life,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.710
or you just kill them.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.110
The Chairman Min Doo Sik
I know would probably...

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.750
choose the latter option.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.420
If you don't believe me,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.290
go to the chairman's office
at Mingang Distribution.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.230
The acting chairman, who is filling in
for Chairman Min Doo Sik while he's ill,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.230
will tell you everything.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.470
You have nothing to lose, anyway.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.810
Whether you get rid of me now
or after visiting the chairman's office,

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.510
what difference does it make?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.790
I don't even have the strength
to stand right now.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.460
I'm not going anywhere.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.970
(Mingang Distribution)

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.310
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.050
You seem to be in a much different mood.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.120
I take it you've made peace
with the situation regarding Se Ri.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.890
There's nothing to make peace with.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.090
She was my daughter from the start,
and she'll always be my daughter.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.730
But what brings you here?

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.100
I thought we were finished.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.640
The engagement ended the moment
you took off the ring.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.870
Oh, right.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.310
I guess we still have
a professional relationship, don't we?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.280
If you're here to talk business,
then get on with it.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.510
This may be the last personal conversation
we will ever have.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.520
He's been kidnapped
on your father's orders.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.460
What did you say?

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.190
Why would my father do that to him?

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.530
Thirty years ago,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.360
there was bad blood between the chairman
and Moon Tae Kyung's parents.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.430
Moon Tae Kyung found out about it
and came seeking revenge for his parents.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.100
The chairman figured out who he was.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.240
And the person who knows his true identity
and is helping him get his revenge...

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.150
is Lucia.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.420
Those two are already deeply involved.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.220
They even shamelessly claim to be in love.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.150
In love?

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.260
If their love grows any deeper...

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.430
How dare they deceive us
and pull a stunt like that?

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.260
Why are you just now telling me this?

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.860
Because I just found out myself.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.400
I knew they were close,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.370
but I had no idea they were in love.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040
Unbelievable!

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.710
Sir, I've told you repeatedly.
You can't go in!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.450
Darn it, I said we're going
to the chairman's office!

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.020
Sir, you can't just force
your way in like this.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.750
I'm going to have to call the police.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.660
Go ahead, call them.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.420
- You can't. What is wrong with you?
- What's with all the commotion?

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.630
What's going on?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.660
These men showed up
without an appointment...

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.600
and said they need to go
to the chairman's office.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.870
They said they have to see you.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240
Me?

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.970
Do I know you?

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.650
Moon Tae Kyung sent us.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.920
Is he really okay?

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.330
If he's already a lost cause
and you're just here putting on a show,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.290
I swear I will make you pay.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.700
If that were the case,
why would we even show up here?

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.700
We'd be on all the security cameras.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.200
So Moon Tae Kyung really sent you?

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.800
The chairman wants us
to take care of him...

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.070
is demanding photo evidence.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.920
How's Father doing?
You said you'd check on him today.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.320
He can talk now.
His legs are still partially paralyzed,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.430
but otherwise,
he's fine and can communicate.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.000
But it's still too soon
for him to be discharged?

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.930
I think so. Even if he came home,
he couldn't go into the office right away.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.570
Then that woman will have free rein
for a while.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.610
Your stepmother, I mean.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.410
Honey, you need to back the right horse.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.740
Don't waste time with the losing side.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.210
You think so?

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.680
Now that you mention it,
Director Moon must have a backer.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.980
He's been skipping work as he pleases.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.320
See? That proves he's on her side.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.220
Then we need to get back on her good side.
What should we do?

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.660
Should we talk to Soo Jung?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.130
What are you two doing in my room?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.000
Hey, what are you going to do now?

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.670
Lucia's running things now,
so what's your plan?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.940
Think about it. What if she gets greedy...

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.070
and decides to steal Father's shares
while he's in that state...

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.480
to take over the company?

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.280
So, you're saying
we should suck up to her?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.150
Gosh, you catch on quick.
Impressively quick.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.190
Your stepmother's about to be in charge.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.790
We need to make a good impression.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.160
You want to make a good impression
so you can take my job?

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.590
Weren't you two...

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.860
recently sucking up to Kyung Chae
for a director job she promised?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.930
Why are you bringing up that ugly past?

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.340
Hey, circumstances change,
and people change with them.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.970
That's right.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.410
I thought you didn't hold grudges,
unlike Kyung Chae.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.380
It's true, I don't hold grudges.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.880
But seeing you two now,
you two really are a perfect match.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.920
Us?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.250
Of course we are.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.490
People always say our marriage
should be studied by academics.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.590
They say arranged marriages
rarely work out so perfectly.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.730
Jealous?

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.900
Looks like he'll stay out again.
He didn't come home yesterday, either.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.540
I know. He's never done this before.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.340
Tae Kyung seems to be going off the rails.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.110
Going off the rails?
You're the one who said it.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.140
That working late and even staying out
are part of being a professional.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.410
But not for consecutive days.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.810
Confucius himself said,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.380
"You can eat 100 meals out,
but you should sleep in one bed."

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.080
Or was that my uncle?

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.090
Anyway, it's not good to sleep anywhere.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.720
For crying out loud.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.590
You're not actually worried
about Tae Kyung, are you?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.460
You're just worried he's going to skip out
on the rent, aren't you?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.800
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.530
I'm not heartless
when it comes to good people.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.670
Do I look like I'm obsessed with money?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.270
Yes, you do.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.140
However, I'm genuinely worried
that he's not back,

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.910
which means we're nothing alike.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.280
You're just worried
he will disappear without paying his rent.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.050
We've been married for far too long.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.010
Let's separate and live apart, all right?

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.320
At the very least,
let's sleep in separate rooms.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.150
I'm such a pure, innocent soul
that it even surprises me sometimes.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.590
"Pure," my foot.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.160
Do you think I don't know you're thrilled
that the shareholders' meeting failed...

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.830
after you secretly sold off
all your Mingang stake and played dumb?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.970
I can read you like an open book,
Oh Pan Sool.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.570
I told you I'd be a dog if I sold it!
I'd be Oh Pan Fool, not Oh Pan Sool.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.170
You've always been a dog.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.310
If you're married to a dog,
does that make you a dog wife?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.610
- A dog wife!
- A dog wife!

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.110
Why aren't you doing as you're told?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.320
I told you to send me a photo to confirm
you took care of Moon Tae Kyung.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.790
What?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.160
You want me to wait?
Who do you think you're telling to wait?

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.260
Are you out of your mind?
You've completely lost it!

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.390
You little punk...

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.170
I can't believe this.
How dare he hang up on me?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.670
The person you called is unavailable.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.610
Connecting to voicemail.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.270
I swear, these guys...

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.440
Is something the matter?

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.550
Those idiots aren't doing
what I told them.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.220
I clearly told them to send photo proof,
but they're ignoring me and stalling.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.350
- I'll wring their necks.
- Please, calm down.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.050
They must have their reasons.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.990
Those men would jump off a bridge
if you told them to.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.830
I doubt they would defy you
without a reason.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.160
Reason or not, when I give an order,
they shut up and obey.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.900
Actually, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.800
Can we really trust those men?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.470
Those pieces of trash.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.040
Without me,
they couldn't even make a living.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.910
I'm the one who took them in.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.350
But still, they're the ones
who do your dirty work.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.050
You shouldn't speak so harshly.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.780
I'm getting rid of them soon anyway.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.150
If I keep them around any longer,
they'll just become a liability.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.290
Those guys know too much.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.790
I have to shut them up for good.
What choice do I have?

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.330
What are you going to do?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.060
You're going to get rid of them, too?

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.430
I have to.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.170
I've already hired the people
to take care of them.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.720
Thirty years ago,

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.090
my parents were wrongly killed
by Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.400
The only witness
who knew the entire truth...

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.300
was Jo Pil Doo.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.270
If Chairman Min Doo Sik gets rid of me
after killing my father,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.480
he'll be the monster
who wiped out my entire family.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.320
He even eliminated the only legal witness.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.990
Don't pledge your loyalty
to a man like that.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.920
It will only lead to your own destruction.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.000
Then why hasn't she called yet?

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.630
She will.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.200
I know she will.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.870
She's not the type of person
to break a promise.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.140
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.510
I should send another team
to check on them.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.590
It's me.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.960
Head straight to the address I sent you,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.790
and check who's still breathing,
and who's not.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.600
Take plenty of backup.
Those guys are no pushovers.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.430
(Hyundaek Manpower)

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.820
Moon Tae Kyung,
you underestimated me, didn't you?

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.420
You'll find out what I'm capable of
when you're buried next to your father.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.200
I've done it all to build
Mingang Distribution.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.360
Your lives mean nothing to me.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.530
How dare you even think about
getting revenge on me?

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.510
The person you called is unavailable.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.210
Connecting to voicemail.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.450
It's me.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.480
Head straight to the address I sent you,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.420
and check who's still breathing,
and who's not.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.420
Take plenty of backup.
Those guys are no pushovers.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.630
I don't care if it gets bloody.
Just take them all out.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.350
Find them! Hurry!

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.690
They're not here!

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200
Darn it!

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.900
- Hey, find them!
- All of you, spread out and search!

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:33.970
- Yes, Boss!
- Let's move!

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.910
What?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.180
How could they have disappeared so fast?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.850
If you don't know, then who does?
Did they just vanish into thin air?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.650
Shut up and find them now!

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.950
Catch them by any means necessary
and get rid of them all!

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.140
Why aren't you picking up?
Where are you right now?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.980
And what about him?

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.650
Put him on the phone right now.
I need to at least hear his voice.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.820
Do you realize who just saved your lives?
Now put him on the phone!

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.290
Tae Kyung...

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120
Tae Kyung...

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.130
Tae Kyung.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.030
Tae Kyung!

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.900
Tae Kyung, stay with me!

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640
Tae Kyung...

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.610
Tae Kyung!

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.550
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.670
Hey, where are you?

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.570
Come home right now. I'm already here.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.770
I will never forgive you for this,
Min Doo Sik.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.480
Is that woman and Director Moon...

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.780
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.110
Don't stop there.
What about her and Director Moon?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.420
How could you do that
to another human being?

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.620
Weren't his parents enough?
Did you have to do that to him?

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.550
Why would you do that?

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.820
If you despise him this much,
why did you marry my father?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.960
Because it was the only way
I could get what I wanted.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.730
Get out right now!

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.830
