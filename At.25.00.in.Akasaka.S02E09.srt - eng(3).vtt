WEBVTT

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.750
The play is about to open.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.380
And my shoot is about to start.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.880
How about we go somewhere before all that?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.540
I'd love to.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.290
My father's novel...

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.080
is being adapted into a film at a studio in the UK.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.380
Really?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.580
He wants me to play the lead role.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.130
An international production...

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.880
That's incredible, isn't it?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.040
Yeah.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.880
Asami-san?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.500
It's okay, go ahead and get it.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.460
I'll go get us something to drink.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.960
Hello.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.500
Asami, are you busy right now?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.710
No, it's fine.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.880
Asami.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
Are you going to be in your father's movie?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.040
I haven't given him an answer yet.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380
I see.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.920
Mom, what do you think?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.380
So you still don't approve?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.630
I'm coming to Tokyo next week.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.880
Can you make some time for me?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.330
I'd really like to talk things over with you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.420
But...

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.170
Please.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.670
I want to see you.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.630
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 9)

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.210
Do you know why I haven't come to see you?

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.710
Cut.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.040
Okay, cut.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.380
Sorry.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.790
It's alright, don't worry about it.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.830
Sorry, everyone. Let's go again.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.130
Okay, let's reset.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.960
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.830
Excuse me.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.710
Because I didn't want to see you.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.500
I've always been terrified of you.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.380
I have no fond memories...
of this house.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.130
Asami.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.790
I've told you so many times.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.330
Don't show your teeth when you smile.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.960
There's nothing... nothing good to remember at all.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.920
Cut.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.080
Cut.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.330
Cut.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.330
Okay.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.830
Alright, okay.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.380
Next up is Yoko-san's close-up.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.330
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.040
Right.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.540
Alright, then...

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.960
"Do you know why I haven't come to see you?"

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.670
I want to see you.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.250
Asami?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.500
I'm busy. Can't you just call?

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.040
Sorry.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.170
"Because I didn't want to see you."

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.080
Because I didn't want to see you.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.750
How's it going?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.380
Is the shoot going well?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.460
Not exactly.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.580
What's wrong? Hit a wall?

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.040
I used to always worry about what others thought of me.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.500
But...

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.580
Before we started shooting, the director told me...

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.250
For this film, Hayama-san, please unleash
all of my own emotions,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.960
and just let them all out on set.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.790
If it were just about playing a character,
I think I'd be fine.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.250
But to unleash my own emotions...

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.790
What does that even mean?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.960
Your own emotions, huh?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.920
That might be a tough one for you, Hayama.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.880
Hey, what about Shirasaki?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.960
He's the type who just lays
all his emotions bare, isn't he?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.920
Why don't you learn from him?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.880
You should talk it over with Shirasaki.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.080
You two are a couple, aren't you?
And in the same line of work.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.670
I can't.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.670
Why not?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.540
Precisely because we're in the same profession.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.420
Shirasaki has his own work to focus on.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.460
Shirasaki.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.250
Yes?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.330
You need to show more.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.790
Until his big play is over,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.380
I don't want to burden him with my problems.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.830
Welcome home.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.250
I'm home.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.630
The smell of Asami-san...

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.790
It really is calming.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.130
It feels like it's been a while...

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.420
since we've been able to see each other like this.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.080
Yeah.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.460
This is nice.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.210
I love your curry, Asami-san.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.420
Thanks.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.710
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.290
Okay.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.580
By the way...

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.130
When does the film in the UK start shooting?

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.630
There's an eight-hour time difference.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:08.080
Guess it'll be hard to find time to call each other.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.880
I might not take the role.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.000
Huh?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.380
I don't think I can do a good job.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.000
Right now...

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.080
my current shoot isn't going well.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.130
Whenever I have a scene with my mother,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.380
I can't help but think of my own mom,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.210
and I just can't get it right.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.750
I read my dad's novel.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.080
The main character...

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.170
is just like him.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.880
If I take the offer,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.920
it would mean playing that man.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.210
I'm already struggling as it is.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.920
The thought of playing him...

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.130
Are you going to turn it down?

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.580
Maybe.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.500
You're feeling anxious, aren't you?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.170
Me too...

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.040
I've been so anxious.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.250
Asami-san.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.460
You're always so many steps ahead of me.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.460
I try so hard to catch up, but I never can.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.830
When will I ever...

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.080
be able to stand beside you as an equal?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.710
Will that day ever come?

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.830
What if the play bombs tomorrow,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.380
and I never get another offer?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.130
You're always moving forward, Asami-san.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.960
What will I do if you leave me behind again?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.460
That's not going to happen.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.460
How can you be so sure?

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.460
Because...

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.290
You just got an amazing offer,
didn't you, Asami-san?

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.330
A movie at an international studio.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.080
That's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
no matter how much you want it.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.920
It's such a great thing,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.580
and you're going to turn it down?

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.670
My mother probably wouldn't want me
to be in my father's movie anyway.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.250
But what do you want, Asami-san?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.750
If you really don't want to do it,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.920
then that's fine.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.380
But I can't help feeling that right now,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.540
you're just making excuses not to do it.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.170
That's not true.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.880
I've been...

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.210
thinking really hard about it.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.710
You're lying.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.540
Forget about what your mother wants, or your father,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.420
or your lack of confidence. Put all of it aside.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.330
Asami-san, what do you truly want to do?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.210
Who are you acting for?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.170
A little more that way.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.790
- Thanks.
- Right.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.210
Yeah, line it up with that.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.000
We'll shoot it like this.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.380
Yeah, that's good.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.830
Let's put it here, then.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.130
Just like that.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.630
Please.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.130
I know this is a huge inconvenience for everyone,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.830
but I'd like to do that last scene again.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.040
Come in.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.500
Alright, and we're rolling.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.960
Scene 95, shot 3, retake 1. Marker.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.460
And...

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.630
Action.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:34.540
Do you know why I haven't come to see you?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.170
Because I didn't want to see you.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.960
I've always been terrified of you.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.460
There are no good memories...
in this house.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.540
How convenient for you.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.170
To just forget everything you did to me
and move on.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.040
I want to forget, too.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.170
I want to forget everything from back then

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.920
and just live happily.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.750
But...

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.170
You were in pain too, weren't you, Mom?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.330
Even if they aren't good memories,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.670
as long as they happened between you and me, Mom,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.420
I don't want to forget them.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.250
I'm sorry...

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.790
I'm sorry...

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.040
Mom.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.380
Mom.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.170
Cut.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:21.880
Okay.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.330
- That's the one.
- Okay.

Hayama-san.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.250
Yes?

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.830
That was brilliant.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.830

About your father's film...

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.250
Have you decided what you're going to do about it?

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.580
Yeah.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.880
I see.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.540
I'll be going, then.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.210
Mom.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.580
I'll be home for a visit soon.
