[Episode 28]

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.930
She doesn't remember anything.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.130
She doesn't remember Li Hongqing.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.490
Like this,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.690
do you really think she'll ever be happy?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.770
Qianqing...

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.100
I remember now.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.740
I wanted to go with you...

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.880
outside the palace.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.060
We must never let Xiao Ying remember!

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.940
Madam,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.220
Xiao Ying has never seen you.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.260
No.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.500
No...

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.260
He's so smart.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.220
He's bound to pick up on some clue about me.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.290
We can't let Xiao Ying live.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.290
She has to die!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.220
Rest easy, Madam.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.780
She may not make it through.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.220
Xiao Ying couldn't kill him.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.610
Ling Xuefeng couldn't kill him.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.610
Why does he always slip away?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.380
Looks like I'll have to do it myself.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.570
Ever since he seized that little witch,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.540
Qianqing hasn't set foot in Xuanguang Hall.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.660
This son of mine

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.220
would toss me aside

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.940
for some lowborn woman!

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.850
His Highness must be busy with state affairs.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.410
Busy with what?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.690
If he spared even half a thought for proper duties,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.940
I wouldn't have to worry like this.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.010
These flowers

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.540
need trimming.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.450
You are right, Your Majesty.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.410
This is Rest Incense I've prepared myself.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.060
Your Majesty may find it useful these days.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.690
You've personally made incense for me?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.940
If I remember right,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.410
this is the first time in five years.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.490
I was disrespectful before.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.780
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.940
[Rest Incense]

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.540
Don't say that.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.730
Everyone in this palace knows

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.930
you are His Majesty's man

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.660
and that you are wary of Xuanguang Hall,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.930
so you keep your distance.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.540
I understand.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.290
Prince of Yuzhang's loyalty to His Majesty

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.930
far surpasses mine.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.580
I was narrow-minded before.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.290
Preceptor Du,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.930
why would you say that?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.930
His Highness has given his all to assist His Majesty.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.930
Now Great Qi stands secure,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.930
and His Majesty holds power firmly in hand.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.410
Yet His Highness chose to withdraw at his peak,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.610
indifferent to rank and reward,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.340
a true example to the realm.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.780
All of this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.020
is thanks to Your Majesty's kindness

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.050
and wise guidance.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.250
You may speak freely.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.850
About His Highness stepping back,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.220
what exactly did he do?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.810
So Your Majesty truly didn't know?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.850
Then I've overstepped by speaking out of turn.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.050
His Highness is so upright and selfless

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.020
that he's given both his royal seal and his command token to His Majesty.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.170
His loyalty is pure enough.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.250
I'm ashamed

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.100
by comparison.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.930
I shall take my leave.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.780
Ask Qianqing to see me!

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.730
At once!

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.700
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.370
So,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.250
you handed over your royal seal

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.050
and your command token

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.370
just like that?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.540
You decided this on your own

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.340
and couldn't even be bothered to tell me?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.660
Of course you would object.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.580
But I've already thought it through.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.370
As a prince,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.170
you feel nothing for the throne.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.540
And now, you've even handed over

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.850
your command token and seal?

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.770
If I don't lay these burdens down,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.940
where else

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.020
can I ever find true freedom?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.620
Qianqing...

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.580
how many times have I told you?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.700
Your brother,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.060
Xiao Huan,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.970
is extremely calculating.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.290
If you hand these over today,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.850
tomorrow could be the day we die!

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.330
I've already made up my mind.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.650
Beat me or punish me,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.530
whatever you wish.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.970
You ungrateful son!

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.770
Do you know what it has cost me to live to this day?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.970
The late Emperor

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.850
lavished all his affection on that shady woman of unknown origin.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.380
He even made her empress.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.380
When she died,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.330
he made her sickly son crown prince.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.170
Our Liu clan has served loyally for three generations,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.170
a house of high rank.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.700
How am I any worse than her?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.170
And you,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.850
how are you any worse than that sickly wretch?

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.970
What has gotten into you all?

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.730
Have you all gone mad?

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.460
Qianqing,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.060
Xiao Huan is not your brother.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.850
He's someone who could take your life at any moment,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.530
your enemy!

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.580
In all the prices you've paid,

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.210
does that include Ying?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.410
You...

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.940
You're talking nonsense again.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.380
Deep down, we both know

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.700
what really happened with that fire

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.820
at Luling Palace!

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.260
You were so harsh on my imperial brother

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.620
that the palace servants dared to abandon their posts,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.340
and that led to the fire.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.260
If not for you,

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.340
Ying would never have ended up like this!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.380
How dare you!

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.260
Why did the late empress suddenly die of a mysterious illness?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.650
Why was her son

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.620
born with cold poison?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.530
Mother,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.690
do you dare

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.380
look into these things?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.170
There is a limit to this kind of wild talk!

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.100
Mother,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.770
do you love Ying?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.500
And have you ever loved me?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.650
Do you think everything I've done

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.260
was to hurt you?

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.260
Maybe you did.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.260
But the day comes

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.770
when we can no longer be tools in your battles,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.500
you'll stop loving us, don't you?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.050
You...

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.530
Mother, you've spent your whole life

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.900
trapped in this palace.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.850
I don't want to repeat your fate.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.340
This palace

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.580
is nothing but a gilded cage.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.060
Have you ever

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.340
truly been happy here?

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.890
Ying included.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.980
She was completely innocent,

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.820
yet still got dragged in!

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.250
I've thought it through.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.100
Once Ying recovers,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.770
I'll take her away from here at once,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.340
back to Southern Chu.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.460
What's wrong?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.490
Nothing.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.460
Did you argue with your mother?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.820
She hit you?

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.940
News sure travels fast with you.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.820
Zhong Lin...

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.530
I'm in a bad mood,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.730
and my wound hurts.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.130
When I was little, I got beaten a lot too.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.770
And I was terribly afraid of pain.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.490
After enough beatings, I eventually got used to it.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.100
This is my own special salve.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.650
It works wonders!

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.180
It eases the pain right away.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.700
Zhong Lin,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.890
thank you

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.770
for staying by my side

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.260
when I was at my lowest.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.810
Don't worry.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.740
I've already made up my mind.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.620
I'll take you and Ying away from here.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.260
We'll travel the world together,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.620
free and unrestrained.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.980
Travel the world,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.740
free and unrestrained...

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.500
All right.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.260
We'll go together!

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.260
The Empress Dowager is here!

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.260
My dear Ying,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.260
what are you doing?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.260
Move aside!

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.100
You're blocking my sun.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.530
Ying,

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.860
look at me.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.100
Mother's here to see you.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.620
Mother?

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.500
Does "Mother" mean my mom?

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.500
Yes.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.260
You look so fierce.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.900
I don't want you as my mother.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.170
I like the fun, pretty Empress.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.900
I want her to be my mother.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.770
My brother likes her too.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.410
She even promised to cure me.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.020
I'll get better soon.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.140
She wants to treat you?

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.380
- Hongqing... - How could she cure anyone?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.930
She definitely doesn't mean well.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.980
You mustn't believe the Empress's lies.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:21.980
Ying,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.770
do me a favor, will you?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.410
Help me talk some sense into your brother.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.450
Tell him to take back his royal seal.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.450
All right?

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.380
Are you listening to me?

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.260
Help me persuade your brother to take back his seal.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.740
Do you understand?

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.050
Do you or don't you?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.100
Ying,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.020
I'm talking to you!

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.020
Do you understand?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.140
Listen to me!

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.620
Xiao Huan, save me!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.340
Ying...

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.260
Mother,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.170
what did you give Father to drink?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.020
What did you give Father to drink?

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.690
What are you talking about?

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.900
Ying?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.500
Your Majesty,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.770
time to take medicine.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.900
You...

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.410
What did you give Father to drink?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.690
Tell me...

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.900
Ying...

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.100
has she remembered everything?

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.260
We really can't let her remember.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.740
We can't let her remember!

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.690
Li...

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.640
Hong...

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.530
Qing...

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.650
Dear Hongqing...

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.100
I remember you now.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.900
Heavens above,

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.380
you're finally awake!

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.100
Where am I?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.100
This is Lujiao Village.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.930
When we went up the mountain to chop wood,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.490
we saw you hanging from a tree.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.100
You were barely breathing.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.820
So the two of us carried you back.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.580
The village physician said you wouldn't make it.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.340
Didn't expect you to be this hard to kill!

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.930
Was I unconscious?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.580
Yeah.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.490
How long was I out?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.820
About...

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.100
a full fifteen days!

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.450
That's right, fifteen days.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.210
Don't get up!

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.250
Just rest...

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.780
You just woke up.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.380
Your body's still too weak.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:44.620
What are you trying to do?

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.450
Please take me to Fenglai Pavilion.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.900
For saving my life,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.410
I'll see that you're well rewarded.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.010
But Li Hongqing is dead.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.380
- Even if the flower blooms... -Don't say that again!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.380
there's no one left to protect you.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.450
That day...

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.690
someone told me...

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.060
Hongqing was dead.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.650
No one would take me to see the flowers.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.010
He gave me a box...

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.100
Inside was some incense...

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.650
Was it Gold Incense?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.060
That scent was so familiar...

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.060
What did it smell like?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.100
Medicine...

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.380
It was some medicinal incense...

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:22.970
It was some medicinal incense...

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.210
Today, when Father was struck by that arrow,

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.010
he uttered some strange word.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.620
[Nanrong]

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.100
Is it really you?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.860
Your Majesty.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.100
It's rare to see you so distracted.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.250
What are you thinking about?

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.060
I was thinking

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.780
that once all this is over,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.140
I want to leave the palace with you

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.380
and roam the martial world again.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.900
Sounds good.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.620
Your Majesty's word is law.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.060
Why don't you

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.300
put it in writing as a vow?

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.060
All right.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.170
Then for my empress,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.730
I'll write a vow.

Your Majesty the Empress,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.300
there's news from Physician Li.

What news?

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.340
The man at Fayun Temple

is already improving.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.170
He should wake up very soon.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.450
Really?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.170
That's wonderful!

You should be by his side.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.620
There's a thousand-year lingzhi kept in the palace.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.210
It can strengthen one's vital energy.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.690
It's extremely effective for patients who have just woken up.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.340
Have Wufu bring it when you go.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.170
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.250

will you still remember your vow?

Of course I will.

Once we find the one behind it all,

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.170
you'd better keep your promise.

It's something my mother left me.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.100
She said if I was ever in danger,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.900
I could use this hairpin to seek help from the Lingbi Sect.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.340
The mighty Imperial Preceptor of Great Qi

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.410
would turn to the Lingbi Sect?

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.690
It seems

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.100

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.060

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.540
so this is no more than you deserve.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.210
Ms. Yan,

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.490
I'm old and plagued by illness.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.690
I only wish to go home soon.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.930
Such generous gifts,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.410
I'm really not worthy of them.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.860
Oh?

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.340
Compared with all the bribes

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.170
you've taken over the years,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.780
these hardly count as anything.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.900
Madam,

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.010
Ms. Yan,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.250
I've been framed!

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:48.620
I've been framed...

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.970
Your crimes are written out clearly right there.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.930
Did you really think your little schemes

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.100
could ever fool the Madam?

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.410
Guards!

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.450
Spare me, Madam!

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.060
Spare me, Madam!

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.930
Du Tingxin,

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.410
how dare you deal with palace staff without permission?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.010
Du Tingxin!

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.650
Du Tingxin!

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.580
Anyone else here

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.860
have something to say?

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.250
From now on,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.970
we will follow only you, Madam!

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.450
With absolute loyalty!

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.410
- With absolute loyalty! - With absolute loyalty!

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.900
Eunuch Li...

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.140
You've served in the palace a long time.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.410
Hearing that from you

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.650
puts my mind at ease.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.060
We've been short-handed all over the palace lately.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.450
I've already chosen new people to fill the gaps.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.730
Appoint them one by one

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.780
according to what's written there.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.060
Understood.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.450
Before long,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.820
Madam,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.620
you'll have both the harem and the court

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.930
in the palm of your hand.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.650
Ying, remember:

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.140
After you and your brother leave the palace,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.730
give this jade pendant to him.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.780
My brother's taking me out of the palace?

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.060
That's right.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.340
I hope you can both stay safe.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.060
Leaving this place

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.410
may be the best choice for you.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.490
I just hope

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.450
all of this is just my suspicions.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.540
Suspicions?

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.620
Suspicions about what?

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.300
Whether someone

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.900
who grew up with me

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.430
is really the culprit.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.100
The culprit behind that medicinal incense?

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:33.730
All right.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.730
Put this jade pendant away.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.410
Your brother isn't easy to handle.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.730
If I gave it to him myself,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.820
he'd pester me with a hundred questions.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.380
So I'm giving it to you instead.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.490
If you ever run into any danger,

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.540
go to Fenglai Pavilion for money

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.300
or for people,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:50.780
as much as you like.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.170
Ying,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.140
everything that's happened

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.620
is already in the past.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.760
I hope you and your brother

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.620
can both find happiness.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.210
I'm sorry...

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.900
I don't know why,

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.650
but I suddenly wanted to say that to you.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.210
Ying,

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.450
with your brother,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.060
hurry and leave this cold, lifeless place.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.210
I hope you will both be happy

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.300
and carefree.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.010
And you?

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.060
Won't you cure me?

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.730
It hurts you too much.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.340
Let's stop.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.820
Then what about Hongqing?

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.540
I'm so close to remembering him.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.060
I want the treatment...

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.410
I want the treatment...

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.860
I want to see Hongqing clearly!

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:22.930
I want the treatment...

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.210
I want the treatment!

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.140
Treat me now!

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.930
If you won't treat me,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.410
I'll treat myself!

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.170
Xiao Ying,

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.450
calm down!

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.410
I want to see Hongqing clearly...

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.490
I want to see Hongqing clearly!

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.580
I want the treatment...

I want to see Hongqing clearly...

how can you be so cruel?

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.340
Please spare our Ying.

Are you trying to kill her?

What are you talking about?

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.730
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.490
Stop torturing Ying.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.490
Your Majesty,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.930
I beg you.

Please let Ying go.
