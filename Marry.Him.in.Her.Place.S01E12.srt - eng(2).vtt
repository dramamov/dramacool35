Chief Song.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.115
Why?

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.552
What are you referring to?

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:29.392
Aren't we on the same side?

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.992
Do you really want to stand with me?

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:36.432
We're both sharp enough to know better.

00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:38.967
There's no point in pretending.

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:40.724
Tell me

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.845
why.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370
Your problem

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.120
is that you're impatient

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.111
and you act hastily.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.151
I'm not here to listen to nonsense.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.352
Tell me why!

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:02.712
Chief Song, do you remember
how I got that scar?

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:16.061
(Five years ago,
turning over a new leaf)

00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:18.311
Congratulations on your appointment,
Chief Song.

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:20.152
This is just a little something from me.

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:25.652
Leave him to me.

00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:36.311
So you're the guy
who smashed up his shop?

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:37.471
You're a crooked cop!

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:38.552
You...

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:41.031
He cursed me, not you.

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:42.112
Move aside.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.992
It's fine.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:52.924
Just admit it.

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:54.325
You'll suffer less.

00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:03.432
You must think you're invincible.

00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:06.211
All right.

00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:08.012
I'll play with you.

00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:11.312
Come on.

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:14.072
Let's see how long you can hold out.

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:56.992
So you were that mangy mutt back then.

00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:04.707
What will it take for you
to hand over the ledger?

00:04:06.272 --> 00:04:08.786
Chief Song,
you still don't get me, do you?

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:10.620
I don't want anything.

00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:13.142
I just want

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:16.072
to drag you down.

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:24.799
Lin Yun

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.951
is suspected of smuggling opium.

00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:28.471
Arrest him at once.

00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:29.574
Anyone who resists

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:31.255
will be shot on the spot.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.270
I dare you!

00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:49.391
You're as despicable as ever,

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:50.632
Chief Song.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.392
You couldn't beat me back then.

00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:56.220
And you still can't.

00:04:57.612 --> 00:04:58.732
Men.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.780
Take him away.

00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:06.352
Move it.

00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:12.192
Don't worry.

00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:19.924

It's been a long time

Trying to rough me up without proof?

00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:38.831
Aren't you worried I'll walk out of here

00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:41.512
and bring Chengyun Society's men
to settle the score?

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:45.752
Do you really think
you'll walk out alive?

00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:50.672
Then again, you're right.

00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:53.074
We do need

00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:55.555
to settle this score properly.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.574

you can still take me on?

ends up worse off.

Have you heard?

00:08:35.912 --> 00:08:38.551
The black market opium den got raided.
The province was alerted.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:41.686
Rumor has it Chief Song was behind it.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.046
No idea if it's true.

00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:45.926
Even Lin Yun was arrested last night.

00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:47.849
I wonder if it's connected.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.832
Word is today's press conference
will reveal a secret ledger.

00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:56.912
Looks like Rong City's about to change.

00:09:02.512 --> 00:09:03.271
There she is!

00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:06.111
Mrs. Lin, we heard you're going
to reveal a ledger.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.792
Is it related to the opium found again
in Rong City?

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:11.411
Is Chief Song the one behind everything?

00:09:11.412 --> 00:09:13.231
Why was your husband, Lin Yun, arrested?

00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:14.591
What is recorded in that ledger?

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:15.551
Can you make it public?

00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:17.151
What's really going on here?

00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:19.271
Is it true the ledger contains
opium trade records?

00:09:19.272 --> 00:09:19.911

00:09:19.912 --> 00:09:21.471
