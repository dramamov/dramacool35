=Episode 22=

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.350
Father,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.830
you took my dragon pearl.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.149
Are you trying to kill me?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.630
From now on,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.510
I'll hold onto your dragon pearl

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.110
and seal it.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.510
So you can cool off,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.949
get your head straight,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.870
and go marry Liluo.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.390
Moshang,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.029
you'd give up the throne

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.750
just for Feng Zhilou.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.470
Is it worth it?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.110
Someone

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.710
like you who only knows
how to use people

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.470
wouldn't understand

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.190
what's worth it.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.630
Right.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.150
I don't get love,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.630
and I don't need to.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.390
All I know

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.270
is Father chose me.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.190
That

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.710
is what really matters.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.070
Growing up,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.830
he always took your side

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.470
and ignored me.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.470
It felt like he was ripping out
my dragon scales.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.910
Now you finally feel

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.230
that kind of pain too.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.669
Miss,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.869
what's wrong?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.789
I don't know what's up with me.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.190
I'm just always tired.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.190
And I sleep badly,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.510
always dreaming.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.548
But when I wake up,

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.110
I forget everything.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.429
Everyone's sluggish year-round.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.070
Being sleepy is normal.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.670
You actually make sense.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.310
But the only one who's sleepy

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.309
year-round is you.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.710
One word.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.229
Lazy!

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.430
Hey!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.910
Miss, eat something.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.269
Since the Young Master's out,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.470
I'll take good care of you.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.429
This chicken leg smells amazing!

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.950
Come have one.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.230
Miss,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.750
why aren't you eating?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.389
I'm just not hungry.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.830
Not hungry?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.150
Want to walk around town?

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.910
Let's go!

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.270
Moshang's never suffered like this!

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.990
I have to save him!

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.389
Save him?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.349
You?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.470
With what?

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.749
Your big courage?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.830
Then what?

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.110
There's no way.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.670
This barrier was set by Father.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.909
You can't break it.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.750
Young Master,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.230
you've suffered.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.910
Good thing you're here.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.110
I need you two to handle something.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.709
Young Master, don't worry.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.349
I'd risk my life

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.749
to get you out!

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.870
Head to Wujing.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.910
Find Zhilou.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.230
I'm worried Nie Rongzhi
will mess with her.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.830
Look out for her for me.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.509
Young Master, really?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.469
You're still thinking about Miss Zhilou?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.190
I...

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.470
You talk too much.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.469
Young Master, don't worry.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.030
We won't fail you.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.790
Let's go!

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.830
Bai Lu.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.790
Don't let Zhilou worry about me.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.310
Got it.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.950
We'll keep it quiet.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.790
Young Master,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.070
you're on your own from here
in the sanctuary.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.309
Miss, does this look cute?

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.029
Does it sound nice?

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.990
So childish.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.429
Those pastries we bought were amazing!

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.909
Right?

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.830
- Come by my place and try some!
- Sure!

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.550
Xiaoyu,

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.869
take whatever you like.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.350
I'll buy it all for you.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.230
Why are you crying?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.270
You're still the same,
always tearing up.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.149
You should smile more.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.950
You look the best when you smile.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.950
I look great smiling too!

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.829
Miss,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.829
let's go listen

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.229
to some stories.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.989
Let's relax.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.549
Okay.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.990
Let's go then.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.629
Today's tale is a legend about a beast.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.429
I love stories about beasts!

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.390
Miss, listen!

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.390
Two humans marry.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.150
Their kid's human.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.110
But if a human marries a beast,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.949
and they're really together,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.509
their child

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.869
could be anything.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.509
Makes sense.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.430
So this beast, Man Yi,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.150
turned into human form.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.629
He became a handsome young guy.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.190
He walked in the fields

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.109
and met a village girl, Yun.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.229
Love at first sight,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.789
then second sight,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.990
and by the third, they decided to marry.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.989
Yun went home

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.590
and told her family

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.629
she wanted to marry Mr. Yi.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.830
Her family saw him.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.109
Handsome,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.549
polite,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.749
and well-spoken.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.509
So,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.509
they agreed.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.829
After their wedding night,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.829
Yun found herself pregnant.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.509
Then if she is pregnant,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.230
is the baby human or beast?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.789
When Yun became pregnant,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.869
her symptoms

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.309
weren't like ours.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.669
How so?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.070
Human mothers

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.469
usually deal

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.429
with nausea,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.630
throwing up,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.110
and cravings.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.469
But Yun's belly

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.710
kept

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.830
jumping.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.230
Thump.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.789
Thump!

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.910
Thump!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.029
Like something inside
was actually dancing.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.749
Dancing?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.749
Beasts lay eggs, and their young

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.190
hatch from them.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.789
Miss, what's wrong?

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.909
It's nothing like us.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.629
Tell me what it is when it's born!

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.790
Okay.

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:38.589
Even without us,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.948
Hunbao will look

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:41.269
after Miss Zhilou.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.910
Carrying a beast fetus

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.550
makes you feel awful every day.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.669
Sounds about right!

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.029
After all that thumping,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.149
a few days later...

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.189
Where's Feng Zhilou?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.510
Yun's family noticed something was off.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.309
It was...

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.230
What are you two doing here?

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.109
Well...

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.709
You tell them.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.349
Elder,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.029
why aren't you two in the sanctuary?

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.149
Why did you come here?

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.029
That's a good one.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.309
We're here to drag you back.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.230
Let's go.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.909
Hear that? They're dragging us...

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.390
No!

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.070
Miss.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.190
Miss, what's wrong?

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.150
Did you have a nightmare again?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.830
Miss, your belly...

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.150
Move!

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.869
Wait, I remember now.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.149
This is exactly
like that storyteller's tale.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.269
You're pregnant!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.390
Don't talk nonsense!

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.149
Pregnant or not,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.910
a physician can check.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.189
I am a physician.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.670
Why would I see one?

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.870
Go to bed now.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.669
Miss,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.829
if you end up giving me
a dragon child to play with,

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.469
I'll finally have connections!

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.990
I'd finally have some pull
around the sanctuary!

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.470
Say that again,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.309
and I'll...

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.909
Okay! Just sleep!

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.950
I'm leaving!

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.430
With things like this,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.750
how am I

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.030
supposed to hold on until your wedding?

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.710
Mother,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.469
even though the prince

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.750
called off our engagement in public,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.269
the sanctuary sent word saying

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.190
they'll send me the battle robe
in three days.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.030
So,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
you want me dead right now?

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.790
Mother,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.869
I'm not going to push you that far.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.270
In this whole city,

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.869
there isn't a single decent person

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.430
who can walk me down the aisle.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.750
If we want to keep you alive,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.829
catching Yue or Feng Zhilou

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.429
is our best chance.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.110
Where's your brother?

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.270
He won't send you off?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.470
My brother?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.150
He's still alive?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.790
He might as well be dead.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.029
He already knows

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.429
what we did to Yue and Feng Zhilou.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.990
Now,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.310
he hates us to the bone.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.230
If he doesn't expose us at my wedding,

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.470
I'll count myself lucky.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.790
I planned for years,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.270
set everything up

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.710
so you'd have a future here
in Wujing City.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.350
Didn't think

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.190
you'd ruin it this badly!

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.869
You really...

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.030
You really are useless!

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.190
I'm telling you this

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.790
because I still see you as my mother,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.950
not so you can lecture me.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.830
You're pregnant.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.550
Mother!

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.309
When I was pregnant,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.830
I was just like this.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.189
Qingfeng was so annoying.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.350
He kept asking who the father was.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.630
And the elder wouldn't stop nagging.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.470
Only Qingyun was sweet,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.790
always making me tonics.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.350
Mother,

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.230
do you miss Feng Manor?

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.910
Of course.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.470
Out of all Wujing City,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.150
Feng Manor was always my favorite.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.350
Maybe because

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.590
the ancient Wujing Saintess

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.950
was born there.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.990
Maybe.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.630
Or maybe because

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.270
I dreamed of Qingfeng last night.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.070
He told me

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.710
it's time to wake up.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.950
Mother,

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.510
actually,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.910
I've been wanting to ask you
a lot of things.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.990
Back then,

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.950
why did you come to Wujing City alone?

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.710
Why

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.550
did you leave me behind at Feng Manor?

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.030
Who am I?

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.069
What does being

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.830
the Wujing Saintess mean?

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.990
What about the baby's father?

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.390
Is he good to you?

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.150
How's his family?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.830
Yes.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.430
Mother,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.910
he's really good.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.270
He's the kind of guy

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.630
who looks

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.350
grumpy on the outside.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.230
Cold, even.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.390
But deep down,

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.430
he's incredibly kind.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.350
He always sticks up for the weak.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.830
He took me,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.990
someone everyone called useless,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.270
and helped me grow stronger.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.030
He always protects my pride.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.990
And he's always on my side.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.990
Silly girl.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.870
Alright.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.350
He does sound great.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.430
Where is he now?

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.830
He...

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.909
Right now,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.030
he's dealing with something important.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.230
But I know

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.950
he's thinking about us.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.190
Feng Manor,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.830
Feng Qingfeng...

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.590
Qingfeng

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.710
really thought ahead.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.430
Back then,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.350
he didn't want you to feel burdened.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.029
He held you as a baby every day.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.550
Murmuring to you,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.910
"Little one,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.550
I wish you were just an ordinary child,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.070
so you could stay here in Feng Manor

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.910
and be happy

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.910
for the rest of your life."

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.470
Feng Manor,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.270
Qingfeng...

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.630
I really miss them.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.510
Zhilou, you there?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.549
I did everything I could.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.189
I don't think you'll see more clearly

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.510
than this.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.270
It's fine.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.750
This is how it should be.

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:26.390
Young Lord,

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:29.590
any news from the sanctuary?

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.190
Even if there is,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.470
Mother would tell Liluo, not me.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.030
Zhilou,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.910
I didn't call you here today
to treat my eyes.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.550
I called you to give you this.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.390
This book was protected
by every Wujing City Lord.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.110
It's our greatest treasure.
