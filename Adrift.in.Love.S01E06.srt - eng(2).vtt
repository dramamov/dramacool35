Who let you take Shu Juan's stuff?

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.695
I...

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.568
Why are you taking Shu Juan's things?

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:30.572
I warned you not to enter this room alone.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.498
Zhan Qian Ren!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.003
Let's see how long
you'll keep Shu Juan's things.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.883
Let's see how long
you'll keep Shu Juan's things!

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.216
You can tell me to wear her clothes.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.643
But you can't look at me

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.439
and see Shu Juan,
instead of me, Zhou Xiao Qi.

[Episode 6: Are these tears of love I shed?]

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.762
Have some first.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.925
Hey, listen.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.219
I met Gu Hou Ze today.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.855
I got to meet my idol and talk to him.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.101
Too bad Xiao Qi wasn't in a good mood today.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:26.104
Otherwise, I would've asked
for his autograph and a photo.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.773
- I'm so jealous...
- Wait, Miss.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.441
We've only been together for less than a month.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.068
And you're already talking about other men?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.444
Is that right?

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:36.246
Maybe we might not last
three months because of you!

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:44.372
I'm just admiring my idol.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.166
It's different.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.967
To me...

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.137
all men are the same.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.184
Cut.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.852
Are you filming a movie?

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.688
You're blinding everyone.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.273
Get a room.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.282
I'll go change.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:20.116
How is it? Is the food good?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.035
Ugh, I need to start looking for a new hire.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.212
The lady boss is off work,
and the boss has to go home, too.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.345
The staff can't eat.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.112
Fucking hell!

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.649
Can I go up later?

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.027
What are you planning?

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.397
What's on your mind?

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.651
I just want to go up and say hi to your mom.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.611
Are you sure?

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.737
Yes.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.245
Okay.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.043
Mom.

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:06.204
Mom.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.997
- What's wrong with my mom?
- Miss, are you her family?

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:08.999
I'm her daughter.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.333
Someone found her unconscious in the stairwell.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.709
She was unconscious when we got there.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.844
We're taking her to the hospital now.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.015
Get in first.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.478
We found multiple cancer cells

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.647
that had metastasized
to your mom's liver and lungs.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.899
Also, due to the shock,

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.110
her kidneys have deteriorated significantly.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.237
Her prognosis is not optimistic.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.246
How could this happen so suddenly?

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.783
Your mom's condition was already very severe.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.494
She was just holding on.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:49.372
She also said that
she didn't want to be intubated.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.166
She also signed a DNR.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.044
There's very little we can do.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.179
You need to be prepared.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:02.601
How much time does she have?

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.893
If there's anything she wants to say or do,

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.153
make good use of your time.

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:30.049
It'll be okay.

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:33.356
Why did this happen?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.094
All right, don't overthink it.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:17.428
In my room, there's a bankbook in my drawer.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.797
It's for you.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.216
It's not a lot of money.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.593
- It's really not much.
- I don't want to hear that.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.221
It's really not much.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.973
But I managed not to spend it.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.150
Thoughtful, right?

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.937
I don't want to hear that.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.907
The ATM card PIN is your birthday.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.164
Don't you dare cry.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.204
I told you not to cry.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.589
I'm not dying yet.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.303
Come here, let me ask you something.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.014
You know...

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.811
On your wedding day,

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:14.441
when you're in a wedding dress,

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.487
are you going to cry like this?

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.441
Please don't, okay?

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.033
Oh dear.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.954
Come here, let me hug you.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.750
Come here, let me hug you.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.639
If you miss me,

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:52.604
just light a cigarette
and get a Boston Cream Pie.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.518
Just burn more joss paper for me.

00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:01.105
Yes, you can spend that money however you want.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:03.532
You don't have to get married.

00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:08.112
Just treat yourself well.

00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:09.788
Okay?

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.093
All my life...

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.097
I've been a failure.

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.351
But what I'm best at...

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.192
what I'm best at is...

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:48.452
It's giving birth to a daughter like you.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.261
You'll look beautiful in a wedding dress.

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.003
I shouldn't have done that yesterday.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.874
It's okay.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.842
It was a misunderstanding.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.183
You were right.

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.895
I should have let go of the past.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.535
I'm sorry.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.621
Please forgive me.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.166
Okay.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.051
Here's what I promised before we got married.
[1 billion yuan]

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.515
Please forgive me.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.698
I don't think online results are reliable.

00:10:57.698 --> 00:11:01.543
Let's go to a few bridal shops
with the best reviews.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.665
I'm afraid it'll take too long.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.758
I just need to find a wedding dress
as soon as possible.

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:10.711
I don't think so.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.463
Even if we're not really getting married,

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:15.098
I want your mom to see you at your best.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:19.227
I'll look for it with you.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.413
I've moved you into a new family registry.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.624
The documents I borrowed
from you are all in there.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.217
Have a seat.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.263
I've made you a cup of coffee.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.862
Well...

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:15.151
Can I take a few days off
starting from tomorrow?

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.868
What's the matter?

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.488
My mom's condition has worsened.

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.706
She's not in a good condition.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.787
Take care of your mom for a few days.

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:29.339
You can come back when she's better.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.460
Thank you.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.719
Let me know if you need anything.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.218
Can I ask you about wedding dresses?

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:43.679
You're a newlywed, so you have more experience.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.355
Wedding dresses?

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.987
If you don't mind that I've worn it before,

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.857
you can have this.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.610
No, this is your wedding dress.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.779
Just recommend a few bridal shops to me.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.454
Do you like it?

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.413
Yes.

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.539
That's great.

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:12.333
There's no point in keeping it.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.752
But don't you want to keep it for the memories?

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.546
Weddings and wedding dresses
are just a formality.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.764
There's nothing to commemorate.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.142
It doesn't matter if
your wedding is real or fake.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.467
I hope any woman in a wedding dress

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:37.240
will be the most beautiful and blissful.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.246
Thank you.

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:48.043
Show me.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.923
- I see it.
- What do you see?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.468
This is the heartbeat. Do you see it?

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.053
I see it.

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:08.639
The child's quite active.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.525
Here.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.399
Considering the mother's age and yours,

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.985
I suggest we do an amniocentesis.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.403
Thank you, Wu.

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.454
It's no trouble at all.

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:36.417
This is the consent form
for a DNA paternity test.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.211
Please sign here. Thank you.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.887
Paternity test?

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:44.550
I'm getting old.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.893
I can't be with you forever.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.763
What if something happens to you?

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:51.307
With this certificate,

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.581
it's better for you and the baby.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.855
When I did the amniocentesis just now,

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.482
I did the test as well.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:04.494
Zhan Qian Ren has taken blood,
but we need your signature.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.866
Next week,

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.161
once the paternity test
and amniocentesis results are out,

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.954
I'll report them to you.

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.289
Let's have tea then.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.508
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:52.381
[Zhou Xiao Qi]

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.999
Why are you dressed like that?

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.751
It's weird to have a bride and no groom.

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.336
Besides, I'm the star.

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.012
How can I be absent?

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.507
I bet you forgot to prepare this.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.350
I've prepared it for you.

00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:05.281
Let's go.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.911
Shall we?

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.379
Yeah.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:23.466
I'm a little nervous.

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:27.011
Me, too.

00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:55.350
Mom.

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:59.118
Do I look good?

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.616
Damn it.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:21.000
My daughter is so pretty.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.131
Damn it.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.302
I'm your daughter, of course I'm pretty.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.524
Let's all look pretty today.

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:53.533
Let me tell you a secret.

00:19:57.821 --> 00:20:00.456
I'm sorry.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:06.337
It's my first time being a mom.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.966
I wasn't good at it.

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:17.390
It's okay.

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:22.603
It's my first time being a daughter, too.

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:31.521
Even if I could redo things,

00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:34.032
I don't think I can do it again.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.369
You're better at it.

00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:42.832
I'll still be your daughter in my next life.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.662
Mm.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.254
Mm.

00:20:56.129 --> 00:21:00.259
You promised not to cry
even when I'm in a wedding dress.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.893
Don't cry.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.025
Okay.

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.987
I've finished the hospital paperwork.

00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:46.365
I've also contacted the funeral home.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.583
They'll send someone to handle matters soon.

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:09.152
At least, your mom was content when she passed.

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:37.215
It's okay.

00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:46.849
I'll always be by your side.

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.662
Hou Ze.

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:18.623
What I did must have been very hard for you.

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:22.002
I was devastated when you didn't
come to New Zealand.

00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.879
I met a senior from my past.

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:24.914
He took good care of me.

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:28.758
I thought I could forget you.

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.677
But I was wrong.

00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.429
Please come.

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:34.514
I'm in so much pain.

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:39.068
If this goes on,
I really don't know what I'll do.

00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:50.044
Zhan Qian Ren asked the ob-gyn
to do a paternity test.

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.041
The results will be out next week.

00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.625
Let's go.

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.252
Let's go to a place where no one knows us.

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.595
Let's live in peace.

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:09.807
How can we live in peace?

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:12.761
He won't forgive me.

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:13.762
Neither will the loan sharks.

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:18.232
Instead of worrying here,
why don't we just leave?

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:24.123
If we don't, he'll know the baby isn't his.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.463
You're here again, slacking off.

00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:43.083
Qian Xiao An.

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:46.878
Everyone knows you became
Hongfa's Vice President because of me.

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:50.465
If you don't do your job well,
you'll embarrass me.

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:52.425
What do you mean?

00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:53.843
Listen up.

00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:55.052
I work the hardest, okay?

00:25:55.052 --> 00:25:56.085
I have to put up with them every day.

00:25:56.085 --> 00:25:57.847
You don't know how hard it is for me.

00:25:57.847 --> 00:26:01.233
Relax. Don't be so calculative.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:06.064
Sis.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.524
Reporting.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.241
Look.

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:14.281
My goodness.

00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:17.242
He's sneaking around.

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.494
Seriously.

00:26:19.494 --> 00:26:23.297
This is too much. Preposterous.

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:29.921
What's going on?

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:33.265
Not only did you fool around,
but you even took wedding photos.

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:40.189
Xin Tong's mom passed away.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.235
It was to fulfill her last wish.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.740
Are you saying the wedding photos are fake?

00:26:52.527 --> 00:26:54.548
Yes, the photos are fake.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:57.365
But my feelings for Xin Tong are real.

00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:59.909
Tell Tony to delete the photos now.

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:01.870
Don't let others get the wrong idea.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.539
How important is this photo?

00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:05.749
Is it more important than your son's feelings?

00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:09.135
It doesn't matter as long as
you're not really married.

00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:15.307
Xin Tong and I aren't getting married yet.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.595
But my feelings for her are real.

00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:20.716
I want to be a proper couple with her.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.899
I will treat our relationship right.

00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:32.158
Let me know when you've
made it past three months.

00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:06.726
Mister.

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:10.821
Don't go. Don't go.

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:22.082
Can you not throw your things around?

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.287
You're so pitiful.

00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:28.589
So pitiful.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:58.744
Mom.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:03.366
Can you wash your socks
and underwear separately?

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:05.994
It's easier that way.

00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:09.581
They're clean anyway, and I'm wearing them.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:12.375
I've told you many times that they're dirty.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.127
They're not dirty.

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:17.088
Please, I've trimmed
my fingernails and toenails.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:18.840
Look, I can even feed Zhao Qiang
these fingernails.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.425
Here.

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:23.394
Zhao Qiang is growing so well. Organic.

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:27.307
You should take it easy in life.

00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:28.892
Why tire yourself out?

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:31.527
No one lives as carelessly as you.

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.276
We won!

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.369
We hit the jackpot!

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:42.955
We hit the jackpot!

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.242
We hit the jackpot!

00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:48.877
Pan Xin Tong!

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.625
I can finally give my daughter a good life.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.043
I finally...

00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.127
So, I don't have to work?

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:58.012
You don't need to work.

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.092
50 million.

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:06.061
You can be a princess.

00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:09.224
My dream.

00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:11.400
This is from last issue.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.817
Damn it.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:21.236
Last issue.

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:24.204
I want a cold beer. Do you?

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:28.459
Damn, we don't even have beer.
I'll go buy some.

00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:55.562
We get a lot of vitamins from millet extract

00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:57.480
grown through small-scale farming.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.065
It's not just for moisturizing.

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:01.150
It also improves daily allergies.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.599
That's all for our proposal.

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:15.214
Okay.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.042
I'll send the details to Sam.

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:19.878
You'll be in charge of the meeting.

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.645
I'm sorry, everyone. I have to go.

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:24.632
Good luck.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:26.343
Vice President Xin.

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:30.763
Your last negotiation with the farmers
in the south went well.

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:33.349
Changing personnel
at the last minute isn't great.

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:35.184
You should go yourself.

00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:37.395
Since the proposal has been approved,

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:40.023
you'd better settle the collaboration details
as soon as possible.

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:42.533
Don't let others get ahead of you.

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:47.113
I think you should go to the south today.

00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:49.331
But I'm busy today.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:57.464
You're the one who swore
this project would succeed.

00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:01.385
Let's postpone other matters for now.

00:32:18.053 --> 00:32:20.605
[Have a sudden business trip.
Can't spend time with you.]

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.827
[I'm setting off. Call me if you need to.]

00:32:23.827 --> 00:32:26.464
[Don't feel too lonely and sad.
I'll be back soon.]

00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:48.341
You two, let's take another set.

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:50.309
Something more lovey-dovey, okay?

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.762
Okay.

00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.354
Okay, come on.

00:33:00.728 --> 00:33:01.813
Okay.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.482
- Thank you for your time today.
- Thank you.

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:06.859
The content is so exciting,
even I'm really looking forward to it.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:08.611
- Thank you for your hard work.
- No problem.

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:10.446
I'll walk you out.

00:33:10.446 --> 00:33:11.823
Okay, thank you.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.415
This way.

00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:15.709
Bye.

00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.310
- Take care.
- Thank you.

00:33:42.228 --> 00:33:44.610
- Mr. Zhan Qian Ren?
- Yes, that's me.

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.037
Please sign for this.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.170
Thank you.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.552
[Zhou Xiao Qi: Mr. Zhan is still at home.
Come get me later.]

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:14.812
[Wait for my message.]

00:34:14.812 --> 00:34:18.654
[Okay, I'm nearby.]

00:34:18.654 --> 00:34:19.964
[Read]

00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.926
Let's hang out when he comes back.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.685
Sure.

00:35:09.023 --> 00:35:10.991
I'm still at the clinic.

00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.486
Okay, I'll call you back.

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:16.038
Okay, bye.

00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:21.828
- Which game are you playing?
- What do you think?

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:24.882
Tell me. Which game are you playing?

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:33.172
Aren't you going to the office?

00:35:33.172 --> 00:35:35.182
Don't you have a meeting?

00:35:36.175 --> 00:35:37.760
Do you want some coffee?

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.763
The driver went to the airport
to pick up an American client.

00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:43.523
He'll be back to pick me up later.

00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:52.824
How are your counseling sessions?

00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:56.654
It's been fine. Why do you ask?

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.322
I'm just curious.

00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:03.119
How does that handsome
psychiatrist conduct his sessions?

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.170
What do you talk about?

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.791
When you see a psychiatrist,
you talk about psychological matters.

00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:09.792
It's boring.

00:36:09.792 --> 00:36:11.752
Is it?

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:15.924
But in my opinion, it's not boring at all.

00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.216
Okay, I'll call you back.

00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:20.143
Okay, bye.

00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:26.350
Are you going for counseling,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.443
or meeting a lover?

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.900
We'll talk about this later.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.318
Tell me this first.

00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:38.161
Is the baby in your belly mine?

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:40.865
You're not going to tell me?

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.283
It's fine.

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.911
I'll find out once the paternity test
results are out in two days.

00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:48.797
I'll ask you again. Is the baby mine?

00:37:02.803 --> 00:37:04.396
No.

00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.556
You planned this, didn't you?

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:43.351
Yes. What do you want?

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.974
I'm so good to you.

00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:50.851
How can you repay me like this?

00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:52.353
I'm sorry.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:53.771
I'm sorry.

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.899
You've ruined my last hope in life.

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:59.110
What's the use of saying sorry?

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.028
I'm sorry, just let me be.

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:03.163
- Let me be.
- Darn it! Come back!

Darn it!

Medicine...

Mr. Zhang, can I help you?

00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:21.734
I'm sorry. I lost my wallet.

00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:23.361
Maybe I dropped it during the interview.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:26.072
Can I come in and look for it?

00:39:26.072 --> 00:39:28.282
Give me a minute. I'll help you look for it.

00:39:28.282 --> 00:39:30.041
Okay, thank you.

00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:51.389
Your wallet.

Ma'am.

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:58.396
I wonder if I can schedule
a solo interview with you next time.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.232
Sure, just make an appointment
with my company's secretary.

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.109
Okay, no problem. Thank you.

00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:04.743
Bye.

00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:32.054
Call the center for me.

The patient is unconscious.

We used a non-rebreather mask,
but the blood oxygen isn't coming up.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.934
We're using an Ambu bag now.

I'm taking good care of myself.

Family, please wait outside.

Are you Mr. Zhan Qian Ren's family?

00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:41.642
- Are you Mr. Zhan Qian Ren's family?
- That's me.

00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:42.977
How are you related to the patient?

00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:44.311
I'm his wife.

This is the consent form. Please sign it.

You won't listen to me no matter
how many times I tell you.

Next time, I won't...

Next time, I won't help you clean up.

How's my husband's condition?

Dr. Fan is putting in a stent.
He's in critical condition.

Why did you turn off your phone?

00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:46.160
I rushed back from the south
in case something happened to you.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.244
But you've just been at home.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:50.372
I rang the doorbell for so long.
Why didn't you open the door?

This is my home.

It's none of your business.

My mom is dead.

I did the same thing when my dad passed away.

You left me alone.

00:47:06.114 --> 00:47:07.741
These days, it feels like
