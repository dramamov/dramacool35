00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.120
Chief, hurry and go!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.720
Rui Yu

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.240
Rui Yu

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.040
Go!

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.480
Rui Yu

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.440
Hold on a little longer.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.800
Rui Yu

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.160
Rui Yu, wake up!

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.240
I brought medicine to stop the bleeding.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.320
You gave it to me.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.720
The best medicine.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.880
You’ll be fine, I promise.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.400
Hang in there.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.400
There’s a city ahead.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.960
We’ll have a place to rest soon.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.000
I’m sorry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.080
You’ve been through so much.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.400
It’s me.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.840
I’m the one who slowed you down.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.120
Don’t say such nonsense.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.560
If you hadn’t shielded me from that blade,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.440
I’m afraid I...

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
I trust you.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.480
You’ll definitely save me.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.000
Let’s go.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.080
Why did you call me out so early?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.160
Your two younger brothers have been gone for months.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.040
They should’ve been back by now.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.080
Go ask around.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.560
Maybe something delayed them.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.520
Delayed by what?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.480
They’re adults now.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.080
I’m not worried, so why are you?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.600
Look,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.440
the messenger is back, isn’t he?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.360
Honestly...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.600
Bad fox.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.480
It’s fine now.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.640
What happened?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.760
Where’s Rui Yu?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.680
We were ambushed by bandits disguised as raiders.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.320
Rui Yu and I

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.600
got separated.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.360
What?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.080
Let’s talk inside.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.120
Sister-in-law,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.760
please make some calming soup.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.240
Alright, quickly!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.920
Let’s go inside and talk.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.440
Come.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.480
What exactly happened?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.520
Tell us quickly.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.280
We were scattered by the raiders.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.680
We went in two directions.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.960
I escorted the princess straight to Su Zhou City.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.000
Rui Yu and Nan

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.760
Chenxiao went the other way

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.760
to draw the raiders away.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.560
The opposite direction from Su Zhou City.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.720
So they headed toward Qiemo City.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.400
Yes.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.720
And with the raiders chasing them,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.240
they couldn’t turn back.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.040
So they had to keep heading north.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.240
From Qiemo City

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.400
enter Ling An’s gate.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.680
Qiemo

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.240
is independent from Ling An.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.240
Qian Yuan

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.040
Pingxiang

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.480
outside the three kingdoms.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.800
They’re not friendly to people from the three kingdoms.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.960
And all their luggage is on the carriage.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.240
They don’t have any identity documents with them.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.960
You have so many connections.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.880
Send someone to Qiemo City to find them!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.920
Most of my people are in big cities like Qian Yuan and Pingxiang.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.680
But small cities like Qiemo...

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.920
I really

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.480
don’t have a way.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.000
For now,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.640
we can only ask Your Majesty for help.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.200
No.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.960
This matter is too complicated.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.280
Don’t alert Your Majesty for now.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.560
But...

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.720
I do know a few jewel merchants.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.960
Maybe they can get us into

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
Qiemo City.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.240
Really?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.920
That’s wonderful, then.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.080
Rui Yu

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.520
Rui Yu

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.480
You’re awake.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.920
We...

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.200
Where are we?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400
This is Qiemo City.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.280
Don’t worry.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.440
It’s very safe here.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.440
Those raiders won’t come after us anymore.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.640
Young Master Nan,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.160
the medicine you wanted—

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.440
I got it for you.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.640
Your wife is awake.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.240
You are...

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.040
Come.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.920
Careful.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.880
I am Yang Ping.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.000
A good friend of Young Master Nan.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.720
During our days in Qiemo,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.600
Yang Ping took great care of us.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.240
Thank you so much.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.120
It was nothing.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.440
Compared to this,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.600
Young Master Nan helped us a lot more.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.760
That’s a huge difference.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.040
Lady Nan,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.200
you were unconscious and knew nothing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.800
A few days ago,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.720
Young Master Nan showed wisdom and courage.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.720
He helped Qiemo through a crisis.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.040
He’s our great benefactor.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.600
Chenxiao,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400
why are you out here?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.640
You’ve just recovered from serious injuries.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.320
You still need plenty of rest.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.400
I’ve been lying down for so many days.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.080
I’m a bit tired of it.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.840
I wanted to come out and see the scenery.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.280
Come, sit.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.280
Be careful.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.400
I asked Yang Ping

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.520
to find this book for you.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.320
It records all of Qiemo’s

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.800
landforms.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.800
Thank you.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.800
No need to be so polite.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.080
Yang Ping’s wife made this for you.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.360
If you like it,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.560
you can wear it.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.560
They’ve cared for us so many days.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.320
We should send them a gift in return.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.160
Wait here for me, then.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.560
I’ll go buy some things.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.720
to give to them.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.520
Alright.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.280
Night patrols are well organized now.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.360
The townsfolk

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.880
are much more at ease.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.120
I'm grateful you listened to an outsider like me.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.640
During the Ghost Weeping,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.200
you set aside old customs

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.520
and increased patrols.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.840
To survive,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.440
we must adapt, after all.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.760
Qiemo City sits at the border of three nations,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.840
yet stands outside their rule.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.720
It's a no-man's land.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.520
None of them can be relied on.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360
We don't want to

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.600
just wait for doom.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.000
What's wrong, Young Master Nan?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.440
Your rattan armor—

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.520
did it come from the fallen Yunluo Ancient Kingdom?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.800
Was it passed down from there?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.240
Qiemo City gets intense sunlight.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.400
Iron armor is heavy and cumbersome.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.600
It's not suited for battle.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.000
So this rattan armor

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.360
was crafted by our ancestors

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.760
after returning from Yunluo Ancient Kingdom.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.960
Is there something wrong with it?

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.720
I've been pondering a question these days.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.640
Yunluo Ancient Kingdom is a misty, rainy region.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.680
Rattan armor works well there.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.040
But Qiemo is hot,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.240
and water is scarce.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120
It's highly flammable.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.000
This rattan armor

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.920
could be a liability.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.760
What should we do about that?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.200
Military texts once recorded

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.960
if rattan armor

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.400
is soaked in tung oil for two days,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.960
tung oil itself resists water and corrosion.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.760
Rattan armor soaked in tung oil

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.440
becomes tougher.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.880
It can withstand blades and spears.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.720
But if there's a big fire,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.560
it's still at risk of burning.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.040
If fish scale plates

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280
are sewn onto the outer layer,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.880
making fish scale rattan armor,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.680
then it would be fireproof.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.400
Fish—

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.920
fish scale plates.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.480
Is there a problem?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.040
No, not at all.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.640
Thank you, Young Master Nan.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.280
Young Master Nan.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.200
Mi Na.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.160
What brings you here?

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.080
Young Master Nan,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.000
Miss Rui is waiting for you by the river.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.480
Alright.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.200
Let's head out first.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.080
Well then—

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.440
Young Master Nan,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.000
You've worked hard washing so late.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.600
Come with me to dry clothes by the river.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.160
Sure.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.840
Yu'er.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.240
From tonight, the dew is white;

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.520
the moon of my homeland is brightest of all.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.120
The ancients

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.080
always used moonlight to express longing.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.440
I never felt it before,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120
but tonight,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.800
I truly understand.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.480
What's wrong?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.200
I—

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.120
I'll never let you be in danger again.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.000
I trust you.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.600
This afternoon,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.640
I learned to make clothes with Mi Na and the others.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.760
I tried all afternoon, but nothing turned out right.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.320
Before I go home,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.560
I'll buy you a few more.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.040
Let me see.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.200
I think this is just fine.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.680
Really?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.840
Really.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.920
What are you thinking about?

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.080
I'm thinking—

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.000
about what was mentioned earlier,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.120
the fish scale plates.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.320
When I said they improve fire resistance,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.240
Yang Ping seemed troubled.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.120
But he wouldn't say why.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.440
So I didn't press him.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.040
Qiemo City

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.040
is independent from Ling An,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.240
Pingxiang,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.120
and Qian Yuan—those three nations.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.560
Though it's not

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.720
controlled by any of them,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.080
it's still restricted.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.840
They can't trade with the three nations.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.840
Nor can they increase their forces.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.280
So,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.560
fish scale plates are

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.160
extremely rare for them.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.800
I see.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.440
Before,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.600
I thought Qiemo was just a small nation

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.440
with its own way of life.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.920
But now,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.560
I understand.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.760
Qiemo often suffers from bandit attacks.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.360
We can't just stand by.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.360
When I return,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.880
I'll report to Your Majesty.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.360
Maybe

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.240
we can open a trade route.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.400
Really?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.800
That would be best.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.120
But the fish scale plates needed—

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.320
there are so many.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.120
We can't gather them

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.120
all at once.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.760
Second Brother's business

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.040
often goes to Jiangnan.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.600
It shouldn't be a problem.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.880
Trust me.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.200
This way,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.880
Qiemo's crisis can be solved.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.360
My sister told me

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.560
during the days I was gravely injured and unconscious,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.000
Qiemo City accused you of poisoning.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.560
They made things difficult for you.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.360
You had to serve and work.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.040
Those bandits

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.600
weren't just after us—

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.200
they targeted Qiemo City too.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.960
Luckily, the danger passed.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.480
While I was unconscious,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.200
for some reason,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.560
I could only

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.800
hear your voice speaking to me.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.880
Since the day you were hurt,

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.320
three days have passed.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.920
I thought we'd be out of options.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.320
But by sheer luck,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.080
we found Qiemo City.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.360
We're almost there.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.000
I have lived my life with no regrets.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.520
I only regret not having the chance

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.200
to spend my life by your side.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.040
If I could,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.200
I wish I had never brought you here.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.720
Then you wouldn't have faced danger.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.920
I'd rather be the one lying here.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.840
When you wake up,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.920
we'll return to Ling An.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.040
I'll stay by your side,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.760
and go nowhere else.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.640
Once I take revenge,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.440
I'll follow you wherever you go.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.160
If you die,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.440
I will not live alone.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.480
When we were in danger by the river,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.760
I don't know how I found such courage.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.960
I rushed over in that instant,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.400
lying right before your eyes.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.920
Thinking back now,

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.920
I realize I'm just like you.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.040
I'd rather suffer myself

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.160
than let you be hurt at all.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.240
If I die,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.200
you will not live alone.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.200
I feel the same way.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.120
Rui Yu.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.560
What I promised you,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.480
I will never break my word.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.760
Trust me.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.080
In a few days,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.600
we can finally go home.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.600
It will take time to gather all the fish scales.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.560
I've already arranged everything.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.040
Soak the rattan armor in tung oil.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.600
Once the fish scales arrive,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.240
we'll make fish scale rattan armor.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.880
Then we'll be completely safe.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.080
Qiemo City is a vital stronghold.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.320
It must be well defended.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.560
Young Master Nan is right.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.120
Yang Ping will remember this.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.160
Your great kindness to Qiemo City

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.440
will be remembered by all its people.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.720
They will never forget it.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.760
In the future,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.080
you will always be honored guests here.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.400
If you ever need anything,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.440
Yang Ping

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.000
will follow you to the end.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.960
We already have the map.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.200
You don't need to escort us further.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.680
Before we came,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.600
the city lord instructed me

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.280
to see you safely to Ling An City.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.400
But

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.080
the people of the city

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.320
are truly reluctant to see you go.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.440
The two of us

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.280
are deeply moved by their kindness.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.480
But we've been away from home for months.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.520
We must return home to let them know we're safe.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.520
So,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.960
will you come back again?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.920
You are a city guard.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.000
You should understand

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.360
that the bustle of life

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.040
is not in parting,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.960
but in meeting again.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.520
If fate allows,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.200
we will meet again.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.120
Lady Nan is right.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640
Open the city gates.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.920
Please, after you.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:57.840
Hyah!

00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.760
Hyah!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.000
Hyah!

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:02.880
Hyah!

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.720
Hyah!

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.240
Hyah!

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.640
Rui Wang!

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.520
Chenxiao!

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.760
Rui Yu!

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.000
I'm so glad you're both safe.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.360
Now I can relax.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.960
Wait,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.520
what did you just call me?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.840
After all this time apart,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.440
you didn't even call me Second Brother.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.720
That really makes me sad.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.560
Here we go again.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.640
Why are you here?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.280
Let's talk about it later.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.360
Right now, there's something

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.240
even more urgent.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.680
What is it?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.240
Eldest Brother is here too.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.560
But he can't ride a horse.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.600
He arrived just after me.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.960
But it's only a short while apart.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.720
You two,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.240
go find a place over there

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.160
and change your clothes.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.680
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.920
Let's hurry and change.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.600
You keep Eldest Brother calm.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.640
Let's go, let's go.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.480
So glad to be reunited.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.880
During this time,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.920
there have been many sighs.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.600
This general from Qiemo City

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.240
is now our family guard.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.160
Isn't that a bit odd?

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.640
And

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.880
why does he keep watching us?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Just ignore him.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.320
He won't leave

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.240
anytime soon.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.280
Once Second Brother handles the documents,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280
he'll send him back.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.200
I'm done with this.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.480
I'd rather die than keep doing this.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.360
What's going on?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.400
Since Eldest Brother took over the Pingxiang timber trade,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.520
this keeps happening.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.640
Let's go take a look.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.920
Is it proper for me to go too?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.840
Why not?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.080
Father is shouting and furious.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.920
We should let Eldest Brother save face.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.560
You're still not used to this?

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.640
Let's go.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.880
Just kill me, just kill me.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.960
I'll kill you!

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.120
I'll kill you!

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160
Father!

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.320
Father! Father, Father!

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.000
Father!

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.240
If you have something to say, say it calmly.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.760
He is still the eldest in the family.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.200
You...

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.920
Show him some respect.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.160
You all leave first.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.800
Father.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.200
Don't be angry, calm down.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.360
I'll kill you!

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.560
Lord Rui

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.240
Aren't you going in?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.920
Listening here is enough.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Just treat it as watching the fun.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.000
Lord Rui, always so composed,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.680
is even joking now.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.560
Times are changing.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.280
Did I say something wrong?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.120
If you can't use idioms,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.360
then speak less.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.240
What did I say wrong?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.040
What is going on here?

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.320
Let him explain himself.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.680
It's the second and third brothers

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.720
who found me a job.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.440
I said no, but they insisted.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.720
I'm exhausted.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.480
Aren't you the one who loves this stuff?

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.480
Now you get to do it.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.080
Why aren't you happy about it?

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.640
Do you know how much wood needs handling?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.240
According to the higher-ups,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.160
the wood must be processed well,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.400
then designs made,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.440
then carved out,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.720
and finally counted.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.880
Then sent to each country.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.800
Even a donkey isn't as tired as me.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.440
You suffer but get no respect.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.200
It's a task from Your Majesty.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.200
Only two days in and you're complaining.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.520
No ambition at all.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.480
Besides, you're not working alone.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.000
There are so many skilled craftsmen.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.120
You're just overseeing them.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.720
And you can't handle it.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.240
No ambition.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.640
When a hobby

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.440
becomes a career,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.280
your passion slowly fades.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.480
Once someone loses

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.360
what reason is left?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.720
Didn't you promise not to get physical?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.160
Why are you throwing things again?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.440
Honestly...

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.760
Husband,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.680
in all of Ling An City,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.440
no one suits this job better than you.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.120
You know the goods,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.320
and have the skills.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.920
Once the alliance trade is settled,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.640
Your Majesty will make you an official.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.520
How glorious for your family!

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.520
Where was I?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.400
The passion in your heart

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.680
will slowly fade away.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.840
Once someone loses passion,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.680
they become like a walking corpse.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.000
What use are you to this family?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.800
Lady Nan,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.760
Yes, beat him!

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.040
Lady Nan, Lady Nan!

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.080
You’re really something!

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.480
You're just asking for trouble.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.440
Feeling itchy, huh?

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.040
Come here!

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.600
Stand there, stand still!

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.400
What's going on?

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.240
This...

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.280
Lady Nan,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:33.720
Come back!

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.960
Don't hit me, I get it!

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.800
Wait till I beat you!

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.160
This situation...

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.000
It's not right for us to come again.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
Looks like the house will be lively for a while.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.640
Yeah.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.640
No idea where Second Brother went.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.520
Haven't seen him in a while.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.440
Let's go back to Taoran Courtyard.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.120
Alright.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.680
Today we received a secret letter from Chongming.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.840
The Pingxiang envoy

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.960
has passed safely.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.760
With the state-sealed national letter

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.720
and returned to report.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.080
With this,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.280
the trade agreement between the two countries

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.600
is now fully settled.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.960
Second Brother has bought the first batch of fish scale rattan armor.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.160
Eldest Brother found a trusted gem merchant.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.920
Once the fish scale armor is made,

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.280
it can be sent as "jewelry"

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.720
and secretly delivered to Qiemo.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.680
Thank you.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.720
Your Majesty.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.440
What other tasks did you get?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.880
Secretly assist Second Brother

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.640
and monitor the officials in the capital.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.160
They call it leading the Chongming Guard,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.880
but thinking about it,

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.600
it feels like Second Brother is just using me.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.200
And it's not even official.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.640
But you can finally serve the country.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.560
Congratulations, Young Master Nan.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.040
It's all thanks to Lord Rui's support.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.080
Only then could I

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.840
try my hand at this.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.760
Brother Rui,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:56.920
over here.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.440
General Qiao and General Qian

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.680
were taken away by the Ministry of Justice.
