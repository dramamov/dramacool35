00:02:58.305 --> 00:02:59.185
Are you hungry?

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:00.505
No.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.745
But I am.

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:04.295
Let's go.

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:15.605
Wait.

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:17.725
Hold it.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:19.585
The lighting there is really good.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.945
You can draw?

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:28.705
I kind of can,

00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.145
but it's been a while.

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:32.905
You've got so many skills, don't you?

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:36.865
When I was young,
my mom taught me how to draw.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:40.105
But since she passed away,
I haven't done any artwork.

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:44.745
I still can't believe
both of my parents are gone.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.545
It feels kind of weird when it hits me.

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:56.425
How exactly?

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.785
It's like there's a void
inside my heart.

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:04.145
It's bottomless.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.905
It's a reminder that

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:10.185
from now on, I'm truly alone.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.185
Here. It's done.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:35.345
Whoa...

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:37.905
You're amazing.

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:40.545
Here.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:43.865
It's my turn.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:45.705
You know how to draw, too?

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:47.985
No, it's my first time.

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:55.465
I'm the first one you've done
all sorts of things with, right?

00:04:57.965 --> 00:04:58.775
Too much.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:10.025
Do you have to look
that nervous while sketching?

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:12.865
Well, it's my first time.

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:14.185
Be patient with me, okay?

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:16.905
Take it easy.

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:19.145
Don't worry about it.
It'll turn out just fine.

Here.

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:34.705
Promise me that you won't laugh.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:35.465
Mm.

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:47.905
Hey, you promised.

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:51.985
Well, it's...

00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:54.065
It's pretty good for your first time.

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:57.905

You might be upset
because of what I said,

00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:09.665
but I don't want to lie to myself.

00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:13.225
In the end, what will happen is

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:14.545

What? If someone
wants to pick up the goods,

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.265
you'll be able to tell them where it is.

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:11.215
You're not giving this
to Kae anymore?

She works in the kitchen now?

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.625
Yeah. She didn't tell you that?

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:25.665
Maybe she can handle seeing
what caused her pain.

00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:39.065
I'm kidding, by the way.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.465

Do you need my help?

00:09:05.605 --> 00:09:06.505
It's okay.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:08.545
Just stopping by is enough.

00:09:21.025 --> 00:09:23.065
Hey, hey, hey! Look!

00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:25.505
They're holding hands, too.

00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:26.585
They're so sweet, aren't they?

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:28.175
How adorable.

00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:31.265
Look at them.

00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:35.465
You can't hide here, okay?

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:39.505
I chose to work here,

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.705
so we can talk business more easily.

00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:55.705
Right...

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:57.825
I can even see it from miles away.

00:09:58.025 --> 00:10:00.065
Don't use our business as an excuse.

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:01.955
What's the plan?

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:06.745
Do you want Duen and Karakade
to deal with her?

00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:10.385
No need.

00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:14.065
By the way,

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.185

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:18.705

00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:22.985
Don't worry about it.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:25.825
I'm working on it.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:30.705
This table.

00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:45.145
It feels weird, doesn't it?

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:49.385
In a good way or a bad way?

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.265
In a good way, of course.

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:54.905
It's like it's just the two of us
in this world.

00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:17.145
Claire.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.385
There are too many people here.

00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:21.665
Don't mess around.

00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:27.135
Stop teasing.

00:11:29.165 --> 00:11:30.065
Dig in!

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:34.425
You said

it's just the two of us, didn't you?

00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:58.145
Claire,

00:11:59.325 --> 00:12:00.625
this is the canteen.

00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:01.575
So many people here.

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:07.305
♫Just tell me that you like me♫

00:12:07.345 --> 00:12:09.345

♫Tell me if you love me or not♫

00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:19.065

00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:23.785
♫'Cause I'm waiting, you see♫

I love it.

00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:34.065
It's alright.

00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:35.065
Right? This is great.

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:36.545
It's stunning.

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:38.265
Can you delete the video?

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:40.905
Is there a problem?

00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:42.865
I was in the video.

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:45.625
Come on, you weren't even the focus.

00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:48.305
Please. I feel uncomfortable about it.

00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:55.305
Just do it for her.

00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:03.065
Thank you.

00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:05.665
Let's do another take.

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.905
Ready? One, two, three!

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.425
The loan amount looks very good.

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.665
The number of inmates taking loans
has gone up by almost 20%.

00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:30.345
That's great.

00:13:30.385 --> 00:13:31.585
Should we split the cut now?

00:13:33.185 --> 00:13:34.185
Not now.

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:36.745
We still don't have enough money.

00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:40.185
What? But you said we grew by 20%.

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.945
- Where's the money?
- Yeah.

00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:43.465
Well...

00:13:44.185 --> 00:13:45.625
It's in circulation.

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:49.945
In circulation?

00:13:51.305 --> 00:13:52.425
What the hell does that mean?

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.545
I still don't get what 20% means.

00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:57.785
To put it simply...

00:13:58.025 --> 00:14:01.425
I use a portion of the money
to encourage inmates to take loans.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:02.905
That's the initial investment.

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:04.345
It's separate from everything else.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.225
Another portion goes to those
who borrowed money from us.

00:14:07.585 --> 00:14:09.865
What we get monthly
in return is the interest,

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:13.105
which they pay with either their wages
or money sent by their relatives.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:14.945
Once we receive the money,

00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:16.425
we split it.

00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:18.945
Why don't we just take the money
from them now?

00:14:19.785 --> 00:14:20.705
Yeah, she has a point.

00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:23.145
It's not worth it right now.

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:24.825
Say, if you lend 100 baht
to your friend,

00:14:24.985 --> 00:14:26.385
that's the amount
you'll get back right now.

00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:28.265
However, if we wait a month,

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:29.665
what we'll get instead is 120 baht.

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:31.105
Now, multiply that by a year.

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:32.265
How much will we get instead?

00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:36.985
Money's rolling in, huh?

00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.185
What are you doing?

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:39.225
- Dao!
- Sit down!

00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:46.105
If I hadn't forced Mangpor
to tell the truth,

00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:47.905
I'd have been clueless for ages.

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:49.985
How dare you two do this to me?

00:14:51.785 --> 00:14:53.985
Dao, I'm sorry.

00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:55.865
I've been wanting to tell you,

00:14:55.985 --> 00:14:58.585
but I don't want Wichai
to get a share.

00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:02.665
Kae manipulated you, didn't she?

00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:06.425
Get back all of the stuff

00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:07.705
and return the money to them.

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:10.145
Cancel the loan, too, got it?!

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:12.785
It can't be done.

00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:16.105
Why?

00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:18.665
It's my money.

00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.545
I'm the one making the calls.

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.145
D*mn, Kae...

00:15:22.385 --> 00:15:24.945
You're getting a bit headstrong,
aren't you?

00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:26.385
Duen!

00:15:26.745 --> 00:15:27.545
Get her!

00:15:33.805 --> 00:15:34.665
What?

00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:37.105
You're disobeying me now?

00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:41.345
You're trying
to overthrow me, aren't you?

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:45.145
Dao, don't read too much into this.

00:15:45.185 --> 00:15:47.305
We're just running a business.

00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:49.185
You can just do your thing.

00:15:58.305 --> 00:15:59.705
I'm going to tell this to Wichai.

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:02.825
We'll see
how far you can keep this up.

00:16:04.585 --> 00:16:05.905
You wouldn't do that.

00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:07.575
And if you do,

00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:10.145
I'll expose
what you've been doing with Wichai.

00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:13.625
Deedee...

00:16:16.065 --> 00:16:18.065
Duen and I are doing well.

00:16:18.505 --> 00:16:19.905
Please don't get in our way.

00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:37.505
I'm in trouble again.

00:16:58.545 --> 00:17:00.185
I just sent you the money, didn't I?

00:17:01.025 --> 00:17:02.305
It's not about that.

00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:04.985
I need your help.

00:17:06.265 --> 00:17:07.145
What is it?

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:08.735
I've got some news,

00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:12.065
and I want you to spread it.

00:17:13.225 --> 00:17:14.225
What news?

00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:18.225
The accused, who stabbed
the victim with scissors to death,

00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:21.385
was highly audacious and cruel.

00:17:21.425 --> 00:17:25.185
The victim was a teacher
loved by her students.

00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:26.945
They are now devastated.

00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:29.255
Is it true that the murderer

00:17:29.277 --> 00:17:31.147
stabbed the victim
19 times with scissors?

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.265
Natty.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:35.585
Time for a meal.

00:17:52.825 --> 00:17:54.425
Let's do some grafting today.

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:56.625
It's so that
we don't have to get more seeds.

00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:01.705
Alright.

00:18:03.345 --> 00:18:04.345
Okay...

00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:05.705
Here's the first step.

00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:09.065
Find a mature branch, not too old

00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:10.665
or too young.

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:12.025
This one should do.

00:18:12.665 --> 00:18:13.505
Here.

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:19.865
Oh...

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:24.705
Next, cut in an area of the bark.

00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:26.745
Just cut the bark out, right?

00:18:27.345 --> 00:18:28.065
Mm.

00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.105
At the top, cut just under the node.

00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:31.425
At the bottom,
cut right above the node.

00:18:31.665 --> 00:18:33.385
Oh, okay.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:37.705
You got it.

00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:41.745
Ow!

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:43.305
You're bleeding.

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:44.345
Are you hurt?

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.705
An ant sting hurts more.

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:49.345
It'll get better soon.

00:18:49.385 --> 00:18:50.345
Let's go see the nurse.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:54.345
She'll find excuses,
and we won't get to borrow a knife.

00:18:55.405 --> 00:18:56.405
We don't need to see her.

00:18:58.065 --> 00:18:59.065
Are we not going?

00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:08.625
Poof!

00:19:11.225 --> 00:19:12.945
Do you think I'm that young?

00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:16.505
When I was young,
when I got an injury,

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.145
this is what my mom would do.

00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:20.345
The pain actually went away, too.

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:23.395
No wonder

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:24.985

don't work with my sisters.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.825
Without you,
they can't run their business.

00:20:20.865 --> 00:20:21.745
Got it?

00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:24.505
Dao, hey...

00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:25.645
Why the f*ck are you touching me?!

00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:28.505
The split you earn

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:31.905
comes from inmates
taking out loans to buy the goods.

00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:34.305
I don't f*cking care
about any of that.

If you don't listen to me,

00:20:35.785 --> 00:20:36.955
I'll tell Wichai,

from outside again.

00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:39.565

to do the job instead of me.

What you're doing right now

is threatening

This year, the sales of products
produced by the inmates

00:27:56.225 --> 00:27:59.105
have increased by nearly 10%, sir.

00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:00.825
So I think

00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:03.745
it's time to introduce
a greater variety of goods

00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:06.185
to provide them
with more options, sir.

00:28:09.985 --> 00:28:11.865
We'll go over that later.

00:28:12.945 --> 00:28:14.305
Someone reported that,

00:28:15.185 --> 00:28:16.505
here in this prison,

00:28:16.785 --> 00:28:18.425
there was some confusion.

What do you mean by that, sir?

Yes, sir.

And her cause of death?

00:28:34.585 --> 00:28:35.785
It was due to heart failure, sir.

I have the autopsy report
from the hospital here.

there must be
some misunderstanding, sir.

00:29:00.985 --> 00:29:03.745
Several reports had been made
to the Department of Corrections,

was likely due to an overdose

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:11.385
because of Alzheimer's.

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:13.225
I think the intention of the reports

00:29:13.265 --> 00:29:15.545
must be to tarnish
the reputation of this prison, sir.

00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:01.105
The Department of Corrections
contacted me.

00:30:01.145 --> 00:30:02.585
All I did was provide them with info.

00:30:03.665 --> 00:30:05.305
What did you tell them?

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.825
I told them that

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:11.305
inmate Porn had Alzheimer's,

00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:13.745
which could lead her
to overdose and die.

00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:14.785
Porsches!

00:30:17.345 --> 00:30:18.545
You aren't a doctor.

00:30:18.665 --> 00:30:19.825
You're just a guard.

00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:22.025
Giving false information like that...

00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:23.505
Do you know how troubled I'd be?

00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:26.045
The false information is about
the cause of death,

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.504
stated as heart failure.

00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:34.625
How did you know
if it's true or false?

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:36.425
Before inmate Porn
returned to her cell,

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:39.265
I found her empty medicine bottle.

00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:40.865
I asked the nurse

00:30:41.185 --> 00:30:43.345
and found out that
it was for her antihypertensive.

00:30:43.385 --> 00:30:45.665
Everything
that inmate Claire said is true.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:47.825
Inmate Porn

00:30:48.225 --> 00:30:49.945
overdosed and died.

00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:51.305
Porsches!

00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:55.505
What are you trying to do?

00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:57.145
I was just saying the truth.

00:30:58.705 --> 00:30:59.705
Gosh, Porsches...

00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:01.305
What were you thinking?!

00:31:01.345 --> 00:31:02.705
I just think that...

00:31:02.905 --> 00:31:04.765
If this were to happen to me,

00:31:05.265 --> 00:31:07.985
I would want everybody
to know the truth,

00:31:08.265 --> 00:31:11.145
not a twisted version from someone
trying to cover up their mistakes.

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:24.225
My dear father and son...

00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:27.625
How's it going, working as a guard?

00:31:29.105 --> 00:31:30.145
It's going great.

00:31:30.185 --> 00:31:31.825
I've discovered
so many untold things.

00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:44.055
Hm?

00:31:46.065 --> 00:31:46.985
It's nothing.

00:31:47.025 --> 00:31:48.105
Have some fruits, then.

00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:49.225
Thanks.

00:32:31.025 --> 00:32:31.865
Whoa!

00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:36.305
You came out of nowhere.

00:32:37.245 --> 00:32:38.145
So soft.

00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:41.225
What soft?

00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:44.585
The bras, of course.

00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:46.825
See?

00:32:49.145 --> 00:32:50.145
Teasing me?

00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:53.985
I like you.

00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:54.905
That's why I teased you.

00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:58.305
I want to hang my clothes!

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:04.745
I want to do my laundry
like they do!

00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:10.385
Gosh...

00:33:28.305 --> 00:33:29.825
Are you heading outside, dear?

00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:38.585
We'd like to talk with you
for a minute.

00:33:42.665 --> 00:33:44.585
I received a call from your university,

00:33:45.665 --> 00:33:47.665
saying that you've been absent
from several classes.

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:51.425
Is something wrong, honey?

00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:52.465
I'm fine, Mom,

00:33:53.545 --> 00:33:54.545
like always.

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:57.785
If there's something on your mind,

00:33:59.025 --> 00:34:01.105
feel free to share it with us.

00:34:10.665 --> 00:34:12.825
Do you think
I have something on my mind?

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:17.385
If it's about your sister,

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:20.465
I don't want this to stress you out.

00:34:21.385 --> 00:34:23.265
Everybody has their own paths.

00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:25.825
She sees the world
differently from you.

00:34:26.945 --> 00:34:28.665
If that's how she chooses to live,

00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:29.865
then that's where she'll end up.

00:34:29.905 --> 00:34:31.985
You said that like
Claire isn't your daughter.

00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:32.905
Natty.

00:34:34.745 --> 00:34:35.905
Natty?

00:34:37.505 --> 00:34:38.385
Yeah!

00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:41.025
My name is Natty.

00:34:41.945 --> 00:34:44.345
It's the name that reminds me
I'm no longer Claire's sister.

00:34:44.725 --> 00:34:45.985
What's the matter with you?

00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:47.665
Why are you so angry?

00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:50.545
I'm angry because
you all act like Claire doesn't exist.

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:55.265
You judge her by a single action, Dad.

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:57.905
And Mom,
you completely agreed with him.

00:35:00.505 --> 00:35:02.225
Claire killed a man!

00:35:03.665 --> 00:35:05.785
Having to change your name
and move to a different school

00:35:06.845 --> 00:35:08.865
wasn't because of what she did?

00:35:11.305 --> 00:35:13.385
She's nice to me, Dad.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:20.105
You don't know anything.

00:35:21.705 --> 00:35:24.665
Do you know
how much this hurts me?

00:35:27.345 --> 00:35:30.025
You keep telling me to forget her
and not talk about her,

00:35:32.185 --> 00:35:33.505
but I just can't.

00:35:33.545 --> 00:35:35.145
Do you understand, Dad?

00:35:39.505 --> 00:35:41.905
I want to see Claire.

00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:48.145
I just want to talk to her,
but even that is impossible.

00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:50.945
We...

00:35:50.985 --> 00:35:52.385
We don't hate Claire, dear.

00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:56.385
We've never told you to hate her.

00:35:58.665 --> 00:36:00.825
We just want you to be happy.

00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:04.145
Be happy?

00:36:09.505 --> 00:36:12.105
I guess you may have done
something wrong, then.

00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:18.225
Because I've never been happy.

00:36:33.425 --> 00:36:34.505
Girls!

00:36:34.545 --> 00:36:36.985
100 inmates are coming
to have a meal!

00:36:37.025 --> 00:36:38.385
The food must be
ready on time and tasty!

00:36:38.425 --> 00:36:39.105
Go!

00:36:39.145 --> 00:36:40.215
Yes, Chef!

00:36:41.385 --> 00:36:42.225
Salty.

00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:44.785
Bland!

00:36:45.065 --> 00:36:47.105
Brown rice.
It contains minerals and vitamins.

00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:48.225
Good.

00:36:48.265 --> 00:36:49.005
Yes, Chef.

00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:50.345
The inmates
are paying back their loans.

00:36:50.385 --> 00:36:51.705
I'll give you the cuts later.

00:36:51.745 --> 00:36:52.905
Gosh, finally.

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:54.625
Mangpor, my lipstick?

00:36:54.985 --> 00:36:56.465
I'll get you one
at the end of next month.

00:36:56.665 --> 00:36:57.945
Gosh, that's going to take forever.

00:36:58.105 --> 00:36:59.545
Beautiful girls can't wait.

00:36:59.665 --> 00:37:01.145
Do you want to borrow mine?

00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:02.565
You've already put on lipstick?

00:37:03.385 --> 00:37:04.745
What color is that?
It's like you're sick.

00:37:04.785 --> 00:37:05.905
I'll get you a new one.

00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:07.065
It's so pale.

00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:08.465
Kae,

00:37:08.505 --> 00:37:09.965
do we have to get rid of the crust?

00:37:14.385 --> 00:37:18.185
I told you not to cut it!

00:37:18.505 --> 00:37:19.505
Yes, chef!

00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:30.305
Don't stop working.

00:37:30.825 --> 00:37:32.425
I'm just getting my stuff.

00:37:50.225 --> 00:37:51.145
Oh...

00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:53.265
Next time, don't drop it off here.

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:54.785
This is no longer my place.

00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:55.685
I'll tell you later.

00:37:56.145 --> 00:37:57.035
Right, sis.

00:37:58.905 --> 00:37:59.905
Dao.

00:38:02.545 --> 00:38:03.825
I've changed my mind.

00:38:03.985 --> 00:38:06.025
Would you like
to do business with me?

00:38:06.345 --> 00:38:07.905
You can have Duen's cut.

00:38:08.725 --> 00:38:09.585
Huh?

00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:11.945
It's already little to nothing.

00:38:14.465 --> 00:38:16.305
I don't want your money.

00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:21.035
May your business thrive and prosper.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.825
It seems like

00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:24.345
you're going to stay here
for a long time.

00:38:38.945 --> 00:38:39.945
Karakade, my mirror!

00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:40.865
Yes, ma'am!

00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:48.625
Gosh! I can't!

00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:49.545
Where are you going, Deedee?

00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:50.585
Don't follow me.

00:39:10.545 --> 00:39:11.425
Don't run away from me.

00:39:11.465 --> 00:39:12.185
I'm not.

00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:13.825
I'm getting a female guard.

00:39:13.865 --> 00:39:15.305
I can't be alone
with a female inmate.

00:39:15.745 --> 00:39:16.985
I just want to talk.

00:39:18.145 --> 00:39:19.425
I'm not going to tell anybody.

00:39:19.465 --> 00:39:20.465
It won't take long.

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:24.585
What is it about?

00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:26.305
I want my lipstick back.

00:39:27.585 --> 00:39:28.585
It's against the rules.

00:39:30.825 --> 00:39:32.505
I know that it is,

00:39:33.105 --> 00:39:34.625
but can I at least use it up?

00:39:35.825 --> 00:39:37.665
Why do you want
the lipstick back so badly?

00:39:40.665 --> 00:39:42.265
It makes me feel confident.

00:39:42.585 --> 00:39:44.375
Being stuck here is bad enough.

00:39:45.065 --> 00:39:46.865
Can I just look a little prettier?

00:39:47.745 --> 00:39:48.745
You already are pretty.

00:39:57.545 --> 00:39:58.745
Stop messing around.

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:01.585
I am not.

00:40:01.785 --> 00:40:02.905
It's true.

00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:04.825
Even without makeup,

00:40:05.145 --> 00:40:06.665
you're still good-looking.

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:11.825
Here's the deal.

00:40:12.185 --> 00:40:13.585
I'd like to get my lipstick back,

00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:16.775
and if I use it all up,

00:40:17.465 --> 00:40:18.705
I'll stop buying more.

00:40:18.745 --> 00:40:19.585
Deal?

00:40:21.025 --> 00:40:22.185
It really can't be done.

00:40:25.105 --> 00:40:27.505
Please, can I have it back?

00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:30.905
I feel like I have no confidence.

00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:33.585
Please, please, please.

00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:34.505
Please.

00:40:44.895 --> 00:40:46.625
You always carry it around?

00:40:49.225 --> 00:40:50.905
I actually want to return it to you.

00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:54.265
It's just that I want a female guard
to go with me at first.

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.385
Mm...

00:40:55.825 --> 00:40:58.105
Next time,
you can just return stuff to me.

00:40:58.385 --> 00:40:59.545
I won't snitch.

00:41:00.785 --> 00:41:01.865
There will be next time?

00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:04.545
Who knows.

00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:08.345
But you said
you wouldn't buy another one!

00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:26.785
Duen, are you sick?

00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:30.025
You've been coughing like this
since morning.

00:41:31.105 --> 00:41:32.345
Do you want some medicine?

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:35.905
Mm... I'm a bit sick.

00:41:37.225 --> 00:41:40.145
Can I have some
of your antihistamines, Kae?

00:41:40.185 --> 00:41:41.305
That should make me feel better.

00:41:42.465 --> 00:41:43.345
I ran out.

00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:44.105
What?!

00:41:44.465 --> 00:41:45.585
How come?

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:47.425
The bottle was full yesterday.

00:41:49.745 --> 00:41:51.505
I gave them to others.

00:41:53.225 --> 00:41:54.505
Kae, you're mean

00:41:54.625 --> 00:41:55.505
and stingy.

00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.705
Sis, do you want a face mask?

00:42:02.945 --> 00:42:03.945
Give it to her.

00:42:03.985 --> 00:42:04.985
She's coughing a lot.

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:06.295
Right.

00:42:07.665 --> 00:42:08.865
Do you have one more?

00:42:09.305 --> 00:42:10.185
I'm out.

00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:19.615
Hey!

00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:21.425
Duen!

00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:32.025
- Oh, f*ck!
- Whoa!

00:42:32.585 --> 00:42:34.065
Duen!

00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:37.625
I'm sorry.

00:42:39.145 --> 00:42:40.545
Go and sit somewhere else.

00:43:26.845 --> 00:43:28.065
I want a new lawyer.

00:45:00.825 --> 00:45:01.825
How did you do that?

00:45:03.185 --> 00:45:04.505
I can do all sorts of things.

00:45:04.545 --> 00:45:05.545
I'll teach you.

00:45:07.425 --> 00:45:08.905
Your skills
are much cooler than mine.

00:45:08.945 --> 00:45:09.745
Come on, let's go.

00:45:11.985 --> 00:45:12.985
Let's go outside.

00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:38.785
What are you doing?

00:45:39.585 --> 00:45:41.305
I need to short-circuit it first.

00:45:41.745 --> 00:45:43.065
The security cameras will go off.

00:45:57.345 --> 00:45:58.345
I'll teach you later.

00:46:37.785 --> 00:46:39.825
I've never been outside at night.

00:46:45.065 --> 00:46:46.505
It's beautiful in its own way, right?

00:46:53.745 --> 00:46:54.865
Can I have your hand?

00:47:02.045 --> 00:47:03.045
What are you doing?

00:47:05.425 --> 00:47:07.265
I'm not going to cut your hand off.
Don't worry.

00:47:10.825 --> 00:47:11.945
Another one, too.

00:47:33.545 --> 00:47:34.865
I made it myself.

00:47:38.025 --> 00:47:39.465
Are you proposing to me?

00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:41.665
Mm.

00:47:42.505 --> 00:47:43.745
What do you think?

00:48:04.345 --> 00:48:05.545
After proposing...

00:48:07.105 --> 00:48:08.305
You also have to put it on.

00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:40.785
♫Flowers in the garden♫

00:48:42.345 --> 00:48:45.985
♫Being loved by someone♫

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:51.795
♫All the simplest things♫

00:48:53.025 --> 00:48:56.145
♫They all hit me like a drum♫

00:48:58.625 --> 00:49:01.465
♫Oh I always wondered♫

00:49:04.065 --> 00:49:06.785
♫What I'm tryna prove?♫

00:49:08.985 --> 00:49:13.225
♫Sometimes I wish I was cooler♫

00:49:14.425 --> 00:49:17.225
♫But maybe I was born to stay♫

00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:19.545
♫Maybe I was born to stay♫

00:49:20.225 --> 00:49:24.065
♫Warm♫

00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:27.825
♫Like the Sun♫

00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:38.305
♫Warm like a hug♫

00:49:40.185 --> 00:49:43.385
♫Warm for you♫

00:49:45.545 --> 00:49:48.745
♫Warm for you♫

00:49:50.865 --> 00:49:54.065
♫Warm for you♫

00:49:56.225 --> 00:49:58.825
♫Warm for you♫

00:50:01.545 --> 00:50:03.145
♫Warm for you♫

00:50:03.185 --> 00:50:07.625
♫Like a revolution against
the things that don't make us feel♫

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:13.105
♫Like a revolution against
perfection 'cause that ain't real♫

00:50:13.905 --> 00:50:18.625
♫Like a revolution against
the pressure that stops us healing♫

00:50:19.145 --> 00:50:22.625
♫Like a revolution against perfection♫

00:50:24.065 --> 00:50:27.865
♫Warm♫

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.665
♫Like the sun♫

♫Warm♫

♫Like a hug♫

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:50.105
♫Warm for you♫

00:52:28.105 --> 00:52:29.465
Our feet are just as big.

00:52:31.385 --> 00:52:32.625
Your shoe size is 38, right?

00:52:33.325 --> 00:52:34.125
Mm.

00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:49.025
[Bell]

00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:51.105
Why aren't you
writing your own name?

00:52:52.705 --> 00:52:54.145
You already wrote
my name on yours.

00:52:54.825 --> 00:52:56.705
Now I want to write yours on mine.

00:53:15.465 --> 00:53:16.665
This looks promising.

00:53:19.185 --> 00:53:20.865
When will the flowers bloom?

00:53:23.145 --> 00:53:25.145
I just told you,
when it comes to gardening,

00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:26.505
you need to be patient.

00:53:31.025 --> 00:53:32.705
Let me get
the coconut husks real quick.

00:53:33.145 --> 00:53:33.865
Mm.

00:53:38.705 --> 00:53:39.905
Inmate Claire.

00:53:40.465 --> 00:53:41.625
You have a visitor.

00:53:42.785 --> 00:53:43.985
I'm not available.

00:53:44.185 --> 00:53:45.385
Tell them I'm not coming.

00:53:46.985 --> 00:53:49.345
The visitor wants to talk about
your sister named Cream.

00:53:55.605 --> 00:53:56.545
Cream?

00:54:24.045 --> 00:54:25.585
How did you know about my sister?

00:54:26.845 --> 00:54:28.445
I'm not the only one who did.

00:54:30.825 --> 00:54:31.825
What news?

00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:33.425
About 19-Stab Claire.

00:54:35.185 --> 00:54:36.465
I found out

00:54:36.945 --> 00:54:39.185
she has a sister named Cream.

00:54:39.225 --> 00:54:40.265
[Remember
the case of 19-Stab Claire?]

00:54:40.305 --> 00:54:41.705
After the incident,

00:54:42.105 --> 00:54:43.905
she changed her name to Natty.

00:54:45.345 --> 00:54:47.025
You've been refusing
to answer my question...

00:54:47.145 --> 00:54:48.425
Is it because you didn't kill him?

00:54:49.385 --> 00:54:51.385
I guess I'll have to ask her myself.

00:54:54.785 --> 00:54:56.465
Go and spread the news.

00:54:56.905 --> 00:54:58.665
Claire is serving the sentence
because...

00:54:58.705 --> 00:54:59.505
[This is the younger sister
of 19-Stab Claire!]

00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:01.225
She's serving the sentence
on her sister's behalf.

00:55:04.185 --> 00:55:05.945
Don't mess with my sister!

00:55:06.465 --> 00:55:08.625
It's your first time
getting this angry, you know?

00:55:10.425 --> 00:55:11.785
The real murderer is

00:55:11.825 --> 00:55:13.225
[It's Cream who killed him]

00:55:13.265 --> 00:55:14.665
her younger sister.

00:55:21.705 --> 00:55:23.305
You really love your sister, huh?

00:55:27.145 --> 00:55:29.025
It's just like
how much I love my brother.

00:55:44.745 --> 00:55:46.865
I'll ruin her dear sister's life

00:55:48.505 --> 00:55:50.225
and make her suffer
as much as possible.

00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:55.025
That's nothing important.

00:55:55.065 --> 00:55:57.465
Do not trust the rumor about
the number of stab wounds.

00:55:57.835 --> 00:56:01.135
Officers are in the process
of collecting evidence.

00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:02.815
As for the other details,

00:56:02.837 --> 00:56:05.537
I am not allowed
to reveal them to the public.
