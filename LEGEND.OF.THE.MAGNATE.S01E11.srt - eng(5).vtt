[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.950
[Episode 11]

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.070
In the world of business,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600
goodwill is everything.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.090
Who would

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.039
truly drive someone to ruin? Right?

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.840
My apologies.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.400
We'll give you some time

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.840
to bow out gracefully.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.680
Alright.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Post the notices.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.400
Let's prepare to return to the capital.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.930
Before we leave, collect
all our outstanding debts in Pingyao.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.840
By the way,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.640
the Eight Families
have asked me to check,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.350
for the 6 million taels of silver,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.240
would you prefer it
to be transported physically by cart,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.560
or provided as banknotes?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.410
My father said

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.050
to leave it here

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.080
as a gesture of goodwill.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.190
No wonder.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.660
No wonder what?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.190
No wonder your father's business
grew so vast.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.390
That was a remarkably

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.060
gracious thing to say.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.150
Are you praising him,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.280
or making a dig at me?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.430
But there's one thing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.960
I genuinely don't understand.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.560
Where exactly did I go wrong?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.240
Enlighten me.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.070
You overestimate me.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.920
I'll need to reflect on this properly.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.650
When you leave for the capital,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.120
I'll give you the answer in person.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.330
Chief Manager.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.880
Greetings, Madam.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.800
Greetings, Mr. Li and Mr. Sun.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.590
-Greetings, Chief Manager.
-Greetings, Chief Manager.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.080
Well,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.630
today I brought just 100 grams

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.080
of the finest Da Hong Pao tea

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.280
from the mother trees in Fujian.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.079
Let's have it before we start drinking.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:17.470
Great.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.730
Mr. Gu might be hungry.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.520
Let's have the meal first
and enjoy the tea later.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.050
Alright.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.840
I can't speak for his hunger,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.329
but I've been craving

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560
this tea for ages.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.190
At my age, how could I get so hooked on—

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.800
No, no.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.770
I mean, it's all thanks
to the Chief Manager.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.770
The Chief Manager has arrived.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.430
Sir,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.150
I'm like a monkey dressed in royal robes—
utterly unworthy of such honor.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.360
Please, no more jokes at my expense.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.090
You flatter me beyond measure.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.790
After you.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.080
If he can string four words together,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.680
consider it a grand gesture.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.550
My whole life,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.870
I've only heard him speak
in two-word grunts.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.900
Right, Cripple?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.720
Piss off.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.490
See what I mean?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.800
Mr. Gu,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.040
sorry, I mean Chief Manager Gu.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.270
I will ask you a series of questions,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.750
and I expect an answer to each one.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.390
Don't worry about offending us
with your answers—

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.390
if you dislike the questions themselves,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.190
just say so.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.190
Very well.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.460
Do you truly wish
to join the Eight Families?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.750
I don't.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.600
To be honest with everyone here,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.820
I'm an exile

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.800
who escaped from Ningguta.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.190
The benefactor who saved me

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.850
was captured by Wang Tiangui.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.310
He used that to threaten me

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.830
and force me into running his business.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.390
His obsession

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.460
with joining the Eight Families

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.660
stems from his desire

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.530
to uncover King Li's Treasure,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.830
which was also the reason

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.150
for our previous trip to Jinyang Villa.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.870
This is unexpected.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.810
Now you know

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.270
I'm a man without

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.530
even a legal identity.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.320
How could I possibly be worthy

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.850
of serving as your chief manager?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.850
I've long admired

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.430
the Eight Families of Hedong,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.260
and meeting you

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.660
only deepens my respect.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.320
The privilege of knowing you

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.920
is fortune enough—

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.350
I dare not

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.870
hope for more.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.750
Please deliberate among yourselves.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.360
I will...

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.240
take my leave.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.750
So what if you're an exile?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.870
Even Emperor Taizu of Ming

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.870
was once a beggar.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.430
A true hero should be judged
by his deeds, not his origins.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.920
No,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.720
the matters you need to discuss

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.780
are confidential.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.950
My staying

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.900
would only pose a risk to all of you.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.360
It's better this way.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.040
Mr. Gu.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.390
Mr. Gu.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.620
By entrusting us with your truth,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.350
you've proven your sincerity.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.390
If we still couldn't take you

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.480
into our confidence,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.560
then what would that make
the Eight Families of Hedong?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.480
Villains?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.950
Forget

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.100
about Wang Tiangui—

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.780
I have the deepest respect

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.840
for your character

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.740
and your judgment.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.240
I accept you.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.800
I am willing to take you
into my confidence.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.510
As am I.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.880
These past months,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.810
our draft banks

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.870
have prospered enormously.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.960
Young man—

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.510
no,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.120
I mean Chief Manager,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.690
if Wang Tiangui releases you,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.450
I will personally drive you

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.600
to my estate.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.870
Must you ramble so?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.510
Wencai, what's your stance?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.100
Chief Manager.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.290
In that case,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.000
Mr. Gu is now one of the Eight Families.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.420
Where are you going?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.310
I purchased this military map

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.040
from the Governor of Shandong.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.160
The Prince's troops have

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.430
advanced to this location—

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.390
the border between Shandong and Henan,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.050
at Caozhou.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.820
You're trying to borrow a knife
to kill someone!

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.830
The Prince's cavalry

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.800
is invincible,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.480
battle-hardened and triumphant.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.950
How could those unarmed Resistance Army

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.210
possibly handle them?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.630
Those poor souls

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.159
wouldn't risk their necks rebelling

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.330
if they hadn't been

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.130
dispossessed of their land

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.360
and left homeless.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.680
Throwing them

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.140
against seasoned troops—

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.720
what if the blade backfires

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.400
and gets them slaughtered?

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.360
Haven't we funded
the Resistance Army before?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.680
Repeatedly, in fact.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.000
Money is the whetstone—

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.320
it determines how sharp the blade becomes.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.720
To clarify for our chief manager:

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.050
our trade operations

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.800
require dealing

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.230
with all local factions.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.510
We maintain relations

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.100
with commanders
of the Resistance Army as well.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.480
"Money is the whetstone"—

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.310
well said.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.830
What's your plan?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.140
I've had our Hebei branches

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.190
acquire 2,000 horses from the grasslands,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.670
shipping them via the Grand Canal

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.530
to Shandong.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.620
The plan is to use the horse caravan

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.270
to unite all Resistance Army units

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.200
across Shandong

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.000
and launch a coordinated siege.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.100
I know nothing of military strategy,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.830
but I gave them one clear order:

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.850
Don't let that Prince leave alive.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.750
Stop running, you Qing lackeys!

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.549
Stop running, you Qing lackeys!

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.630
Freeze!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.799
Qing lackeys!

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.840
Sir!

where I'll land?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.720
Once

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.580
amnesty grants me

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.930
freedom,

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.330
I'll come find you.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.290
You're leaving again?

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.880
Every opera

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.760
must end.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.339
I remain here for now—

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.400
there are still people I need to save.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.800
Farewell.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.400
[Greeting the Zephyr]

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.470
But Mr. Gu,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.859
people will remember

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.930
how we shook Pingyao to its core

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.849
with gatehouse pawning,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:25.829
door-to-door pawning,

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:26.920
and temple pawning—

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.230
forcing every

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.160
draft bank and pawnshop
in Pingyao to kneel!

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.200
What glorious madness!

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.660
They'll remember indeed.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.870
[Greeting the Zephyr]

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.170
Everyone, a toast!

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.030
To our chief manager,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.240
Mr. Gu,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.240
and to the Eight Families

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.840
for gaining such a talent!

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.970
Bottoms up!

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.750
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.410
Bottoms up!

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.910
Enjoy. Enjoy.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.720
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.720
Help yourselves.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.930
Chief Manager,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.220
you seem preoccupied.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.110
I was thinking...

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.880
the Prince had
such a formidable reputation.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.010
Yet he was brought down
just like that?

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.990
You

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.220
still don't fully grasp

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.000
the power of money.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.000
Mr. Gu,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.070
would you like to know

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.600
what King Li's Treasure is?

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.270
[Pingding Temple]

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.130
The so-called King Li's Treasure

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.130
is hidden deep
within mountain strongholds,

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.590
behind high walls

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.230
and intricate mechanisms.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.270
No one but the Eight Families

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.550
[Universal Radiance of Buddha]

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.750
can access it.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.450
Some claim

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.000
the King Li's Treasure

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.110
was simply abandoned
by the fleeing King Li

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.080
in a valley,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.960
stumbled upon by our ancestors,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.310
and used to build their fortune.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.830
That's pure nonsense.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.680
If fortune were that easy,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.040
the Eight Families
would have torn each other apart

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.500
fighting over it long ago.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.100
Don't you agree, Mr. Gu?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.390
Indeed.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.200
A leader like King Li—

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.320
seasoned in battle, a visionary—

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.250
fought his way out of encirclement

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.840
with just eighteen riders.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.200
How could such a hero

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.870
fail to protect

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
his army's funds?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.100
The truth is,

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.890
he already knew then

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.980
that Heaven's Mandate

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.800
had slipped from his grasp.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.160
Unwilling to let his empire
fall entirely into others' hands,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:04.890
he entrusted

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.790
eight of his most loyal commanders

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.780
with the wealth

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.920
[In Memory of the Valiant General,
Ma Shiyao, Great Shun Dynasty]

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.960
accumulated over decades—

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.000
including treasures

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.880
[In Memory of the Valiant General,
Liu Tichun, Great Shun Dynasty]

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.030
taken from Emperor Chongzhen

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.550
and confiscated

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.000
from corrupt officials.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.730
This fortune

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.140
was meant to be the foundation
of the Great Shun Dynasty's restoration—

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.890
the means

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.130
to reclaim our Han Chinese homeland.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.680
The Eight Families
were ordered to remain here,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.600
using commerce as our cover.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.570
Thus, this fortune

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.060
remains with the Eight Families.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.940
And the responsibility rests
on our shoulders.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.050
Our ancestors

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.470
have waited generations

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.080
for the right moment—

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.440
and we may wait generations more,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:44.960
right?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.380
That is who we, the Eight Families, are.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.310
This hall

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.190
is one of the vaults
holding the King Li's Treasure.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.070
These Buddha statues and arhat figures

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.240
are all crafted from solid gold.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.350
In all the 200-plus years
of the Qing Empire

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.480
besides the leaders

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.110
of the Eight Families,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.640
you are the only soul
to learn this secret.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.130
So the King Li's Treasure

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.180
was never just a legend.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.320
But these items are so heavy—

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.680
how could they have carried them
during military campaigns?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.480
My brother,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.880
no one alive can answer that.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.530
The men around you now

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.090
are only in their thirties or forties.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.140
These artifacts

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.170
belong to events
from over two centuries ago—

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.880
five generations past.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.100
In their time, Mr. Gu Tinglin

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.270
and Mr. Fu Qingzhu

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.920
established a rule:

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.660
each year, the Eight Families

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.750
must melt down 10%

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.850
of their profits

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.790
into gold and silver objects,

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.590
stored here.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.320
Grain by grain, the silo fills.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.110
You may call it

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.440
the King Li's Treasure,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.110
or you may see it

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.240
as the crystallized effort

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.200
of every merchant
west of the Yellow River.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.750
Should the nation ever face peril

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.280
and need financial rescue,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.900
every last piece here

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.180
must be dispersed without reserve.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.400
This was our forefathers' vision—

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.530
a heart dedicated to saving the world.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.050
By showing you this today,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.070
we pass on

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.860
the Great Way of commerce:

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.920
to serve the people and aid the world.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.070
Wealth, in truth, belongs to no one—

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.310
it should be held in trust
for all living beings.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.280
I, Gu Pingyuan,
accept this teaching with humility.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.750
I captured Chang Si

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.880
and forced you to work for me.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.610
Do you hate me for it?

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.440
I wouldn't call it hate.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.210
More like resignation.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.690
Resignation?

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.600
No—you had nowhere else to go.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.400
True enough.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.570
Listen, young man.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.230
I'll show you a real path forward.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.270
Look up.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.160
Look at these account books.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.750
You were

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.590
never really a scholar—

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.310
you are a true merchant,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.920
through and through.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.540
In just a few months,

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.320
you've made more for Taiyufeng

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.550
than a decade of its usual

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.790
banking operations.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.270
You've got talent.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.480
And now you're even

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.770
the chief manager of the Eight Families.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.720
So tell me—

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.160
how should I reward you?

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.570
I own nothing of value.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.660
To me, money is just a burden.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.350
Don't talk like that.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.080
It's always those

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.640
without money

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.000
who claim money is evil.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.440
Money itself

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.960
is neither good nor evil.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.720
With money,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.000
you can accomplish anything.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.200
How could that be bad?

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.910
The rich buy carriages

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.790
to travel faster.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.920
But as you said—

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.110
I have nowhere to go.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.680
What use is speed

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.240
to me?

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.930
Do you believe

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.310
I could send you back

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.750
to Ningguta right now?

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.000
Do you know

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.240
how many people there

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.550
want you dead?

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.840
I believe it.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.720
But I won't.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.130
If you

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.920
could make money for Chang Si,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.880
why not

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.720
for me?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.260
Listen, young man,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.910
your showing up here—

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.650
that's heaven's will.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.410
It means

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.680
you and I are meant to walk the same road.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880
Look at this room—

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.270
all these ledgers,

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.550
all this wealth. It's mine.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.960
I…

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.860
Do you understand?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Understand what?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.860
Say it plainly.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.020
Become my son

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.280
and take the Wang surname...

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.560
From that day,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.950
Gu Pingyuan will be dead.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.090
The past will be erased.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.550
Everything starts anew.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.620
You're holding a winning hand.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.470
All the wealth in this room

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.930
will be yours.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.340
You'll guard it for me.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.070
When I die,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.270
I'll be buried right here—

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.000
watching over it for you.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:33.840
Chang Si is nothing but a brute—

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.650
a mere mortal.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.160
You've already repaid
your debt of conscience.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.290
What more do you need a conscience for?

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.200
[Prison]

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.960
We have an announcement for you.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.480
Gentlemen.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.930
What is this...

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.420
We're here to inform you

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.590
that you're going to meet your maker.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.660
It was Mr. Wang Tiangui

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.670
who paid for your death.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.270
You're a true hero—

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.150
when you reach the underworld,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.440
seek your vengeance on him.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.760
Don't blame the two of us.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.820
I'll confront him!

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.850
This is an injustice!

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:13.770
Restrain him!

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.180
Hold him down!

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.710
Let me go!

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.520
Restrain him!

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:17.640
Let me go!

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.730
As for Chang Si,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.720
leave it to me.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.550
The lives of that man and his daughter

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.590
are in my hands now.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.550
I will see them dead.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.550
I acted alone—

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.350
even if I must walk through fire,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.960
it has nothing to do with you.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.590
You just

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.350
guard the money for me.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.590
Let me be clear:

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.420
I've already taken the girl.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.240
I will claim her life

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.590
around this midnight.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.920
I've made sure

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.330
they'll say the killer was Wang Tiangui—

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.890
not you, Gu Pingyuan.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.570
You just want me

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.440
on my knees,

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.930
like a dog serving his master.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.090
That, I cannot do.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.260
Fine. Refuse,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.910
and I won't protect your life either.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.550
Father!

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.670
Hurry!

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.830
You

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.360
can reunite with Chang Si and others

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.640
in the underworld.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.460
Let's make a deal.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.470
You? What could you possibly offer?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.560
You think you're
in any position to negotiate?

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.440
The King Li's Treasure.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.230
Interested?

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.010
Stay still!

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.590
King Li's Treasure?

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.530
That's nothing but a legend.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.830
For centuries,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.930
no one has uncovered

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.320
its secret.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.030
Besides, I've looked into it—

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.060
the Eight Families

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.750
built their fortune year by year,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.570
through dyes and tea.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.970
Do you really think such a prize

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.750
would just fall into my lap?

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.940
Let me tell you something.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.840
I've just been there.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.240
Where is it?

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.790
Hold on.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.500
Mr. Wang says

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.640
we can let them go.

They say King Li

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.610
eventually became a monk.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.750
I doubt it.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.000
With a temperament like his,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.670
how could he have lived out his days

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.070
in quiet contemplation?

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.030
Come.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.010

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.080

to commission a Buddhist service.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.210
Would you assist us?

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:28.960
Amitabha.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.050
This way, please.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.150
You, Gu—

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.140
walk ahead.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.540

a massive treasure,

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.480
yet they can't enjoy a single coin.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.310
What a waste.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.690
If you understand that,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.830
why come here

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.420
to guard it alongside them?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.310
I don't like

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.550
his way of talking.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.920
Silence him for me later on.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.920
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.170

Gone to guard King Li's gate.

Did you really think
a man like Wang Tiangui

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.440
would share his wealth with you?

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.230
The moment you learned the truth,

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.550
you were marked for death.

A new reign is upon us.

will issue a general pardon—

by then,

start a tea trade

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.110
with us,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.400
and ship it to the north.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:20.840
Good.

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:22.430
When that time comes,

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.140
I'll seek you out, Mr. Gu.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.110
My family owns half a tea mountain.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.110
We grow Silver Bud

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:27.990
and Hou Kui—

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.340
both fine teas.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.630
They should sell well

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.840
in the capital.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.280
I've heard

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.710
even the Emperor can't get fresh tea—

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:36.440
is that true?

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.480
When I was young,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.710
the tea masters said

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.200
the reigning Emperor

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.600
prefered Golden Thread and Pu'er.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.100
What does he know about fine green tea?

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.150
By the time our green tea

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.210
reaches the north,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.400
it's almost stale.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.970
Then they scent it with jasmine—

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.540
the aroma is there,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.560
but the original flavor is lost.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.440
I've had that jasmine-scented tea

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.400
in the capital—

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.210
so that's how it's made.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.190
I'll await
your esteemed presence in Anhui.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.670
Once you've recovered your health,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:03.550
let's try

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.240
to reunite in Anhui.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.960
The moment I stepped out of that prison,

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.020
my legs started itching for the road.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.280
Over this past year,

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.480
I've come to realize—

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.100
I'm only truly alive
when I'm traveling.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:16.280
Mr. Gu,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.400
take care

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.640
on your journey.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.550
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.880
This southern expedition
must be executed flawlessly.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.540
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.790
Wait for us at the foot of the mountain.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:57.710
-Let's go.
-Let's go!
