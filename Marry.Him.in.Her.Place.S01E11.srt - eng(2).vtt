Come in.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.720
Drink this.

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:37.471
It's honey water

- Last night...
- Lin Yun...

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:53.524
How much did you drink last night
to end up in that state?

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:55.445
I don't remember a thing
from last night.

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:58.225
Nothing at all?

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:05.792
Who changed me?

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:11.574
Lin Yun,

00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.574
what we have is a deal. Nothing more.

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.632
You don't need to fuss over me.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.125
Remember what you said.

00:02:20.437 --> 00:02:22.474
If you get yourself into trouble,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.075
I'm not cleaning up after you.

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:26.111
Boss.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.072
Get lost!

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:45.441
I need ten men.

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:46.562
How much?

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.271
You're a pretty little lady.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.872
Why don't you keep me company...

00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:00.472
I'll take the job.

00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:03.471
30 per head.

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:04.912
Cash up front.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.151
Deal.

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:09.391
Put these clothes on.

00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:11.471
For today,
you're all from the Chengyun Society.

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:12.671
Got it?

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:13.832
Got it.

00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:19.471
If Mrs Lin loses even a strand of hair,
you answer for it with your life.

00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:20.672
Yes, sir.

00:03:20.712 --> 00:03:21.751
And

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:22.791
don't blow your cover.

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:24.871
If she recognizes any of you,

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:25.991
you end it the same way.

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:26.591
Yes, sir.

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:27.472
Get to work.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:35.871
Rest assured, Boss.

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:37.471
These guys all work at our docks.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:38.872
She definitely won't recognize them.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.899
So we're just acting as ourselves?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.300
Don't ask questions.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:50.917
Just do what she tells you.

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:55.711
You guys actually do look the part.

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:56.631
Of course.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:58.112
We're professionals.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.520
(Liang's Apothecary)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.471
Move quickly.

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:12.386
The apothecary just finished inventory.

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:14.151
I sent
the warehouse keeper home to rest.

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:15.792
At most, you've got an hour.

00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:17.267
Got it.

00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:40.432
Good work today.

00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:41.551
No,

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:41.911
Mrs. Lin.

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:42.831
I can't accept that.

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:43.952
What did you call me?

00:04:50.552 --> 00:04:52.392
Looks like you've got the lines down.

00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:55.512
Thank you, ma'am.

00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:57.872
He's not exactly the brightest.

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:01.592
We'll get going, then.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:05.871
She didn't notice anything, right?

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.391
I don't think so.

00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:08.071
Good.

00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:09.832
Or else, Boss will have our heads...

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:16.431
(Now, we see)

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.592
(if the fish will take the bait.)

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:43.712
You're from Chengyun Society?

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:49.992
This lighter belongs to Lin Yun himself.

00:05:50.275 --> 00:05:52.072
Who do you think I am?

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:55.951
So it's Mr. Liu,
Chengyun Society's second-in-command.

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.792
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:02.471
Someone wants to know

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:04.071
whether you'd like a cedar coffin

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.152
or a willow one.

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:08.951
Mr. Liu, you jest.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.071
My little opium den
has survived all these years

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.631
thanks to certain connections.

00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:16.871
I don't need to explain
what our boss and Song Zhichu are

00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:18.274
to each other.

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:19.635
Truth is,

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:23.112
Song Zhichu wants your head.

00:06:25.262 --> 00:06:27.822
Don't think you can fool me
with a few words.

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:33.471
Here.

00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:34.992
Take a look at this.

00:06:36.912 --> 00:06:39.631
Looks familiar, doesn't it?

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.671
Everything he promised you

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:45.031
is piled up in our warehouse right now.

00:06:45.032 --> 00:06:46.231
Impossible!

00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:47.551
We agreed on

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:48.832
an exclusive deal.

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:51.111
Do you still not get it?

00:06:51.112 --> 00:06:54.471
Song Zhichu wants a new supply route.

00:06:54.472 --> 00:06:56.111
You know how business works

00:06:56.112 --> 00:06:57.231
better than I do.

00:06:57.232 --> 00:06:58.192
Don't you?

00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:00.471
Song Zhichu! That scoundrel!

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:02.591
All these years,
I've done his dirty work

00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:03.991
and he takes the biggest cut.

00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:06.031
I only wanted a bit more commission.

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:09.174
Yet, he said giving me business at all
was already doing me a favor.

00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:10.214
If you die,

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:12.151
it's just one dog mourning another.

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:13.271
We're all small fry

00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:15.631
under our bosses.

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:18.152
We only have ourselves to blame

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:22.392
for not having anything
to hold over them.

00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:25.912
Wait.

00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:27.832
I do.

00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:29.032
What do you have?

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:32.391
Something that can keep him in line.

00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:33.991
I have a ledger.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:35.071
Every deal I've done

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:37.391
with Song Zhichu is written in it.

00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:39.271
If it ever gets out,

00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:42.432
he can kiss his position
as police chief goodbye.

00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:44.231
Let's make a deal.

00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:45.711
Let me go,

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.471
and I'll hand you the ledger.

00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:50.712
Take it for your protection.

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:53.271
If what you're saying is true,

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.311
then I'm spared a sin.

00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:56.472
I'll fetch it right now.

00:08:01.472 --> 00:08:02.672
Don't worry.

00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:04.774
I'm not lying.

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.557
(Opium Den Ledger)

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:10.831
Go. Now.

00:08:10.832 --> 00:08:11.351
Thank you.

00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:14.071
Who dares to pretend
to be one of my men?

00:08:14.072 --> 00:08:15.032
Mr. Lin!

00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:24.391
(Opium Den Ledger)

00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:26.511
Stealing from me,

00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:27.911
you must have a death wish.

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:28.871
You little rat!

00:08:28.872 --> 00:08:29.911
You dare fool me?

00:08:29.912 --> 00:08:31.152
I'll teach you...

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:38.031
Darling,

00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:40.511
enjoying the role play?

00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:41.511
He mistook me

00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:42.686
for Liu Xiu.

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:43.967
I never said I was.

00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:45.411
You set me up!

00:08:45.412 --> 00:08:46.612
I'll kill you!

00:08:48.112 --> 00:08:49.072
Liu Xiu.

00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:52.192
Boss.

00:08:55.152 --> 00:08:57.151
Someone wants to hurt my wife.

00:08:57.152 --> 00:08:58.271
Finish him off.

00:08:58.272 --> 00:08:59.192
Yes, sir.

00:09:03.472 --> 00:09:04.792
What are you going to do to me?

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.742
Little Fox,

00:09:09.752 --> 00:09:11.592
next time,
just ask me for what you want.

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:23.475
(So you knew all along.)

00:09:25.787 --> 00:09:26.471
(Opium Den Ledger)

00:09:26.472 --> 00:09:27.471
I told you.

00:09:27.472 --> 00:09:29.831
My father had nothing to do with this.

00:09:29.832 --> 00:09:30.786
I believe him.

00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:31.882
(Opium Den Ledger)

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:35.072
I believe you.

00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:42.031
Set up a press conference for me.

00:09:42.032 --> 00:09:43.591
I want that ledger made public.

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:46.111
The world must know
of Song Zhichu's crimes.

00:09:46.112 --> 00:09:46.872
All right.

00:09:47.392 --> 00:09:48.712
I'll make the arrangements.

00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:53.072

you were pretending to be drunk?
