Mr. Zhuo's just died,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.110
and you're already daring
to switch the goods?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.430
You have absolutely no respect for me.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.590
I was wrong, Boss, I was wrong!

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.190
It's not what you think.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.870
I did it for you, Boss—

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.830
I just wanted you to get a bigger share!

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.510
Boss!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.520
Dump him in the ocean.

Shanghai Police Station! Freeze!

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.720
Are there any other survivors?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.150
Dong, take him back to the station.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.950
Take him away.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.090
Get the rest of them loaded up.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.340
The initial on-site assessment confirmed

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.560
that Lin Weihao and Ali
died from gunshot wounds.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.630
Although Brute Zhang was shot,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.310
the bullet missed his vital organs.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.110
He's still somewhat conscious.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.810
Inspector, are you all right?

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.190
I'm fine.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.450
Head back now and interrogate him—

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.360
see if you can get

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.750
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.750
Look at yourself.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.640

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.140

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.270

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.310

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.950

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.480
-It's too bitter.
-Be good.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.270
That's a good one.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.120
Alright, out with it.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.460
Were you just about

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.630
to steal my medicine for Guan Cen?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.630
Lu Yizhen,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.870
look at you—you can't even
take care of yourself,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.830
and yet all you care about is him.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.240
Just how much do you like him?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.330
At this point, the whole world
knows how you feel.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.800
Keep your voice down,
will you, you drama queen?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.060
Any louder
and all of Shanghai will know.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.630
I want the whole of Shanghai to know!

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.510
Let's see how long it takes

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.190
for that blockhead to finally get a clue.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.920
And don't you dare feed him
my cold-prevention medicine.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.950
I wasn't going to feed him—

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.000
I was just about to offer it!

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.590
Don't you dare.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.630
Fine! Then I'll slip him sleeping pills—

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.360
I'll poison him, see if I don't!

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.270
Guan,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.720
look what I brought you.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.840
Whoa,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.570
did you clear out the whole hospital?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720
Get to the point.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.830
Do you have any new leads?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.330
Any news on Wu Chang?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.409
We've found something.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.080
According to his shop assistants,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.030
their boss

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.960
has been holding back their wages.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.030
I checked the shop's ledger—

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.080
they're seriously in the red.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.630
Plus, this new batch of antiques

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.360
was purchased with a bank loan.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.120
With the robbery causing such an uproar,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.600
there's no way he can repay it now.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.720
But something feels off—

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.920
almost as if he knew from the start
he couldn't pay it back.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.120
So, are you saying

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.560
Wu Chang was a wolf in sheep's clothing?

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.000
That he swapped the antiques himself?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.590
However,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.360
Wu Chang has been missing
since last night—

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.320
we're still looking for him.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.930
That lines up with what I found.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.840
When we captured Brute Zhang,

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.350
I overheard them
talking about counterfeit goods

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.500
and even mentioning Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.600
Zhuo Chaoxiong?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.910
Wu Chang set the whole thing up:

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.150
he had them steal the antiques

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.000
and deliver them

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.910
to a Japanese man named Sasaki.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.280
Zhuo Chaoxiong is likely
this Sasaki's superior.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.530
So if we find Sasaki,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.360
we uncover

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.770
the syndicate behind Zhuo Chaoxiong—

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.500
and finally learn the truth
about what happened back then.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.090
And to find Sasaki,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.110
it all leads back to Wu Chang.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.440
Speak of the devil.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.000
Time of death

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.660
was between approximately
5:00 and 7:00 PM.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.030
Cause of death is drowning.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.960
No obvious external injuries were found.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.960
However...

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.900
there are ligature marks on his arms.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.260
My guess is the killer

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.090
tried to use the storm surge

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.660
to wash the body out to sea,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.630
but it wound
up on shore instead unexpectedly.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.150
If it's been in the water,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.360
wouldn't most of the evidence
have been washed away?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.000
Right,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.570
we haven't found much useful evidence.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.960
But

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.570
we did recover a few fragments
of burlap sack—

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.120
you might want to look into that.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.580
We still need
to trace his recent movements.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.530
Leave that to the police officers.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.870
I'm heading out—

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.600
I have plans.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.790
You guys carry on.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.080
You have plans this late, Dr. Ding?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.290
If it were you asking, Director Du,

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.790
I'd cancel my other plans for you.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.910
But how could I keep you waiting?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.970
I'll pick you up myself another time.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.920
Alright, it's settled then.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.790
A promise is a promise.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.720
I'm off.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.470
W-What are you looking at me for?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.850
Dr Ding and I have been studying
that crumpled note

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.320
for ages and got nowhere.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.690
And now Wu Chang is dead.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.140
With Wu Chang dead,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.000
our link to Sasaki
and the forces behind him

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.790
is broken.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.790
I might have an idea.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.600
Hello, Boss.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.750
Mr. Du,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.320
it's been a while.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.150
And I see you've brought company.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.550
Yeah.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.360
Are you busy? Got a minute to chat?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.330
Sure, let's have a chat.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.570
You know

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.230
every Japanese person
in Shanghai, don't you?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.000
I know my fair share.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.440
We're looking for a Japanese man,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.900
and it occurred to us
that you might know him.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.200
Who is it?

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.100
If I can help, I certainly will.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.720
Sasaki.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.770
I don't know him.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.910
You really don't?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.910
I just run a small business—

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.390
how could I possibly know everyone?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.440
Please don't put me on the spot,
gentlemen.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.700
Order whatever you like. My treat today.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.180
Multiple homicides

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.200
are linked to Sasaki
and the organization behind him.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.390
If we can't find him,

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.480
who knows how many more incidents
like this will happen.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.010
Moreover, we've uncovered

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.610
that you have business
dealings with Sasaki.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.150
Dad! Dad!

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
Why are you out here?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.320
Weren't you playing with Mom?

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.100
I want to play with you, Dad.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.390
Alright.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.740
Gentlemen,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.510
there's no use wasting your efforts here.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.640
Please, just leave.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.030
The children Sasaki and his organization

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.230
are kidnapping are all around this age.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.320
They might never make it home,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.050
never see their parents again.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.480
Any information you have
is crucial to us.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.080
So Sasaki's into all sorts of businesses,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.480
but smuggling is
how he made his real money.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.000
Zhuo Chaoxiong must have been
providing him cover all along.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.510
My sense is that the cafe owner
probably doesn't know

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.310
about the forces behind Sasaki—

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:02.920
after all,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.920
he's never even seen Sasaki's face.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.480
According to the owner,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.000
Sasaki is extremely secretive;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
almost no one has seen his true face,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.100
except for the women
in the pleasure quarters.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.230
We're going to the pleasure quarters.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.520
Should we tell Lu Yizhen?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.670
We have no solid leads right now.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.750
Telling her would only
cause her unnecessary distress.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.840
But back at the Zhuo Compound,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.040
she made it very clear

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.810
that keeping her in the dark

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.470
hurts her more than anything.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.490
The situation is too dangerous.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.600
What if she insists
on taking the lead again?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.260
You weren't like this before—

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.500
you always had her on the front lines.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.180
So why are you getting cold feet
all of a sudden?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.000
[Maintain Law and Discipline]

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.860
Wu Chang's body

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.720
was found; he drowned at sea.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.410
Based on the evidence we've gathered,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.120
it all leads
to a Japanese man named Sasaki Jiro.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.790
to a Japanese man named Sasaki Jiro.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.200
The two had prior dealings—

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.930
mostly smuggling operations.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.180
So you're saying

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.670
Wu Chang and Sasaki Jiro

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.270
were in on this together?

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.120
To be precise,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.660
it was Wu Chang alone.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.480
He mortgaged his shop

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.670
for a bank loan,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.840
used the money to buy the antiques,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.440
and then swapped
the genuine pieces for fakes.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.960
After his shop was robbed,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.190
he couldn't repay the loan.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.390
The bank seized his shop

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.920
and those worthless fakes.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.390
He must have been extremely confident

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.390
about the value of those antiques—

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.250
otherwise, he wouldn't have taken
such a huge risk.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.820
It's a classic case of the hunter
becoming the hunted.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.810
He chose the wrong partner,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.140
and it cost him his life.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:40.910
Correct.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:41.910
The genuine antiques

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.550
must now be in Sasaki Jiro's possession.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.480
But the man

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.030
is highly secretive—

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.240
very few of his associates

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.150
have ever seen his real face.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.080
In that case,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.360
how do we get to him?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.440
Director Du has already launched
an investigation.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.870
All we have to do now is wait for updates.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.840
Meeting adjourned.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.510
What are you up to?

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.470
Why do you keep staring at him?

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.130
We don't exactly have major cases
at the police station right now.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.910
So why, after giving us one name—

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.150
Sasaki—is he just dropping

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.140
the antiques investigation completely?

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.290
The Inspector said

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.900
it's been handed over to Director Du.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.700
It makes sense for us to back off.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.590
There's something off about those two.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.220
Why are you so suspicious?

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.150
Last time, you suspected that they were
investigating behind your back,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.610
and now you're at it again.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.440
I'm heading out.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.569
Won't be back today.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.329
Don't overthink it.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.930
Why so serious?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.240
You've clearly never been here before.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.400
Come on, let me show you how it's done.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.200
I've been here before.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.830
You have?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.790
What for?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.210
There was a smuggling case
on this street.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.800
We came down to check it out.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.350
So it was you!

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.620
Do you have any idea

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.750
that you're the one
who killed this street?

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.350
this street became so dead?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.480
This place used to be full of women.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.780
Do you actually know where Sasaki is?

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.640
A man like Sasaki

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.000
would never settle

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.590
for an ordinary pleasure house.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.390
He'd only feel at ease

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.900
somewhere very discreet.

Sir,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.590

in music, chess, calligraphy,

My dear sister.

So it's Mr. Du.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.830
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.030
How could I, Madam Hua?

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.560
Aren't I here to see you now?

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.380

Let's tone it down a little.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.900
What a dashing and charming gentleman...

we're here today

You must be quite familiar
with Sasaki Jiro, right?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.910
Not familiar.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.450
I never met him.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.480
I don't know him.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.350
So sure?

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.110
Don't you want to think again?

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.750
Think about what? I'm busy.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.920
I don't have the patience for this.

What's on Madam Hua's mind then?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.030
Naturally, we take care of that first.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.640
How could I let you know

what's on my mind?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.080
Of course.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.510
But seeing this,

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.880
I do recall

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.510
there was this Sasa...

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.440
Sasaki Jiro.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.070
Right,

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.030
Sasaki Jiro. He's a regular
that comes here often to drink.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.940
Extremely generous with his spending.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.700
For him,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.860
I even arranged for Japanese geishas.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.930
You've seen him?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640
Do I need to say it to your face again?

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.790
If he's here, we're moving in.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.330
What do you mean?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.920
Let me make one thing perfectly clear—

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.200
I do not cross the Japanese.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.510
Don't even think
about causing trouble here,

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.240
understood?

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.640
Madam Hua,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.320
since when have you become so cautious?

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.790
You can trust me to handle this.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.310
How about this, Madam Hua—

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.710
will you do us this favor?

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.450
Another day,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.790
I'll bring my friends

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.390
for a proper night of drinks.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.830
Just one night?

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.720
As many nights as you like.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.830
Fine,

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.830
I'll hold you to that.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.480
Madam Hua,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.080
thank you for everything today.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.070
Oh, don't be so formal.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.030
And I'll be expecting you to bring
this fine friend of yours around often.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.200
We'll likely have to trouble you again
in the future.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.160
You got it.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.330
Just remember who's been good to you.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.980
You two are being so secretive…

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.240
Don't tell me you planned to meet up here?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.440
Well, young lady,

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.710
are both these gentlemen here with you?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
You've got your hands full
keeping them in line.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.730
You've got it all wrong, madam.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.430
What?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.270
I'll help when I can,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.000
and I'll give you a hard time
when you deserve it.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.160
Don't blame me—
you're the one who never visits!

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.000
Come by often!

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720
Yeah, you should.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.090
Why didn't you tell me?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.200
Look, we're here on police business.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.310
It's not something you could help with,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.240
so that's why I brought Du Linfeng!

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.290
T-That's right! I… I can explain this.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.550
You… you know

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.160
how it is with my job, right?

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.400
My job requires me
to deal with all sorts of people,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.310
and this is official business.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.830
Right,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.960
otherwise I wouldn't come
to a place like this.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.240
We're respectable men.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.240
I mean, what kind of man comes
to a place like this? Right?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.000
A place like this isn't… isn't suitable
for people of our status.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.880
Mr. Du, it's been a while.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.850
Whatever you need, just say the word.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.270
Y-You… watch what you say!

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.900
I could arrest you for that.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.920
I know about the case now.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.340
You can't cut me out.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.480
Fine.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.410
But you follow my lead on everything.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:47.960
Deal.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.640
Since Sasaki Jiro frequents
the Shihua Hotel,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.000
why don't we get inside first,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.920
wait for him,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.310
and see what intelligence

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.350
we can pick up?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.850
Let's start by locating his usual spot—

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.800
we might pick up some intelligence there.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.280
That approach could work,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.440
but we don't know

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.970
their customs or mannerisms.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.550
It'd be easy to blow our cover.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.350
That's where Madam Hua comes in.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.010
Going in the Shihua Hotel
undercover as a geisha

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.830
would make things much easier.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.350
No.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:32.830
It's not safe.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.620
Why not?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.310
The geishas at the Shihua Hotel

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.240
are meticulously trained to cater
to their clients' every preference.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240
A complete newcomer like you—

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.310
a seasoned regular like Sasaki

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.310
would see through you in an instant.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.530
How do you know that?

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.410
Du Linfeng told me.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.400
Then I'll pose as a maid,
serving tea and refreshments.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.110
No.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.520
It's not safe.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.280
You really aren't suited for it.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.920
Why not?

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.550
I-I also think it's not quite suitable.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.610
And your reason is?

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.310
Sasaki…

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.370
he only likes watching performances.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.970
He doesn't like women
getting too close to him.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.960
Now,

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.550
posing as a… attendant

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.170
might actually give us a chance
to get near him.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.590
So, Dong, you go.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.590
Me?

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.750
Please, watch your step on the way out.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.030
Sir, you're here!

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.590
Here, please take good care of our guest.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.920
Right this way, please!

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.030
Gentlemen,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.530
you've arrived!

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.150
Sir,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.110
please, come inside.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.110
This way, please!

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.960
Right inside, make yourselves at home.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.070
Come here..

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.950
Take care of our guests, will you?

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.110
Inspector Du,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.750
could you do me a solid?

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.400
My back is about to break.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.690
Just hang in there a little longer.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.400
I've been greeting guests non-stop
for two hours straight!

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.060
Seriously,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.020
I can't take it anymore.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.500
I really can't—

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.560
Sir, who shall I announce you for today?

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.320
Where is Cui?

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.790
Cui...

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.860
She's inside.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.140
What kind of attitude is that?

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.350
What attitude?

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.270
What do you mean, what attitude?

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.350
I already said she's inside!

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.030
Mr. Liu,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.940
the girls are all waiting.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.790
We've prepared some chrysanthemum tea
for you—to help reduce internal heat.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.310
Cui!

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.680
Mr. Liu.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.720
Cui, you're finally here!

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.550
Mr. Liu,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.880
what took you so long?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.840
Don't cause any trouble.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.030
I didn't say anything.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.830
No backtalk.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.820
Get to work.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.590
Did you enjoy yourself, Sir?

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.850
I had a wonderful time.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.910
Don't waste your effort.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.960
If you could actually see
into the deepest part

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.510
of that alley behind the Shihua Hotel,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.680
I'd have to send you straight to Dr. Ding.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.480
Then what are we even doing here?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.000
We wait.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.890
Director Du,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.270
do you really think our plan
of just waiting here like this

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:34.880
will work?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.070
It has to.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.110
Finding Sasaki

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.220
is the only way to uncover
the organization behind him.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.510
But I really can't hold on much longer—

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.790
my back is killing me.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.230
Just... just hang in there
a little longer.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.110
Mr. Sasaki, you've finally arrived.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.240
We've been waiting for you
for quite some time.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.440
Thank you.
Your thoughtfulness is appreciated.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.350
You're too kind.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.160
What are you two standing around for?
Get to work.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.760
After you.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.350
Right away.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.200
The geishas

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.550
have prepared
a special new performance today,

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.000
just waiting for your expert opinion.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.590
You've gone to too much trouble.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.960
Not at all.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.820
Your presence is an honor.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.770
Please, have a seat.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.730
Today's menu is made up entirely
of your favorite dishes, Mr. Sasaki.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.590
The evening has turned chilly,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.590
so I had the sake

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.590
warmed specially—

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.250
I hope it meets your approval.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.480
Very good.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.480
Shall I

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.080
have the girls join you
for a drink tonight?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.880
They would only be drinking.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.920
No, there's no need to trouble them.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.670
You're always so considerate toward them.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.290
Then allow me
to toast you on their behalf.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.830
Perhaps I should have them stay
to keep you company,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.200
so they can attend

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.550
to any needs promptly.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.760
Have a drink.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.110
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.790
They still have to attend to guests.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.510
Yes.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.550
I'm telling you

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.030
to drink.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.880
Mr. Sasaki,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.590
is that really alright?

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.680
If they get drunk,
there'll be no one left to help me.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.270
Yes.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.000
I said,

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.240
drink.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.110
Well...

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.110
Mr. Sasaki.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.700
This must be a friend of Mr. Sasaki's?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.440
Then we won't disturb you two any longer.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.640
What are you waiting for?
Go on, get out.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.310
Mr. Chen,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.450
please come in.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.680
Well then,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.820
please enjoy your conversation.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.960
So we've found Sasaki,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.480
but how do we get inside
to gather information

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.200
and uncover the organization behind him?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.730
What are you all doing here?

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.030
Now, don't say I never help you—

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.160
your chance has come.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.760
Mr. Sasaki has asked for a pot of sake.
See to it.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.790
Alright, I'll go.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.610
Let me handle it.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.370
Please, come right in.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.380
Director Du, you've been inside
for quite a while—

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.380
did you manage to find out anything?

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.070
It might be difficult to get
to him directly.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.000
He is usually stationed
in the area around Shop No. 7.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.440
I've heard that place is
a real den of mixed characters—

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.790
never actually been there myself.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.550
With all the competing factions there,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.960
most people would steer clear
if they could.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.790
Who in their right mind
would willingly walk into that?

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.200
But I've made an important discovery.
