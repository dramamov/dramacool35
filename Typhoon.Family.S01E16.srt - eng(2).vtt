TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:48.528
This way.

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.326
-What happened?
-Why did the lights go out?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.452
-Find the switch.
-Just go!

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:57.370
You damn bastards!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.919
-Ms. Cha!
-What's going on?

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.553
-Hey.
-Mr. Kang.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.763
-Hurry!
-Run!

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:17.098
Quickly!

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.017
-Ms. Cha!
-Run for your life!

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:23.021
Hurry! Hurry up!

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.775
What do we do now?

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.657
-Quickly!
-Speed it up!

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.284
Quickly! Hurry!

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.078
Just go. Move!

00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:40.455
Help her.

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:41.748
-But they're…
-Darn it.

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.458
Hey, wait for me. Oh, shoot.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.419
I brought some red ginseng drinks
for your energy.

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:47.545
-That's lovely.
-Thank you.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:48.463
Here, here.

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:51.674
Your flying kick was amazing, Mr. Go.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.344
-I sure showed them.
-Here you go, Ms. Cha.

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:55.845
I'll take a pass.

00:01:57.597 --> 00:02:00.266
Come on, Seon-taek.
Drink this before you go.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:01.726
Ms. Cha.

00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:21.621
You're overdoing it.

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:24.540
A bookkeeper doesn't make enough
to afford that nameplate.

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:26.834
Why not? It's because I'm fond of him.

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:29.671
Not as a man, of course.

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:34.217
Mr. Kang is here. Come on out, everyone.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.385
Okay.

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.391
Ms. Cha, come on.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.226
I'm coming!

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.561
CELEBRATING THE NEW OFFICE

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:49.065
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:57.448
What's up? Did you find something?

00:02:57.532 --> 00:02:58.783
PROMISSORY NOTE

00:02:58.866 --> 00:02:59.951
What is it?

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:02.870
Tell us what it is.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.710
"Creditor Kang Jin-young."

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:12.213
"Debtor Pyo Bak-ho."

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:16.634
This is it.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.137
It's the promissory note.

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:21.848
Is it the real thing?

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:23.933
Yes, this is the one.

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.646
I finally found the promissory note.

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.066
Mr. Koo.

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:33.526
Goodness.

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:38.948
Oh, dear.

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:44.203
Gosh, Ms. Cha!

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.210
-It's all good now.
-Oh, my goodness.

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.180
My gosh.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.807
Mr. Kang…

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.186
He had put it in here,
in the nameplate I gave him.

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:11.481
I gave this to him.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:20.990
This is so good.

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:25.745
Look, Tae-poong.

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:30.166
Your father's name was broken in half.
How can you be eating ramyeon right now?

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.585
It's so good, though.

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:35.129
I mean, I am sad.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.340
But this is so good.

00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:40.510
Just let him eat. He must be starving
after such a huge incident.

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.220
-For you, Ms. Oh.
-Thank you.

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:45.473
Giving you one whole egg means
I'm giving you my all.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:48.434
You can't give her the whole egg!

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:52.146
We're supposed to share!
There weren't many eggs to begin with.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.150
-You're being temperamental.
-Ms. Cha, join us before it gets soggy.

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:58.027
The noodles are already overcooked.

00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:03.574
What about kimchi?

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:05.952
-Come on.
-Kimchi, my foot.

00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:07.662
Steal some for us!

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:23.177
Tae-poong…

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:25.263
Thank you.

00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:29.934
Anyway.

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.520
It was 30% of his shares at stake.

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:35.565
I can see
why he made such a fuss to get this.

00:05:35.648 --> 00:05:37.650
This was the all-powerful document.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:39.318
It was many years ago,

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:44.699
when he operated a regular route
to Yokohama with just one ship

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.450
and he got into a huge accident.

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.202
Everyone said he would go bankrupt.

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:53.166
And Mr. Kang must've lent him money
back then with shares as collateral.

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.586
Then let's use this
to get our business back.

00:05:57.253 --> 00:06:00.840
I mean, how long
do we have to stay separated?

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.679
We're here together already.

00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:09.932
And we get to enjoy
this delicious meal together.

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.185
Isn't this great? Isn't it delicious?

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:16.355
Can we call this a proper meal?

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.566
-Should we add some rice?
-Add or no?

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:20.443
-Should I get some leftover rice?
-Yes or no?

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:23.321
FINAL EPISODE
WE MET THE BLUEBIRD, AND LIFE GOES ON

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:28.326
Now, these punks are truly frightening.

00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:32.121
Look at this.

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:35.708
They've done
this much research and investigation.

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.251
How did they…

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:39.212
Wait, this is…

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:41.505
It's my childhood family photo.

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.883
-What?
-I can't believe it.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.510
-What?
-Oh, my.

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:49.347
You were cute as a child.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.390
BUSINESS LICENSE
FACTORY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:55.311
Look at this.

00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:56.979
What's a PMP?

00:06:59.023 --> 00:06:59.941
Wait.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.984
PMP?

00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.030
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.537
This is a legendary video player
that even insiders like me

00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:15.498
have only heard about through rumors.

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:17.500
It's as small as the palm of your hand,

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:21.921
and you can watch videos on it,
such as dramas and movies.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:24.632
It'll probably ruin your eyesight.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.344
It looks like a confidential document
from a company abroad.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.140
A PMP with a camera as its feature
will be launched for the first time,

00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:35.017
but what's funny is this.

00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.563
The temperature rises up to 48 degrees
Celsius after 30 minutes of use.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:39.897
-Did you say 48 degrees?
-Yes.

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:43.359
-Isn't that hot enough to be a handwarmer?
-Right.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.152
How are you supposed to use that?

00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:48.531
But they'll be in trouble
if they fail to launch it this time.

00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:54.412
Because their stock price doubled
after the launch announcement.

00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:01.627
Overheating.

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:05.131
Overheating…

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:07.174
That's quite a lot.

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:08.843
PATENT CERTIFICATE

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:11.637
"Micro cooling fan for cameras."

00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:15.516
Small cameras won't function
without cooling devices to cool them down.

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:17.643
What's up?

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:19.061
A cooling fan!

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:49.383
THE PATENT KING OF A SMALL NATION
INVENTS THE COOLING FAN TECHNOLOGY

00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:03.064
-Mr. Bae, you brought that, right?
-What?

00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:06.192
Yes, right.
You told me to bring it, so I did.

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:11.238
JULY 3RD, 1998

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:14.909
What is he holding?

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.286
My father made that.

00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:20.581
That's it. That's a cooling fan.

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:23.626
It's like he's shooting a Cantonese movie
with that cooling fan.

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.088
That's it. That's what they need.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.965
If not, they can't launch their product.

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:33.052
Are you saying they pushed

00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:37.056
a factory into bankruptcy
and auctioned it off just for this patent?

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:41.644
-These punks should be cursed by fate!
-Besides, they're working together.

00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:43.688
Look at this.

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.232
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:48.192
Look at what Pyo Merchant Marine has done.

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:49.860
It says their ship.

00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:51.237
They bought a ship.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.322
They're a den of evil.

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:37.450
He never answers the damn question.

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:42.830
Well, at least
we found out what they're after.

00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:47.501
So why don't we give them what they want
and make a deal to get what we want?

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:48.586
Look.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.214
If they're buying the factory
because they need this,

00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:54.592
what if they no longer need this?

00:10:56.594 --> 00:10:58.262
Well, that's true.

00:10:59.388 --> 00:11:01.640
How can we
make the patent unnecessary for them?

00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:05.311
-My gosh!
-Goodness.

00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:07.563
-Then it should no longer be patented.
-Yes.

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:12.026
Think about it. If we can use it,
the factory across the street can use it,

00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:14.361
and Mark can use it,
it's no longer patented.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:16.197
Then he won't need to buy the factory.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.781
Release the technology to the public?

00:11:17.865 --> 00:11:19.909
You two are such a perfect duo.

00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:23.496
You two have such good teamwork,
people might think you two are dating.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.873
How many days until the auction?

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.334
-I'm not sure.
-How many days?

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:31.670
Three days.

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:38.093
An auction? Just thinking about it
is making me break out in a sweat.

00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:40.471
Well, we either go big or go home.

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:42.765
-No, we have to get it this time.
-Really?

00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:44.850
Can we share our offer
and ask them to back down?

00:11:45.434 --> 00:11:47.811
-That hurts!
-You might as well sell your place.

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:49.855
-Never stop.
-So we must go!

00:11:53.317 --> 00:11:54.401
Ma-jin, forget something?

00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:56.612
-Ma-jin loses.
-What now?

00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:01.617
-Take the blow!
-Take the blow!

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.161
PYO BAK-HO MERCHANT SHIP BLUEPRINT

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:07.998
CEO PYO HYUN-JUN

00:12:08.082 --> 00:12:09.166
Freckles!

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:11.460
I need iced coffee!

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:17.716
PLEASE KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:23.305
I already had your iced coffee ready.

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:27.393
What the heck?

00:12:30.062 --> 00:12:32.481
Please excuse me, sir.

00:12:36.193 --> 00:12:37.278
All good.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.825
-Where's Freckles?
-It's her day off.

00:12:44.743 --> 00:12:47.204
Darn it. Says who?

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:51.584
Jeez. I liked Freckles' recipe,
what was it again?

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.836
Three-two-three? That was good.

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:01.510
Did you spit in this?

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.054
I'm not that kind of a man.

00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:06.640
You're too much.

00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:07.725
Get out.

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.564
-What do you want? Go.
-I'll go.

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.243
Where did she go without telling me?

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:43.636
SEIZED

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.307
SEIZED

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:54.772
-Is it two days until the auction?
-Yes.

00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:57.733
-It's for a new business, right?
-Yes.

00:13:57.816 --> 00:13:59.652
Why do we have to do this?

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:02.488
It's a factory auction,
so we have to do it as a business entity.

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:06.408
Right, Pyo is currently
the CEO of Typhoon Trading.

00:14:07.034 --> 00:14:08.202
Let me see that.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.080
Okay, copies of IDs.

00:14:11.622 --> 00:14:12.706
-Copies.
-Power of attorney.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.333
Okay. Good.

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:16.043
-That document.
-Yes, right.

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:21.799
-What should we name the business?
-The name?

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.469
Well, it's only temporary.

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.432
MISEON TRADING

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.649
"Miseon Trading."

00:14:41.902 --> 00:14:47.408
Anyway, I'm not sure if the owner here
will agree to release the patent.

00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:50.911
We'll just have to trust him.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:16.437
Sir, what do you say?

00:15:18.689 --> 00:15:19.732
All right.

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:22.901
You have a point.

00:15:26.196 --> 00:15:27.364
It's still a shame, isn't it?

00:15:28.323 --> 00:15:31.201
No, that's not how I feel.
It's not a shame.

00:15:31.869 --> 00:15:35.706
It's much better and proper
for you to do that with it

00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:38.625
than for me to clench onto it.

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:45.466
It just feels futile, that's all.

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:50.387
All of these feel like my own children,

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.849
and I had kept the patent with me

00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:56.602
in case it could help
my employees in the future.

00:15:56.685 --> 00:15:59.772
But it feels like this is what
has been holding me back in the end.

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:07.279
Would I have avoided this if I had let go
of my greed a long time ago?

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:14.620
My father would've said…

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.165
that you weren't withering.

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:21.627
This technology

00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:23.796
is about to bloom

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.507
and bear fruit.

00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:30.928
Is that so?

00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:34.223
All right.

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:38.602
It's also a parent's job
to let the child go and grow.

00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:46.110
But why are you going out of your way
to help another person so much?

00:16:47.736 --> 00:16:49.279
I'm grateful for it,

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:51.573
but isn't it hard for you?

00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:57.329
Well, I've never thought about it.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:02.126
You know,

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:08.006
Typhoon Trading needs Dabontech
to be able to sell these.

00:17:09.007 --> 00:17:13.137
A factory is needed
for a trading company to exist.

00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:18.225
So let's keep doing this together, sir.

00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:22.229
You're a great businessman.

00:17:54.845 --> 00:17:56.054

00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:42.559
I can't believe it.

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:44.144
Zero typos?

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:01.453
Wow, this is fricking rad!

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:05.582
It's true.

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.210
Who released this?

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:11.213
Sir!

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:12.798
Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:15.509
Don't mention it.

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:16.843
Put it to good use.

00:19:17.511 --> 00:19:19.263
What? Other patents?

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:22.766
What kind of crazy talk is this?

00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:26.478
Stop talking total nonsense!
I'm hanging up!

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.693
DONGJU DAILY

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:34.278
Mr. Jang, you were waiting out here.

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:35.904
Please take care of this.

00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:46.039

ONE HOUR UNTIL THE AUCTION

00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:17.154
Will you hurry up?

00:20:17.237 --> 00:20:18.280
I'm sorry!

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:22.117
I'm sorry.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.203
What the heck is he doing?
Just run him over.

00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:27.497
I told you to leave it open.
Didn't you get the message?

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:29.374
I'm sorry!

00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:31.543
Stop saying sorry and open the darn thing!

00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:33.754
-I'm sorry!
-Stop saying sorry!

00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:36.506
-Yes, I'm sorry.
-What's with him?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.633
-Hey, you go and open it.
-Yes, sir.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:40.761
I found it!

00:20:40.844 --> 00:20:43.180
I found it. It's right here. I found it.

00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:02.074
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:11.666
Has he lost it?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.793
All done.

00:21:14.336 --> 00:21:15.379
Hey, just go.

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:19.966
Why, you…

00:21:27.808 --> 00:21:28.642
Hey.

00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:30.435
The player

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:31.937
has left late.

00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:35.899
INSAN DISTRICT COURT

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:42.656
Here you go.

00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:00.632
This is what you drink in Korea.

00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:01.633
I'm serious.

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:13.645
And take this too.

00:22:15.272 --> 00:22:16.398
I'm done with it.

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:26.032
It's our culture.
When we're done with a paper, we switch.

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:32.914
DONGJU DAILY

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:39.921
What do you think?

00:22:43.592 --> 00:22:44.718
How interesting.

00:22:46.386 --> 00:22:47.888
I knew you could speak Korean.

00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:55.020
What the heck is this punk doing?

00:22:55.687 --> 00:22:56.855
Damn it.

00:22:56.938 --> 00:22:58.857
Why the heck are you here?

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:01.693
Hey.

00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:04.112
I'm asking why you're here.

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:06.072
Why else? I'm here to join the auction.

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:08.658
Sorry? Can the penniless
enter auctions these days?

00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:11.369
Why are you so full of prejudices?

00:23:12.537 --> 00:23:14.206
I won the lottery.

00:23:19.085 --> 00:23:20.086
Good luck to us.

00:23:48.573 --> 00:23:49.574
What's our limit?

00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:52.410
What we can use right away
after the down payment on the ship--

Miseon Trading?

00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:56.683
Miseon Trading bids 30 million won.

00:24:57.475 --> 00:25:00.145
And Pyo Merchant Marine.

00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:04.274
10,000 won.

00:25:05.275 --> 00:25:06.443
Sold to Miseon Trading.

00:25:31.343 --> 00:25:34.304
PATENT ABANDONED! LET'S SAVE US ALL!
DABONTECH RELEASES COOLING FAN PATENT

00:25:37.766 --> 00:25:38.767
Isn't this good for you?

00:25:39.893 --> 00:25:43.313
You got what you desperately wanted
without paying a penny.

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:46.232
What's available to everyone
can't be called a technology.

00:25:56.117 --> 00:25:57.160
Because I am

00:25:58.036 --> 00:25:59.371
a trader.

00:26:00.914 --> 00:26:03.458
I sell things, not technologies.

00:26:05.168 --> 00:26:06.086
A trader?

00:26:09.297 --> 00:26:13.051
Feel free to bring your overheated PMP
if you don't think you can sell them.

00:26:15.011 --> 00:26:17.097
I'll sell it to the North Pole if I must.

00:26:21.476 --> 00:26:24.020
TYPHOON TRADING
THE REAL CEO KANG TAE-POONG

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:31.319
Have you lost your mind?

00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:32.695
What, 10,000 won?

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.322
How dare you?!

00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:48.753
What the heck is he saying?!

00:26:50.004 --> 00:26:52.507
Hey, forget that.

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:01.683
Did he just smile?

00:27:02.642 --> 00:27:04.060
Did you just smile?

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:06.396
-I've been too nice to that punk.
-Wait, sir!

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:07.313
-Calm down.
-Hey!

00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:29.794
SEIZED

00:27:42.682 --> 00:27:45.602
The machines, the business, and the people

00:27:46.603 --> 00:27:48.771
will all go back to their rightful places!

00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:53.026
We'll all go back to our rightful places!

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.205
Hooray!

00:28:07.582 --> 00:28:08.416
Good job, sir.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.792
Thank you so much.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.478
Good work.

00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:33.816
We can keep working here!

00:28:35.443 --> 00:28:37.278
What? You're going back?

00:28:37.862 --> 00:28:38.905
Hey.

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.021
What's with him? Why is Mark leaving?

00:29:53.104 --> 00:29:54.314
Is he leaving?

00:29:56.649 --> 00:29:59.235
-I'll bring some antiseptic.
-Forget that!

00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.987
What do we do now?

00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:02.697
What about our ship?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.824
The ship we already paid
the down payment for?

00:30:05.825 --> 00:30:08.453
Did Mark really leave?

00:30:09.537 --> 00:30:11.372
If we fail to pay,
we'll lose the down payment

00:30:11.456 --> 00:30:13.291
and may have to pay compensation.

00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:16.294
The intermediate payment.

00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:19.839
Intermediate payment…

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.597
Sell whatever we can

00:30:28.932 --> 00:30:31.851
and keep whatever we can,
whether it's a building or a person.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.190
And that includes Typhoon Trading.

00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:40.818
TYPHOON TRADING

00:30:40.902 --> 00:30:43.071
-What's going on?
-We work here!

00:30:43.154 --> 00:30:46.240
-We work here!
-We have the right to know!

00:30:46.324 --> 00:30:47.533
Where is your common sense?

00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:50.203
Don't just force your way in.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.082
-You have to stop!
-Just go.

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:56.376
Mr. Kang.

00:30:58.586 --> 00:31:01.881
-What's going on?
-There's no talking to them. We must go.

00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:03.758
-Move aside.
-We cannot do that.

00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:06.010
-You need to leave.
-I won't repeat myself.

00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:08.596
-Hey!
-Be careful.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.848
See? I told you so.

00:31:15.728 --> 00:31:16.688
Move aside.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.903
"Cancelation of Lease"?

00:31:29.075 --> 00:31:31.160
DECLARATION OF CLOSURE
CEO: PYO HYUN-JUN

00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:32.495
"Declaration of Closure"?

00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:43.089
Attorney Choi, go and print another one.

00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:49.387
This wasn't what you promised.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.638
Let go of me.

00:31:51.514 --> 00:31:52.974
I'm the CEO of this business.

00:31:53.558 --> 00:31:56.686
No. You just lost your qualification.

00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:01.816
So why did you get cheeky with me?

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:03.901
You should've gotten lost quietly.

00:32:03.985 --> 00:32:07.947
You're the one who gave up
and sold off this company, you idiot.

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:13.119
You bastard!

00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:34.849
I wasn't thinking straight.

00:32:37.143 --> 00:32:38.352
It's my company.

00:32:38.978 --> 00:32:42.231
-My company, which you abandoned.
-Stop talking nonsense!

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:46.360
I have never once

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.782
given up or abandoned this company.

00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:52.950
Just admit it!

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:55.286
You lost, you idiot!

00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:59.499
You think I'm the only one you must beat.

00:33:02.293 --> 00:33:04.170
I'm nothing, Hyun-jun.

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:10.468
Keep living in that delusion if you want.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:22.688
You've never fallen behind
and had to stare at someone's back.

00:33:24.023 --> 00:33:25.650
What do you know? Damn it.

00:33:31.572 --> 00:33:32.573
Typhoon Trading.

00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:34.992
Let's go home for today.

00:33:35.827 --> 00:33:37.453
You have to come back to work tomorrow.

00:34:10.486 --> 00:34:11.904
Oh, dear.

00:34:12.822 --> 00:34:14.615
Hang in there a little longer, Dad.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.534
Everything is almost over.

00:34:17.618 --> 00:34:19.495
I'll escort you to the hospital soon.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:21.247
But before we do that,

00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:23.624
I need you to do something.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.756
I made an order for a ship.

00:34:33.259 --> 00:34:34.886
-A ship?
-Yes, a ship.

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.889
The ship you loved so much.

00:34:37.972 --> 00:34:40.433
I ordered one
as big as the Panamanian one.

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:44.729
-You crazy idiot.
-What's wrong?

00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:47.940
I also kicked out that punk,
Kang Tae-poong,

00:34:48.816 --> 00:34:50.526
and took over Typhoon Trading.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.865
On top of that, I bought a merchant ship.

00:35:00.453 --> 00:35:04.165
I'm doing everything that you couldn't.

00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.421
But it turned out to be quite expensive.

00:35:10.504 --> 00:35:13.799
So I had to put up something
as collateral to finance it.

00:35:14.342 --> 00:35:15.509
Our building.

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:18.095
COLLATERAL OWNER: PYO BAK-HO

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:19.347
Dad.

00:35:20.431 --> 00:35:21.891
How do you feel right now?

00:35:23.476 --> 00:35:25.728
How does it feel
to be humiliated by your son?

00:35:26.812 --> 00:35:27.897
Who…

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.860
do you wish…

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:36.280
to win against?

00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:48.584
No one.

00:35:49.877 --> 00:35:51.796
I've already won against everyone.

00:35:55.883 --> 00:35:57.134
I've won already.

00:35:57.635 --> 00:35:59.553
I have won!

00:36:01.764 --> 00:36:02.890
I'll prove it.

00:36:17.488 --> 00:36:18.698
Proceed with this tomorrow.

00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:20.741
And I need to move him soon.

00:36:22.326 --> 00:36:24.328
Are you sure
about the hospital you looked into?

00:36:24.412 --> 00:36:27.373
Yes, it's not on the map, either.
He'll never be found.

00:36:28.749 --> 00:36:30.418
Okay, send him away immediately.

00:36:39.969 --> 00:36:41.762
I think he's sending him somewhere.

00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:00.740
There's been a change!

00:37:00.823 --> 00:37:01.824
This way, please.

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:04.076
This way. Come on!

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.703
Come on!

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:07.246
Okay! This way!

00:37:11.876 --> 00:37:14.003
Are we shipping out from that side today?

00:37:14.086 --> 00:37:15.838
The shipment is…

00:37:15.921 --> 00:37:17.715
What's the container number?

00:37:17.798 --> 00:37:19.216
-One moment.
-Give me that.

00:37:25.389 --> 00:37:26.223
Mr. Ha!

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:27.683
Mr. Ha!

00:37:28.392 --> 00:37:30.811
The containers on that side are all open.

00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:32.730
It looks like someone opened them.

00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:35.191
Why were those kept open?

00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:37.234
-Everything in Zone 15?
-Yes, sir.

00:37:37.318 --> 00:37:38.736
Have you called security?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.988
-Not yet.
-Give me the radio.

00:37:41.072 --> 00:37:42.615
You should've radioed them.

00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:44.450
That's a part of your work manual!

00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:48.329
Security, come to Zone 15.

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:15.648
I didn't know
you could do this, Song-jung.

00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:18.818
You're good at this.

00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:21.070
I didn't know you were capable of this.

00:38:23.322 --> 00:38:25.408
Be careful with that thing in the way.

00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:18.169
What? What's that?

00:39:23.841 --> 00:39:24.842
What's he doing?

00:40:13.724 --> 00:40:15.100
Gosh.

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:18.312
The air's crisp.

00:40:42.002 --> 00:40:46.048
PROMISSORY NOTE

00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:50.886
You actually found it?

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.472
Why didn't you pay my dad back?

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:57.476
You must've had that much money.

00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:03.315
I was responsible
for 350 people's livelihood.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.985
That was more frightening.

00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:09.363
Keeping them on my payroll
month after month.

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:12.074
Who cares about a promise like this?

00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:14.910
In this hellhole,

00:41:14.994 --> 00:41:18.497
you're supposed to trample on others
to get yourself out first.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.965
Can you walk by yourself?

00:41:31.594 --> 00:41:32.803
You'll let me walk off?

00:41:33.512 --> 00:41:35.055
Instead, testify that you received

00:41:35.973 --> 00:41:37.808
this promissory note
on the day we promised.

00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:42.104
Then I'll return to my business,

00:41:43.314 --> 00:41:45.274
and you'll return to yours.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.819
Everything will be the way it was.

00:41:51.447 --> 00:41:52.823
What if I turn it down?

00:41:55.951 --> 00:41:58.162
I don't care. I'll still let you go.

00:41:59.413 --> 00:42:01.665
At least you'll be able
to keep Pyo Merchant Marine.

00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:05.544
Those 350 employees you just mentioned.

00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:09.173
They also have to make a living.

00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:14.345
So you don't care
if Typhoon Trading disappears?

00:42:14.928 --> 00:42:16.013
Are you that foolish?

00:42:18.307 --> 00:42:21.810
My company isn't something that disappears
just because it has no name.

00:42:23.228 --> 00:42:24.313
That's why

00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:26.857
we will never go down.

00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:39.912
Do you…

00:42:43.123 --> 00:42:44.792
expect me to thank you?

00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:49.713
What I wanted was an apology.

00:42:51.757 --> 00:42:52.841
But I guess

00:42:54.843 --> 00:42:56.178
that should be given to my dad.

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:10.943
Hyun-jun must've learned…

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:14.613
from his father

00:43:16.031 --> 00:43:18.075
that this world was a hellhole.

00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:20.953
My father taught me…

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.290
it was full of flowers and fruits.

00:43:30.629 --> 00:43:31.672
Well, then.

00:43:32.923 --> 00:43:34.258
Good luck to you.

00:43:36.552 --> 00:43:37.928
See if the world…

00:43:40.055 --> 00:43:41.765
will wait for the flower to bloom…

00:43:44.101 --> 00:43:46.061
and the fruit to bear.

00:44:45.496 --> 00:44:47.498
-What's this?
-Can't you tell?

00:44:48.415 --> 00:44:51.293
I get annoyed when I see the things
you got me, so take them back.

00:44:52.127 --> 00:44:53.128
Hey.

00:44:54.838 --> 00:44:57.132
-Do you have to go this far?
-What?

00:44:57.216 --> 00:44:59.718
I'm much better off than you,
who can't do a thing.

00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:02.471
So what if you give me those eyes?

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:05.015
What a joke.

00:45:06.266 --> 00:45:07.184
Mi-ho.

00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:10.187
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Wait.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.189
All right.

00:45:13.023 --> 00:45:16.109
I won't hold you down or stop you,
but just give me a moment.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.531
What are you doing?

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.867
Just one moment. It'll take only a second.

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:39.258
Please just come on this day.

00:45:41.009 --> 00:45:42.469
Just this one day.

00:45:43.595 --> 00:45:45.514
JULY 17TH, 8:00 P.M.
FRONT OF MILLENNIE

00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:48.267
Please?

00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:51.853
I'll be waiting.

00:45:51.937 --> 00:45:53.188
What are you doing?

00:45:53.855 --> 00:45:54.856
What's with you?

00:46:02.864 --> 00:46:03.824
Gosh.

00:46:18.714 --> 00:46:20.507
Things just went haywire, sir.

00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:22.676
You know me, sir.

00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:28.348
What are you doing?
Come and beg him for forgiveness!

00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:32.269
You signed to buy a ship
without my approval…

00:46:32.352 --> 00:46:34.313
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
SHIP PURCHASE CONTRACT

00:46:34.396 --> 00:46:35.856
…got a foreigner involved,

00:46:36.398 --> 00:46:38.483
and sold off our company.

00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:41.278
Wait, Dad.

00:46:41.778 --> 00:46:43.155
It's…

00:46:43.238 --> 00:46:44.948
Will you hear me out?

00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:46.950
It's…

00:46:47.034 --> 00:46:50.662
The contract for the ship has been signed,
and the deal is sealed.

00:46:50.746 --> 00:46:53.206
You're right, Mr. Pyo Hyun-jun.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.585
You must take responsibility.

00:46:59.212 --> 00:47:01.423
-What?
-This is your malfeasance.

00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:05.052
You've used
the company's name as you liked.

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:15.896
Mr. Pyo Hyun-jun and Mr. Ha Seong-il.

00:47:16.647 --> 00:47:19.107
You two are under arrest without warrant

00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:21.777
for malpractice and embezzlement
against Pyo Merchant Marine

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.614
as well as suspicions
of arson at the warehouse

00:47:25.697 --> 00:47:26.948
in Yeonhwa-dong, Incheon.

00:47:30.827 --> 00:47:31.995
Dad.

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.456
Let go. Let go of me!

00:47:34.539 --> 00:47:36.750
-Dad!
-Mr. Pyo, I have to tell you something.

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:39.044
Let go of me. Let go!

00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:41.546
Dad!

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:42.798
Dad! Damn it.

00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:44.549
Dad, you saw everything.

00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:46.134
I won against that punk.

00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:48.136
I won against Tae-poong!

00:47:49.096 --> 00:47:50.555
I took him down.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.768
Dad, I won!

00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:56.228
Dad.

00:48:03.026 --> 00:48:04.069
Dad…

00:48:06.238 --> 00:48:07.823
It's all over now.

00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:10.867
I'm almost there.

00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:12.202
Is that so?

00:48:23.255 --> 00:48:24.214
My son.

00:48:28.093 --> 00:48:29.302
I lost.

00:48:31.221 --> 00:48:32.556
It's my loss.

00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:35.308
It wasn't you,

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:38.645
but it was me who lost.

00:48:41.732 --> 00:48:42.733
Dad.

00:48:45.318 --> 00:48:48.071
Can you just say I did a good job?

00:48:49.322 --> 00:48:51.158
I did a good job, right?

00:49:29.613 --> 00:49:32.449
What happened to Mr. Kang?
Why haven't we heard from him?

00:49:33.116 --> 00:49:35.911
I wonder.
Has he reached out to any of you?

00:49:37.287 --> 00:49:40.874
I don't see anyone
from Pyo Merchant Marine or Mr. Kang.

00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.836
Are you working the night shift today?

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.632
I got fired.
I was told to work here starting today.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:50.801
No news is often the best news.

00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:52.719
Let's give him some more time.

00:49:52.803 --> 00:49:56.181
Wait, why are you here, Ms. Cha?
The factory's busy right now.

00:49:56.264 --> 00:49:59.017
Me? I was told to work here
starting today.

00:50:00.352 --> 00:50:02.395
-Says who?
-Who do you think?

00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:39.015
Mr. Kang!

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:42.352
-Hey, Mr. Kang!
-Mr. Kang!

00:50:42.435 --> 00:50:43.770
Mr. Kang!

00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:46.356
Mr. Kang!

00:50:55.198 --> 00:50:57.951
What's with this red suit?

00:50:58.034 --> 00:50:59.578
You look like you're in a boy band.

00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:02.539
Three necklaces?
You'll get a neck disk problem.

00:51:02.622 --> 00:51:04.457
Your neuralgia must be better.

00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:07.043
You can probably button one more.

00:51:07.586 --> 00:51:08.795
-Should I do that?
-Yes.

00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:12.215
Look.

00:51:14.718 --> 00:51:16.970
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

00:51:18.096 --> 00:51:18.972
Wonderful.

00:52:01.222 --> 00:52:04.267
MILLENNIE STAR SEARCH

00:52:09.856 --> 00:52:12.400
Here is the next contestant.

00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:26.289
Allow me to introduce you
to our final contestant.

00:52:26.373 --> 00:52:27.791
Contestant number…

00:52:27.874 --> 00:52:31.586
It's a song he wrote himself.

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.797
The title of the song is "Wolf Star."

00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:38.593
Please welcome Contestant 13, Wang Nam-mo!

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:10.792
Left behind at the end of the night

00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:16.756
You flowed by in your loneliness

00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:21.720
Without a word

00:53:22.512 --> 00:53:28.351
You crossed winter with a blank face

00:53:28.435 --> 00:53:30.311
Casting a shadow

00:53:31.354 --> 00:53:34.190
And fading away

00:53:34.274 --> 00:53:39.696
I wish to reach you beyond this dark night

00:53:41.781 --> 00:53:48.246
When the world shakes like it'll crash

00:53:48.788 --> 00:53:52.584
I'll stay right here

00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:56.337
In the season where you stood still

00:53:56.421 --> 00:53:59.883
In that sky

00:53:59.966 --> 00:54:04.763
I'll stay here and shine upon you

00:54:04.846 --> 00:54:08.391
Even when everything disappears

00:54:08.475 --> 00:54:12.896
Even when I can no longer shine

00:54:12.979 --> 00:54:16.107
With all my strength

00:54:16.191 --> 00:54:22.322
I will remain in your sky

00:54:26.743 --> 00:54:30.205
This cold and painful season

00:54:30.288 --> 00:54:33.500
Passing through

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:35.585
Wasn't I cool?

00:54:38.171 --> 00:54:39.214
No.

00:54:39.714 --> 00:54:40.548
Mi-ho.

00:54:41.382 --> 00:54:42.425
I will

00:54:43.468 --> 00:54:45.053
try my best without giving up.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.308
But that means I may not end up rich.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.020
Took you long enough, stupid.

00:54:54.104 --> 00:54:55.355
Instead,

00:54:56.815 --> 00:54:59.109
I'll sing for you every single day,

00:55:00.652 --> 00:55:03.780
make you laugh, and wipe your tears.

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:08.701
I'll stay by your side forever.

00:55:45.697 --> 00:55:47.282
-Be happy!
-Congrats!

00:55:48.074 --> 00:55:50.743
TYPHOON TRADING

00:55:51.327 --> 00:55:52.412
Isn't that cool?

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:58.001
You can save music in here.

00:55:58.084 --> 00:55:59.335
How many songs?

00:56:00.503 --> 00:56:02.964
-Up to 32 songs.
-What? Let me see that.

00:56:03.047 --> 00:56:04.799
Do you know what's crazier?

00:56:04.883 --> 00:56:08.720
You can erase it and save new songs.

00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:10.722
How many times? No way!

00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:12.307
Infinitely.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.224
No way.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.811
What is the pricing range
for this particular product?

00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:18.605
It's expensive. It's not cheap.

00:56:18.688 --> 00:56:19.772
However,

00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:23.234
think of what this thing can do.

00:56:23.318 --> 00:56:24.986
It's 250,000 won, but it's not much.

00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:27.113
It's 250,000 won?

00:56:27.197 --> 00:56:28.865
How do you put songs in here?

00:56:29.616 --> 00:56:32.785
You have to download files
by accessing the Internet.

00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:34.245
There are websites.

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:37.165
So you can't use this without a computer?

00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:41.628
I don't think it's a bad idea.

00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:43.796
It's tiny, and I can only listen
to the music I like.

00:56:44.464 --> 00:56:47.550
I'll eat my hat
if even a single person buys that.

00:56:47.634 --> 00:56:49.886
I got a cosmetics product.

00:56:51.179 --> 00:56:53.014
A cosmetics product? So cliché.

00:56:54.098 --> 00:56:56.726
This company
had been researching diabetes,

00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:59.312
then came across
this new substance great for skin.

00:56:59.395 --> 00:57:00.897
They continued their research,

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.608
and ended up developing it
into a cosmetic product.

00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:07.111
But France is still more well-known
for cosmetics products, isn't it?

00:57:07.195 --> 00:57:10.823
I thought what we needed
was a change in the way we think,

00:57:10.907 --> 00:57:13.576
like this company that made this
while researching for medicine.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.828
Foreign brands aren't necessarily better.

00:57:15.912 --> 00:57:19.082
Korea could be the best, you know.
It just needs to be good quality.

00:57:19.165 --> 00:57:21.292
In that case,
may I take it home and try it out?

00:57:21.376 --> 00:57:22.961
-Of course.
-Okay.

00:57:23.044 --> 00:57:24.003
Gosh.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.214
Goodness.

00:57:43.606 --> 00:57:45.525
ROSE DELIVERY
FROM HONEY-POONG

00:57:49.362 --> 00:57:51.906
Wait a second.
What are you two up to? What was that?

00:57:52.865 --> 00:57:54.158
Mr. Kang, look me in the eyes.

00:57:55.493 --> 00:57:58.538
Why did you squint your eyes?

00:57:58.621 --> 00:58:00.707
There was something in my eyes.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.542
There wasn't anything.

00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:04.377
Don't you know that they're dating?

00:58:14.721 --> 00:58:15.763
Goodness.

00:58:15.847 --> 00:58:19.183
Everyone in this world knows
except for you three here.

00:58:19.267 --> 00:58:20.768
It was so obvious.

00:58:20.852 --> 00:58:24.397
Yes, they're the OC. The office couple.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.691
Wait, so they held hands and stuff?

00:58:30.236 --> 00:58:31.321
Cut it out.

00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:35.575
You shouldn't do that at work.

00:58:35.658 --> 00:58:37.285
We'll be having galbitang soon.

00:58:37.785 --> 00:58:38.870
Well, well.

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:41.080
Are you going to stay?

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:42.957
Are you okay with this?

00:58:43.041 --> 00:58:44.834
What if he ends up fainting?

00:58:58.014 --> 00:58:59.307
Beom.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.892
Are you that heartbroken?

00:59:05.813 --> 00:59:08.024
Come here. Come to me.

00:59:09.067 --> 00:59:11.027
There, there.

00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:16.157
What's so heartbreaking
about Mi-ho getting married?

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.368
She'll come by often.

00:59:19.994 --> 00:59:23.665
I knew that guy would do this.

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:28.086
I should've kicked him out while I could.

00:59:28.169 --> 00:59:29.879
My goodness.

00:59:30.963 --> 00:59:32.882
Hey, Beom.

00:59:32.965 --> 00:59:34.634
I'm here for you.

00:59:36.886 --> 00:59:38.596
And Tae-poong, right?

00:59:40.765 --> 00:59:42.725
Don't even mention that punk.

00:59:43.643 --> 00:59:46.312
There's no use in bringing up a son.

00:59:47.021 --> 00:59:49.399
Mi-seon has been
coming home late, hasn't she?

00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:51.234
I know.

00:59:52.568 --> 00:59:56.864
Well, both you and I are
in the same situation.

01:00:01.452 --> 01:00:03.454
Mi-ja now has a boyfriend too.

01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:05.790
You're right.

01:00:10.586 --> 01:00:11.629
All right.

01:00:12.338 --> 01:00:13.548
So?

01:00:13.631 --> 01:00:16.175
You two are getting married?

01:00:16.884 --> 01:00:18.261
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

01:00:18.344 --> 01:00:20.012
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:24.517
We went ahead and found a good date
for our family meeting and the wedding.

01:00:26.227 --> 01:00:27.270
Oh, dear.

01:00:27.353 --> 01:00:29.230
Congratulations, young lady.

01:00:32.108 --> 01:00:33.609
Ma'am,

01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:37.572
our family isn't too well-off,
so we couldn't prepare much.

01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:39.323
Please take a look.

01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:43.995
-I got you a new outfit.
-Goodness.

01:00:44.078 --> 01:00:45.872
And a set of silverware.

01:00:45.955 --> 01:00:47.874
Oh, my. These look wonderful.

01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:52.837
And before winter comes,
we'll get you a new set of bedding.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.630
Why, thank you.

01:00:55.715 --> 01:00:56.924
In my case,

01:00:58.801 --> 01:01:01.929
I wanted to offer you this.

01:01:02.013 --> 01:01:05.141
It once belonged to my daughter-in-law.

01:01:05.808 --> 01:01:07.518
-Oh, my.
-It's for you.

01:01:07.602 --> 01:01:08.811
What are you doing? Take it.

01:01:08.895 --> 01:01:11.189
No, it's not for her. It's yours.

01:01:14.609 --> 01:01:19.113
You've done well in raising your son.

01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:21.741
Ma'am…

01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:27.038
I named that girl.

01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:30.875
I named her Mi-ho
because I wanted her to laugh a lot.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:34.962
So make sure she laughs a lot.

01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:37.381
Come on!

01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:39.175
You're the worst, Grandma.

01:01:39.258 --> 01:01:42.178
But she cries too often.

01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.096
Make sure she laughs more.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:49.685
So, Mr. Wang, have you sold lots of silk?

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.479
Silk?

01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:55.441
Oh, yes, ma'am.

01:02:07.537 --> 01:02:09.038
You can't eat this alone.

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.581
-Do you want one?
-Yes.

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:13.459
Should I eat the whole thing?

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:18.589
Have a seat.

01:02:25.096 --> 01:02:26.514
-I have--
-I have something for you.

01:02:26.597 --> 01:02:28.224
Come on.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.018
-What is it?
-You first, then.

01:02:31.102 --> 01:02:31.978
Well…

01:02:33.396 --> 01:02:34.438
-Is this it?
-Yes.

01:02:35.982 --> 01:02:38.860
Why don't we exchange these
on the count of three?

01:02:38.943 --> 01:02:40.444
Okay, where's yours?

01:02:41.487 --> 01:02:43.155
Where do you think it is?

01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:45.950
-One, two.
-One, two.

01:02:47.577 --> 01:02:48.703
-Three.
-Three.

01:02:48.786 --> 01:02:50.705
Here. What's this?

01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:52.832
-That's for you.
-It's heavy.

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:55.751
-May I open it?
-Of course.

01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:02.383
What are these?

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:05.386
Flower seeds.

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:15.062
What are these? Workbooks?

01:03:15.146 --> 01:03:16.647
"Class pass"?

01:03:16.731 --> 01:03:19.066
-For the college entrance exam?
-Yes.

01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:23.613
You've always wanted to go to college.

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:26.282
But you couldn't take the test back then.

01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:32.997
I want you to continue with your studies
just like you wanted.

01:03:38.586 --> 01:03:39.962
Gosh, flower seeds?

01:03:41.631 --> 01:03:44.050
That was your dream, Tae-poong.

01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:48.137
But a plant nursery
was too expensive for me to get.

01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:51.057
I'll make much more money
and buy you a plant nursery.

01:03:54.894 --> 01:03:55.937
No.

01:03:59.982 --> 01:04:01.150
I no longer need

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:03.527
a plant nursery.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.821
You told me that…

01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:11.869
stars still exist
even when they can't be seen.

01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:16.499
I thought about it

01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:21.045
and realized all my flowers were here.

01:04:23.673 --> 01:04:25.049
I found my sentiment too.

01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:30.972
This place is full of my dreams.

01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:33.224
Here at Typhoon Trading.

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:40.731
YEONGIL ACADEMY CLASS PASS

01:04:42.817 --> 01:04:43.734
You know what?

01:04:46.153 --> 01:04:48.990
I've always wanted to become a trader.

01:04:51.534 --> 01:04:55.454
I know I can do my job very well
without a university diploma.

01:04:58.082 --> 01:05:00.084
And I have

01:05:01.502 --> 01:05:04.338
both Typhoon Trading and you, Tae-poong.

01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:12.471
I think I'm pretty okay
just the way I am right now.

01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:13.764
No way.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.686
Ms. Oh Mi-seon,

01:05:21.147 --> 01:05:22.106
you're awesome.

01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:27.820
Out of all the people I've met,

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:31.615
you're the prettiest.

01:06:15.534 --> 01:06:16.702
What do you think, Mom?

01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:21.457
It's a bit too small, isn't it?

01:06:21.999 --> 01:06:23.292
It's so nice.

01:06:24.794 --> 01:06:27.088
Really? Let's have a look at the door.

01:06:29.298 --> 01:06:30.299
Does this open well?

01:06:30.382 --> 01:06:32.426
Goodness, you have a wonderful son.

01:06:38.057 --> 01:06:41.102
And it's tough to find
an apartment at this price.

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:48.651
Here.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:00.996
So?

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.832
Do you want to look at a few more?

01:07:02.915 --> 01:07:04.041
Tae-poong.

01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:10.339
Why don't we stay
at that place a little longer?

01:07:11.173 --> 01:07:12.675
Is it inconvenient for you?

01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:15.261
I'd love to do that,

01:07:16.595 --> 01:07:18.764
but our room gets cold in winter.

01:07:18.848 --> 01:07:21.350
I'm worried that you'll fall and get hurt.

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:22.852
Oh, my.

01:07:24.145 --> 01:07:27.898
Mi-seon may be stingy,
but she doesn't hold back on briquettes.

01:07:30.234 --> 01:07:35.364
Let's find a bigger place later
and all move in together.

01:07:36.532 --> 01:07:39.785
I mean, there's Ms. Bun-i and Beom.

01:07:40.369 --> 01:07:42.580
We can't just leave them alone.

01:07:42.663 --> 01:07:45.499
I'd feel too guilty to fall asleep.

01:07:47.334 --> 01:07:48.460
Gosh.

01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:53.883
I must've taken after you, Mom.

01:07:54.842 --> 01:07:59.180
Of course. You're just like me.
You're good at everything.

01:08:00.222 --> 01:08:01.557
And you're so cool.

01:08:02.933 --> 01:08:08.272
I mean, how are we so softhearted
even when we're completely broke?

01:08:10.274 --> 01:08:13.652
Who cares about money?
We have everything else.

01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:19.033
Dad treasured and protected us so dearly.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:20.701
He did.

01:08:22.286 --> 01:08:24.538
I've received so much.

01:08:26.415 --> 01:08:27.875
I thought I had nothing left.

01:08:28.584 --> 01:08:30.127
We were left with lots.

01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:31.295
We're so rich.

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:37.551
Okay, then. Let me think.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:43.515
Ms. Bun-i, Beom, Mi-seon, you, and me,
the five of us have to live together.

01:08:44.308 --> 01:08:47.728
I'll have to share a room with Ms. Bun-i,

01:08:47.811 --> 01:08:50.522
and Beom is growing up
and needs his own space.

01:08:51.732 --> 01:08:55.611
So he needs a room.
Then you and Ms. Oh, so four rooms?

01:08:55.694 --> 01:08:56.737
Will it be too expensive?

01:08:57.488 --> 01:08:59.907
-We need three rooms, don't we?
-Why three?

01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:01.951
Mi-seon and I will share one.

01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:06.538
You're thinking of that already?

01:09:07.206 --> 01:09:09.875
There's no use in raising a son.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.213
-I was just joking.
-You're lying.

01:09:20.094 --> 01:09:21.595
WELCOME TYPHOON TRADING
ON "EXPERIENCE LIFE ON SITE"

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:24.640
That looks hot. We might die today.

01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:28.310
So will it really help Typhoon Trading
to go on this show?

01:09:28.394 --> 01:09:29.561
Yes, of course.

01:09:29.645 --> 01:09:32.856
These days, we have to market ourselves
and get noticed.

01:09:34.316 --> 01:09:38.612
Hey, don't even ask. Look at his eyes.
He's not in the right state.

01:09:39.363 --> 01:09:41.323
Anyway, this cauldron looks heavy.

01:09:41.407 --> 01:09:43.909
Will it cost a lot to transport?

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:47.246
Mr. Bae, when we get back, can you look up
the freight cost to South America?

01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:49.540
Meat cooks well in these cauldrons.

01:09:49.623 --> 01:09:50.874
-Yes.
-In my opinion,

01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:53.627
you're the weirdest one here, Ms. Oh.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:55.254
Hey, the cameras are here. Smile.

01:09:55.337 --> 01:09:57.214
-Smile.
-Hello.

01:09:57.798 --> 01:09:59.550
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:02.428
-How's it working out?
-We haven't started yet.

01:10:02.511 --> 01:10:03.345
This will be tough.

01:10:03.429 --> 01:10:04.388
EXPERIENCE LIFE ON SITE

01:10:04.471 --> 01:10:08.726
You're watching MBS here in Seoul, Korea.

01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:11.937
"Experience Life on Site."

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:18.694
A trading company leading Korea
out into the global world,

01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:21.322
please welcome CEO Kang Tae-poong
and Typhoon Trading!

01:10:21.405 --> 01:10:22.698
Come on out!

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:25.701
-All right! Come on in.
-Hello.

01:10:26.368 --> 01:10:29.121
-There are many of them.
-They have such great teamwork.

01:10:29.204 --> 01:10:33.500
-They all came here together.
-Yes, and the CEO is quite good-looking.

01:10:33.584 --> 01:10:35.586
-Yes, he's such a handsome boy.
-Yes.

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:37.838
I'd like to give him ten out of ten.

01:10:37.921 --> 01:10:41.800
-Ms. Cha, your makeup makes you look ill.
-It's great to have you here.

01:10:41.884 --> 01:10:45.512
-I heard they had a rough day.
-Look at Mr. Koo. He thinks he's an actor.

01:10:47.056 --> 01:10:50.267
It would've looked much better
if you sat in the first row.

01:10:50.351 --> 01:10:53.395
Look ahead. We're on air. Please.

01:10:53.479 --> 01:10:56.690
-You want to show off your girlfriend?
-All right.

01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:59.818
A small business in Korea
creating quite the buzz,

01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:05.449
Typhoon Trading will take us
to a paradise of cauldrons!

01:11:05.532 --> 01:11:06.700
Let's take a look!

01:11:10.829 --> 01:11:11.955
All right.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.792
All you have to do

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:17.795
is melt the scrap iron here
to make a cauldron.

01:11:17.878 --> 01:11:19.963
How long will it take?

01:11:20.047 --> 01:11:24.343
You'll have to finish everything today,
and it takes about 11 hours.

01:11:25.677 --> 01:11:27.054
It looks tough, doesn't it?

01:11:28.639 --> 01:11:29.807
I told you.

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:31.058
Let's go!

01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:34.395
Looking great!

01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:44.154
-Going in.
-Keep pouring!

01:11:44.238 --> 01:11:45.906
-Let's go!
-One, two, three.

01:11:48.784 --> 01:11:50.452
-Careful.
-Okay.

01:11:50.536 --> 01:11:51.745
-Lift this?
-Yes.

01:12:06.635 --> 01:12:07.469
Gosh.

01:12:09.012 --> 01:12:10.139
Gosh, that's hot.

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:29.241
My gosh.

01:12:30.284 --> 01:12:32.327
Even the food is charred.

01:12:33.036 --> 01:12:34.955
It's because soot fell from your face.

01:12:36.832 --> 01:12:39.209
I need ketchup when I'm eating sausages.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:42.129
It's heavy.

01:12:43.213 --> 01:12:44.548
-It's so heavy.
-Goodness.

01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:46.258
The food isn't much, is it?

01:12:46.341 --> 01:12:47.968
-No, it's good.
-It's good.

01:12:48.051 --> 01:12:48.886
I'm so sorry.

01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:51.096
Koreans draw strength from rice!

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.934
Even the IMF crisis couldn't stand
against the power of a good meal.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:57.811
It's good.

01:13:00.564 --> 01:13:03.692
Their bodies may be covered in soot,

01:13:03.775 --> 01:13:08.489
but the small envelope in their hands
stand as proof of their sweat and time,

01:13:10.282 --> 01:13:14.203
a testament to how they endured
and overcame their darkest days.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.252
All right! Great work, everyone.

01:13:22.336 --> 01:13:24.254
One crucial step remains.

01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:27.549
Of course. So how much did you make?

01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:30.719
The six of us made 50,000 each,
so 300,000 won.

01:13:30.802 --> 01:13:33.764
-Great work!
-Great work.

01:13:33.847 --> 01:13:35.432
Now, everyone.

01:13:35.516 --> 01:13:41.313
A small Korean business, Typhoon Trading,
did something quite meaningful.

01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:46.318
Now, please donate the money
for a great cause to help those in need!

01:13:46.401 --> 01:13:47.528
Wait! No!

01:13:49.154 --> 01:13:50.781
-Ms. Oh, come here!
-Hey!

01:13:53.408 --> 01:13:55.661
It's now. Get on it with me.

01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:57.621
I don't want to. I'm scared of heights.

01:13:57.704 --> 01:13:59.623
-No, you can go.
-Come with me.

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:02.084
No, you can do it. I don't want to.

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:03.252
Move aside.

01:14:03.335 --> 01:14:05.462
I always wanted to be a prince.
Lift it up, please.

01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:06.880
That's so irrelevant.

01:14:06.964 --> 01:14:09.383
Hey, don't you know
the ladies are always first?

01:14:10.259 --> 01:14:11.260
Be careful.

01:14:14.263 --> 01:14:17.266
-The unicorn might end up breaking.
-Right.

01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:20.894
I didn't want to say this,
but I'm the CEO.

01:14:21.603 --> 01:14:25.440
Yes, you must feel sad,
but let the CEO have his moment.

01:14:25.524 --> 01:14:27.442
-At least let me hold the tail.
-Come on down.

01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:29.403
-Okay.
-Honey.

01:14:30.237 --> 01:14:31.196
Are you watching this?

01:14:32.573 --> 01:14:34.366
Happy wedding anniversary to us.

01:14:35.367 --> 01:14:37.536
-You've put up with me long enough now…
-Wait.

01:14:38.787 --> 01:14:40.372
Give it up for Typhoon Trading!

01:14:41.748 --> 01:14:42.708
Go on up!

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:45.711
Are you ready to go up?

01:14:45.794 --> 01:14:48.463
Here we go!

01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:53.010
-Whoa.
-Watch it.

01:15:02.227 --> 01:15:03.103
Mom!

01:15:21.663 --> 01:15:27.169
TOTAL AMOUNT: 8,027,010 WON
THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR A GOOD CAUSE

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:35.385
COUNTING DOWN TO THE 2002 WORLD CUP

01:15:37.554 --> 01:15:39.973
FACELESS SINGERS ARE ON THE RISE!
WAX AND BROWN EYES

01:15:45.395 --> 01:15:49.232
COUNTING DOWN TO THE 2002 WORLD CUP

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:58.450
KANG TAE-POONG
CEO OF TYPHOON TRADING

01:15:58.533 --> 01:16:02.412
Just as the sun always rises
after the dark passes by,

01:16:04.289 --> 01:16:08.794
if you hang on through your tough day,
you will come out stronger tomorrow.

01:16:15.717 --> 01:16:17.219
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

01:16:30.899 --> 01:16:33.485
There is a small business
somewhere in Ulchiro

01:16:33.568 --> 01:16:36.947
that stayed strong
through the dark times of the IMF crisis

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.075
and continued
to stay in business to this day.

01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:48.792
CHA SEON-TAEK
GENERAL MANAGER

01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:54.089
People say computers are accurate,

01:16:54.172 --> 01:16:58.176
but I still believe the human hand
is faster and more accurate.

01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:01.388
What? A battle with the computer?

01:17:02.681 --> 01:17:06.601
It's impossible for humans
to lose against a computer.

01:17:18.947 --> 01:17:20.490
GO MA-JIN
DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER

01:17:20.574 --> 01:17:22.951
Times may change,

01:17:23.452 --> 01:17:25.954
but I believe there are timeless things.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.374
Well, it's nothing much.

01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:32.461
But family love, comradeship,

01:17:33.628 --> 01:17:34.755
and patriotism.

01:17:34.838 --> 01:17:36.339
AUGUST EVENTS AND PLANS

01:17:36.423 --> 01:17:37.924
Things like those.

01:17:38.008 --> 01:17:40.177
TOTAL QUANTITY: 950 UNIT/BOXES
TOTAL WEIGHT: 6,300 KGS

01:17:45.182 --> 01:17:46.349
BAE SONG-JUNG
MANAGER

01:17:58.904 --> 01:18:00.030
Send me a friend request.

01:18:03.074 --> 01:18:05.285
Mr. Kang and I
raised these orchids together.

01:18:05.368 --> 01:18:06.703
KOO MYEONG-GWAN
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:08.705
People say, "Without haste, without rest."

01:18:08.789 --> 01:18:12.083
-If you continue to work hard, you will--
-Cut!

01:18:12.793 --> 01:18:15.212
Gosh, isn't this way too dull?

01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:16.296
Me?

01:18:16.379 --> 01:18:18.882
-What's so bad about the flowers?
-Over there.

01:18:20.008 --> 01:18:22.344
Excuse me.
Can we get an interview with you?

01:18:23.845 --> 01:18:24.763
Me?

01:18:26.348 --> 01:18:30.602
I believe we need the courage
to take another step amid a crisis.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.854
How can I put this?

01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:33.939
OH MI-SEON
MANAGER

01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:37.734
It may be tough to do alone,
but together, it's probably possible.

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:43.573
Oh, our company?

01:18:45.742 --> 01:18:48.203
There will be difficulties for sure.

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:52.123
But CEO Kang Tae-poong
and all of us share the idea

01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:55.627
that if we do not give up,
anything is possible.

01:18:56.419 --> 01:18:58.922
After all, it's all done by people.

01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:00.757
That means

01:19:02.425 --> 01:19:04.970
we're the ones that make it happen.

01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:11.268
Just like this, Korea did not fall apart
despite a huge danger like the IMF crisis,

01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:14.729
thanks to these small businesses

01:19:14.813 --> 01:19:18.817
that have taken deep roots in our society.

01:19:20.735 --> 01:19:23.071
Reporting from Typhoon Trading--

01:19:23.154 --> 01:19:24.990
Ms. Oh, we're late for the game company.

01:19:25.073 --> 01:19:26.449
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:27.784
Excuse us.

01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:29.035
-What?
-Pardon me.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.790
-Bye.
-I'm Seo Seok-gyu from Typhoon Trading.

01:19:33.874 --> 01:19:36.501
KEONNAM UNIVERSITY SUMMER
SOCCER TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS

01:19:36.585 --> 01:19:38.211
RECRUITING MEMBERS FOR THE DRAMA CLUB

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.557
Hey, hop in.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.142
-What?
-He's cute.

01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:53.768
He was talking to you!

01:19:53.852 --> 01:19:55.770
-Let's go.
-Okay.

01:20:08.158 --> 01:20:09.826
"Hop in"?

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:11.578
It's been a while, so I wanted to do it.

01:20:12.287 --> 01:20:15.248
You're with Next Revolution,
the gaming company, right?

01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:17.042
Yes, but…

01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:19.502
Are you really buying all these?

01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:21.421
IMMORTAL GORYEO
BUBBLE BUBBLE BANG ADVENTURE

01:20:21.504 --> 01:20:23.673
Why are you helping me?

01:20:23.757 --> 01:20:24.883
We're helping him?

01:20:26.301 --> 01:20:29.638
No, we believe in the value of these items

01:20:30.388 --> 01:20:31.890
and in your future.

01:20:34.142 --> 01:20:36.269
However, promise us one thing

01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:40.106
that you won't give up
and take this to the end.

01:20:41.942 --> 01:20:44.069
Hey, guys. Hop in!

01:20:44.152 --> 01:20:45.904
Number 17, Oh Beom.

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:48.406
Congeniality Award.

01:20:50.951 --> 01:20:52.035
Oh, my. Congeniality Award.

01:20:52.786 --> 01:20:54.579
My boy got the Congeniality Award.

01:20:54.663 --> 01:20:57.457
Oh, my.
Should I let him go to an art college?

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.042
His work is titled, "My Family."

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:00.794
DRAWING CONTEST

01:21:00.877 --> 01:21:02.796
MY FAMILY

01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:09.928
The dot-com bubble
is a huge problem right now.

01:21:10.011 --> 01:21:12.847
So why don't we try exporting games?

01:21:13.515 --> 01:21:16.810
Isn't that something Japan is good at?

01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:19.229
You're right,
but they're strong with console games.

01:21:19.312 --> 01:21:21.272
You know, the game cartridges
you stick into a machine.

01:21:21.356 --> 01:21:23.316
Yes, I know what that is. Game Man.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.360
-Yes.
-I got my kid a few.

01:21:25.443 --> 01:21:28.029
But computer games are different.

01:21:28.113 --> 01:21:29.990
First, it doesn't require a console.

01:21:30.073 --> 01:21:31.491
Also, the graphics are wonderful.

01:21:32.367 --> 01:21:34.577
A strategy game based on the Goryeo era.

01:21:34.661 --> 01:21:36.788
I've never seen anything like this.

01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:39.916
It's like the Asian medieval times.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.754
So why don't we invest a little
to localize the game a bit more?

01:21:44.838 --> 01:21:47.924
We can make different characters
for different countries,

01:21:48.008 --> 01:21:50.760
and find the best translators too.

01:21:52.554 --> 01:21:55.223
We're not simply selling games.

01:21:55.306 --> 01:21:57.100
We're selling culture.

01:22:00.478 --> 01:22:02.981
That sounds like lunch.

01:22:03.064 --> 01:22:04.232
What time is it? Goodness.

01:22:04.315 --> 01:22:05.650
Shouldn't we line up?

01:22:05.734 --> 01:22:08.069
-Oh, my. Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:22:08.653 --> 01:22:12.115
Anyway, why has Mr. Bae
been making that face?

01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:15.368
I'm trying to be the Smiling Angel.

01:22:16.953 --> 01:22:18.371
Eat well.

01:22:18.455 --> 01:22:19.581
-Stop it.
-Cut it out.

01:22:19.664 --> 01:22:21.666
Should I be the Smiling Devil, then?

01:22:25.003 --> 01:22:26.254
Dad.

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:28.882
I loved flowers.

01:22:29.883 --> 01:22:31.551
They were pretty and fragrant.

01:22:34.137 --> 01:22:35.889
I thought my world

01:22:35.972 --> 01:22:38.433
would always be filled with things

01:22:39.934 --> 01:22:42.604
that were beautiful and good.

01:22:45.273 --> 01:22:47.484
Then let's do this.
We'll all eat lunch together,

01:22:47.567 --> 01:22:48.777
and then play this game.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:52.614
I was devastated
when that world came crashing down.

01:22:54.115 --> 01:22:55.283
I thought

01:22:55.366 --> 01:22:58.953
my life would face
an insignificant ending.

01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:07.337
Today, Korea has officially
broken free from the IMF system.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.839
At the time of the financial crisis
in late 1997,

01:23:09.923 --> 01:23:12.342
Korea borrowed $19.5 billion
from the IMF but paid it back

01:23:12.425 --> 01:23:15.553
in just three years and eight months,
three years before the deadline.

01:23:15.637 --> 01:23:18.306
Korea has restored sovereignty
over our economy once again.

01:23:18.389 --> 01:23:19.974
Reporter Park Jang-beom.

01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:24.187
But still, when I turned my face,

01:23:24.854 --> 01:23:28.817
I realized my flowers were here.

01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:30.819
My sunshine.

01:23:31.611 --> 01:23:32.737
My rain.

01:23:33.613 --> 01:23:35.073
My wind.

01:23:36.116 --> 01:23:37.575
They had all been here.

01:23:49.254 --> 01:23:53.258
I now know where my flowers are.

01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:55.218
I'm no longer lost.

01:23:58.179 --> 01:24:01.099
At times, we'll face cold seasons.

01:24:02.684 --> 01:24:05.687
The pitch-black darkness
will find us again.

01:24:08.898 --> 01:24:09.816
But still,

01:24:10.817 --> 01:24:12.360
I won't give up…

01:24:13.987 --> 01:24:15.321
for my flowers.

01:24:15.405 --> 01:24:16.281
No,

01:24:17.907 --> 01:24:19.284
for my people.

01:24:38.386 --> 01:24:44.517
FINAL EPISODE
WE MET THE BLUEBIRD, AND LIFE GOES ON

01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:21.638
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:26:05.098 --> 01:26:07.100
