00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.480
So you're saying...

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800
They were all sent by my second brother.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.720
I dare not speak carelessly.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.560
Fine.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.800
What a wonderful second brother I have.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480
Here I am, far from home.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.720
He sent people to ambush my residence.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.160
Waiting for a chance to assassinate me.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.320
He wants to use my death

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.880
as an excuse to attack Ling An.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.880
What are the casualties?

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.200
Thirty percent of my people died.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.040
Ten percent were wounded.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.480
Go fetch the memorial.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.320
Yes.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.480
What's wrong?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.640
Is your back hurting?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.640
It's nothing.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.680
My back is just fine.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.680
You should still be careful.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440
How about we switch next time?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440
No, no, that's not necessary.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200
We're fine as we are.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800
Are you really okay?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.080
Really, I'm fine.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.440
Darn it.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.640
Here.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.280
Try this.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.000
I loved this when I was little.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280
Master.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.920
No talking while eating.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.280
Right.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.160
No talking while eating.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.080
Father.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.720
Are your eyes bothering you?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240
Should I get a doctor to check them?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720
I'm fine.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.920
No talking at the table.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.560
You have no manners at all.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.280
Rui Yu.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.640
Go to the office later.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.040
Go with your father.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.680
So you can look out for each other.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.920
I'm heading to the barracks, not the same way.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.640
Master.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.520
I mean,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.960
in a bit,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.720
see the good son-in-law off.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.320
No need to trouble Father-in-law.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.720
It's fine.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.480
Father's got nothing else to do anyway.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.240
Eat a bit more.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.320
No need for formalities.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
I heard

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.720
there was a fire at the Residence of the Hostage Prince last night.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.240
Prince Pan.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
Was everything alright?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.680
Now that I am in a foreign land,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.920
I can't control my own fate.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.760
But I am grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.200
Prince Pan, you flatter me.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.200
Having you stay in Ling An

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.560
is to strengthen ties between our nations.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.240
But my second royal brother

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.000
doesn't seem to think so.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.240
If I die in Ling An,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.560
my second royal brother

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.480
will act without restraint.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.080
But as far as I know,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.960
the Second Prince always advocated

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.440
for friendly relations with Ling An.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.000
Then Your Majesty must know

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.040
I,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.960
am but a discarded pawn of the Qian Yuan Royal Family.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.800
Even so,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.240
I still carry the blood of the Qian Yuan Royal Family.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.720
If my second royal brother sends troops recklessly,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.720
he'll be condemned for harming his own kin.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.760
But if I die in Ling An,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.000
then by reason and emotion,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.960
my second royal brother will seek justice for me.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.560
My eldest royal brother has always been gentle.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.720
He can't match cunning and schemes.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720
My second royal brother excels at both.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560
So,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.040
Prince Pan, you mean

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.160
the Second Prince wants to use your death

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.080
to declare war on Ling An?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.160
Exactly.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.400
What you said

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.520
I do not doubt.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.680
But what does this have to do with me?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.760
Ling An

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.080
is prosperous and strong.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.280
What is there to fear?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.240
I know

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.720
my life means little to Ling An

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.000
or to Qian Yuan.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.280
But I,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.720
do not wish to die in a foreign land.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.440
I am willing to be Your Majesty's

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.240
leverage against Qian Yuan.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.960
In exchange for Your Majesty's protection.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.480
Let me live as a retired prince in Ling An.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.240
And spend the rest of my days here.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.240
Rise.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.320
Qian Yuan envoys will soon arrive in the capital.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.280
Your residence's guards

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.880
I

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.960
will replace them.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.440
Then,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
I won't trouble you further.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.040
I'll take my leave.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.080
You may go.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.760
Father.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.280
The barracks and the Hanlin Academy aren't in the same direction.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.480
You don't need to see me off.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.440
Since I've promised Madam,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.640
A gentleman's word

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960
cannot be taken back.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.520
Don't worry, Father.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.200
I won't tell Mother.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.000
I'm not...

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.040
Forget it.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.560
Do as you wish.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
Your son-in-law takes his leave.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.360
Rui Yu.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.360
Our Nan Chenxiao,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.880
has he ever

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.160
done anything wrong?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.680
No.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.400
Really, nothing.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.560
Think carefully.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.200
My own daughter,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.280
I know her well.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.240
If it really doesn't work out...

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.280
Please, your family mustn't...

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.160
Don't worry, Father.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.000
Everything's just fine.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.240
You, you...

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.400
You...

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.400
I...

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.880
Father.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.280
What are you trying to say?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.200
It's nothing, it's nothing.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.760
Go on.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.960
Then I'll be going.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.840
How is it?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.200
The brushwork is powerful.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
It has a grand presence.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.960
I suppose Prince Pan found a famous artist.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.760
This is Your Majesty of Ling An's own work.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.120
It was delivered with the guards outside.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.040
Your Majesty of Ling An

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.240
Why send Prince Pan a Ling An landscape?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.400
To intimidate.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.840
All of Second Royal Brother's men are exposed.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.480
Yes.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.480
I had people investigate several times.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.320
The previous hidden spies are gone.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.600
That's good.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.400
The birds in the woods

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.960
have all come out.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.680
But there are more guards outside now.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.120
Isn't that a good thing?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.400
Everything is out in the open.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.360
Saves me

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.240
from all the trouble.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.440
Heaven covers me.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.120
Earth bears me.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.520
Heaven and earth give me life.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.120
With or without intent.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.720
Otherwise, I would starve.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.240
Ascend to the heavenly path.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.800
Or ring the jade bell.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.080
Roam the imperial capital.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.840
This pool of clear spring water

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.240
has stirred up the mud after all.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.360
Now it's all murky.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.280
Your Majesty, I greet you.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.400
No need for formalities.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.520
By order of my king,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.840
I bring several treasures.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.240
To wish Your Majesty a happy new year.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.120
The King of Qian Yuan is thoughtful.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.400
When I left Qian Yuan,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.440
I heard Ling An's border suffered

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.840
provocation and harassment from nomads.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.560
Winter on the grasslands

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.840
is always hard.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.800
These people are truly arrogant.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.840
But they have no fixed home.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.560
It's really hard to wipe them out.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.120
From what I hear,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.160
the grasslands are right at our border.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.120
I suppose

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.160
Qian Yuan

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.440
isn't peaceful either.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.960
I wish to form a new alliance with Your Majesty.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.120
Qian Yuan can send troops with Ling An

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.240
to clear out the nomads' harassment.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.120
Sounds like a permanent solution.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.640
This time,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.400
I have another matter.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.520
It is for

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.640
the Second Royal Brother

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.240
to propose marriage to Princess Yan Luo.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.440
A marriage proposal.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.360
Alright, alright.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.920
Look,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.000
Sir Rui,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.120
you're really impressive.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.680
You've almost solved all the lantern riddles here.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.440
I can't help guessing when I see a fun riddle.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.200
Two, right?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.680
Liang Jin

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.120
Do you want some candied hawthorn?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120
May I, sir?

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.680
Of course.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.800
Candied hawthorn.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.360
Four sticks, please.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.560
Young master,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.880
I can't hold any more.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.240
Then

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
let's just have one stick.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360
Then three sticks will do.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.120
Here you go.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.200
Thank you.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.120
Want to see the lanterns?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.680
Candied hawthorn.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.360
Let's go.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.120
Come.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.600
Sir.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.480
Where's sir?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.120
Miss must think we're in the way.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.240
She took sir away.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.040
Then

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.800
Should we go after them?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.120
No need to chase.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.120
Let's just wait somewhere.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.320
This one's pretty, that one's pretty too.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.560
There are so many lanterns today.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.240
Yes.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.480
The lanterns aren't as pretty as you.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000
Really.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.200
Sir Meng,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.920
No need for formalities.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.240
Please sit.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.240
I wonder how long Sir Meng will stay in Ling An.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.920
How long do you plan to stay?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.680
The king sent me to discuss the marriage alliance.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.000
And to visit Prince Pan.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.760
Father,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.440
do you still remember me?

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.680
Not just the king,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.920
the Second Royal Brother misses you too.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.920
He asked me

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.480
to bring you this.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.560
This...

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.920
This is my mother's keepsake.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.800
The princess found

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.440
Concubine's belongings not yet buried.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.760
She wanted to send them to the grave.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.000
But the Second Royal Brother was kind

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.000
and wanted Prince Pan

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.440
to keep a memento.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.800
Then please

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.440
thank the Second Royal Brother for me,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.320
Sir Meng.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.920
The Second Royal Brother said

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.560
"thanks"

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.000
is too light.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.680
He hopes Prince Pan knows his purpose in Ling An.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.480
Don't do anything against Qian Yuan.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.120
I understand.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.920
Prince Pan has been in Ling An for a long time.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.000
You must be well established now.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.160
This is a good chance

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800
to show loyalty to the king.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.920
So, Sir Meng, what do you think

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.680
I should do?

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.040
Ling An is as calm as a lake now.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.800
The king wants you to be a stone

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.160
or a drop of ink

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.320
to stir up the lake as much as possible.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.920
Make it as chaotic as you can.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.560
It's getting late.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.320
I should return to the post station.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.080
So Your Majesty of Ling An won't get suspicious.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.640
Take care, Sir Meng.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.520
They threatened me.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.320
They killed my mother, the concubine.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.920
They wish I'd die far from home.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.160
Now they want me to serve Qian Yuan.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.560
He's just dreaming.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680
Please, Prince Pan, calm your anger.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.840
Take care of yourself to avenge Concubine.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.840
Over in Pingxiang—

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.520
Any news from there?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.800
The late king's family holds military power.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.840
Pingxiang has always valued martial strength.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.200
Hou Qi can't find an opening for now.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.400
The people sent to Hou Qi to train assassins—

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.960
What did they say?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.560
Still short on money.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.280
Money.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.720
I worked hard to get them money.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.320
Can't even handle a thirteen-year-old.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.640
Tell him—

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.320
If he wants power, he must rely on himself.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.800
Otherwise, his nephew will soon—

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.800
take that position.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.520
Yes.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.920
I'll handle it right away.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.920
Your Majesty—

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080
What happened?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.680
The Empress Dowager fainted

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.680
suddenly while meditating.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
Has the imperial doctor seen her?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.000
He said it's from excessive worry.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.960
She can't eat or sleep well.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.840
No serious harm for now.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.480
What about the Qian Yuan envoy?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.440
He went to the Residence of the Hostage Prince.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.320
Met with Prince Pan.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.320
Left about an hour later.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.480
Understood.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.200
Madam.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.360
Please cover your eyes.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.440
I came at Second Young Master Rui's request.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.240
Is this caution still necessary?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.720
It's the rule.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.240
Please forgive us, Madam.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.360
The moment the door opens,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.320
the air rushes downward.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.720
This is underground.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.960
Please wait here for a moment.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.200
What is this?

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.560
So mysterious.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.920
Second Brother.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.440
Second Brother.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.800
Why are you here?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.200
Your Majesty, I greet you.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.360
No need for formalities.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840
It's quiet here.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.960
All the city's secrets gather here.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.080
It's truly a hidden paradise.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.320
What do you think?

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.600
Madam Rui—

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.480
No—

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.960
Should be called—

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.960
Second Young Master Nan.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.080
How do you find this Hidden Pavilion?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.840
What do you think?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.600
How does he know who I am?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.120
If I seize him here,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.600
saving my parents is still unlikely.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.960
If I take my own life—

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.680
Seizing His Majesty won't save the Nan family.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.480
Nor will suicide.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.920
Is Your Majesty here to accuse me?

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.200
I'm here to offer you a choice.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.560
A choice?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.680
To protect yourself and stay safe,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.200
living in fear at the Rui residence forever,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.360
or to fight alongside me—

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.200
become Nan Chenxiao again,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.960
and achieve greatness.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.000
Of course I want to achieve greatness.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.000
But how did Your Majesty know I'm not a woman?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.480
Do you remember—

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.200
the day your elder brother was buried?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.360
What happened then?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.480
Why are you crying?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.720
Who are you?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.440
Are you a boy or a girl?

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720
My mother said—

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.480
I'm a girl.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.880
I see.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.000
You knew from then?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.120
Why didn't you tell the late emperor?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.880
Sit.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.960
Because I—

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.120
want to see civil and military peace.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.440
Let generals regain their place.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.480
Ling An—

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.160
may flourish for another hundred years.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.800
Are you willing—

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.160
to be my right-hand?

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.160
Serve Ling An's future?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.760
I, Nan Chenxiao,

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.720
will vanquish all enemies.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.440
Defend Ling An's land.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.480
Very good.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.520
However—

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.520
Before things are settled,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.280
you must keep a low profile.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.800
I give you this token.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.640
You may command the Chongming Guard.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:53.960
I—

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.440
will not fail this mission.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.160
Enough, rise.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.120
I came today after Second Brother's letter.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.880
That's why I came to the Hidden Pavilion.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.000
Your Majesty and Second Brother—

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.400
Come out.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.000
Your Majesty, I greet you.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.040
Rui Wang has served me in secret.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.200
Now I give you the secret post.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.480
Rui Wang will handle intelligence.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.480
And in the court—

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.560
Rui Yu will oversee the officials.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.560
With this arrangement,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.040
you will work perfectly together.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.680
I—

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.440
can rest easy.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.680
Second Brother, oh Second Brother—

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.160
You've hidden yourself well.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.440
Does Rui Yu know about this?

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.760
His Majesty told me to keep it secret.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.560
But Yu'er is clever—

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.880
he found out first.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.240
Then I had no choice.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.480
Enough.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.240
Let's end the reminiscing here.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.360
I have a task for you.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.240
The Second Prince of Qian Yuan

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.520
wants to marry Princess Yan Luo.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.040
I have decided—

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.280
to let Yan Luo

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.480
leave Ling An.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.720
pretend—

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.360
Princess on the run

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.920
This is a clever idea

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.120
Ling An is powerful now

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.680
The princess is missing

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.040
Qian Yuan can't do anything

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.040
But it sounds

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.120
a bit shameless

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.040
Playing tricks on honest folks

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.360
always works

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
I have heard

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.000
the Pavilion Master is close to Princess Yan Luo lately

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.320
Aren't you planning

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.000
to help with this?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.680
Your Majesty, please don't joke

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.320
I'm just a commoner

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.960
Only because of Rui Yu

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.400
have I met the princess a few times

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.320
Enough

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.960
I won't beat around the bush

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.680
Command of the Chongming Guard is given to Nan Chenxiao

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.000
to protect the princess

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.320
And you

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440
will follow my orders

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.720
and travel between the five nations

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.240
You know the local customs best

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480
With you along

00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.920
I can rest assured

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:00.920
Well

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.680
It's settled then

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.520
The luggage is ready in the palace

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.560
The travel documents will be sent to Rui Yu

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.000
Tonight

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.760
you will set out on your journey

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.000
Rui Yu is going too

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.520
Among you all

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.280
only Rui Yu is an official

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800
When you reach Pingxiang

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.040
if negotiations are needed

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.520
she's the only one who can represent you

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.480
Though you have command of the Chongming Guard

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.760
when you're out there

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.400
you must still listen to Rui Yu

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.240
Of course

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.560
Respectfully seeing Your Majesty off

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.720
Now

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.040
we should call you Young Master Nan

00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.800
Second Brother

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.480
I have something to ask

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.840
What is it?

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.320
Does Your Majesty know Rui Yu is actually...

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.320
He knows

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.080
I have met Your Majesty

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.440
No need for formalities

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.480
Take a seat

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.040
Thank you, Your Majesty

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.160
Yesterday, I attended the lantern festival

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.000
It was truly lively

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.600
The Second Prince has always liked Ling An's customs

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.960
He hopes to visit the capital

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.960
As the old saying goes

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.440
A visitor is a guest

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.080
If the Second Prince truly has leisure

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.880
Next spring

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.200
is a good time

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.840
Even in Qian Yuan, I've heard of the capital

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.240
its splendid prosperity

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.760
And Princess Chunxi

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.880
is gentle and wise

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.160
with stunning beauty

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.440
If I could marry the princess

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.240
wouldn't that be

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:06.920
Your Majesty

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.200
Your Majesty

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.440
The princess is missing

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.200
What?

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.440
Yan Luo is missing

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.360
How could the princess go missing in the palace?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.920
Except for the Empress Dowager's quarters

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120
everywhere has been searched

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.840
Send some people to search the Empress Dowager's palace

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:25.880
Remember

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.760
Do not disturb her meditation

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.440
Yes

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880
I'll go right away

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.600
Your Majesty

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.320
Her Highness left the palace by carriage

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.800
and disappeared

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.320
Well

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.560
How could you be so careless?

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.400
Forgive us, Your Majesty

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.320
Send people outside the palace to search

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040
Hurry, go!

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.600
Yes, yes

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.800
My little sister

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.560
has always been stubborn

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.800
Maybe she heard some rumors

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.160
and thought she was to marry into Qian Yuan, so she ran

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.200
But I must return to Qian Yuan in less than ten days

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.560
That's unfortunate

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.400
If I remember correctly

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.320
the envoy should exchange documents at the Four Directions Hall today

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.040
I won't keep you

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.520
Li Quan

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.040
Here

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.280
Escort Sir Meng to the Four Directions Hall

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:11.960
Yes

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.920
I take my leave

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.080
Please

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.480
The act went a bit too far

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.080
I wonder how that girl is doing

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.760
After passing this wild forest

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.040
there are still dozens of miles to go

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.240
My heart flows away like water

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.200
Mountains and clouds are pure

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.440
But

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.200
Why does it feel hotter the further south we go?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.360
It's getting warmer

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.000
Yes

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.280
The sun feels nice now

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.280
You dragged me out of the city last night

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.040
I'm still confused

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.240
It feels like I'm dreaming

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.760
Besides not having to worry anymore

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.240
I can finally show my talents

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.120
And I learned Second Brother

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.800
isn't just lazy

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.600
All those things before

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.120
were just an act

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.560
I never pretend

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.240
You

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.240
hid your identity as Pavilion Master

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.320
and work for Your Majesty

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.520
Isn't that just a disguise?

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.200
Who says the Pavilion Master

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.520
can't be lazy?

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.560
Getting things done while relaxing

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.000
That's real skill

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.840
Let me tell you something.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.480
Yesterday, I went to the Hidden Pavilion.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.480
I met with Your Majesty.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.440
It honestly scared me to death.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.040
I couldn't keep calm.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.320
I've never faced something so grand.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.760
I still need Sir Rui to teach me well.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.600
What could I possibly teach you?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.400
I was just thinking

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.440
how to explain to the Hanlin Academy

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.280
about my sudden trip away.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.040
Don't worry.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.880
I've already asked for leave for you at the Hanlin Academy.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.840
Being away for over a month won't be a problem.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.680
What reason allows for such a long leave?

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.040
It wasn't my idea.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.040
It was Second Brother.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.680
He said I should help you gather herbs.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.880
To help you recover your health.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.680
He said

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.640
it's for the family's lineage.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.880
Slow down.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.360
Rui Wang.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.520
You...

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.600
You two are a proper married couple.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.600
That reason isn't too much.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.600
Why have you been scratching since earlier?

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.440
Are you uncomfortable?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.840
It's nothing, just...

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.080
Let me take a look.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.920
It should be fine.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.360
Just a mosquito bite.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.280
Liang Jin.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.480
Go get the ointment.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680
Yes, Sir.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:51.920
Here you go, Sir.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.280
Don't move.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.440
That should be fine now.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.840
I-I'll let Second Brother help apply it.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.520
It's not proper for me to do it, right?

Just help me apply it.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.880
Alright, alright.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.280
Hurry, hurry.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.360
Madam, she is...

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.920
Sir, you are...

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880
Come help me quickly.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.600
Just this spot.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.080
