00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.480
What happened?

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.935
Madam Lin really has
her heart set on you.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.119
She can't even
leave you alone for a minute.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.479
When she went out to look for you,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.440
the mahjong table collapsed
when she bumped into it.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.680
It hurts.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.519
Why not have
the family doctor check you out?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.679
You could have a fracture.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.800
Never mind.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.800
We'll take our leave.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.199
Why did you bring me here?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.760
To let you enjoy a good show.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.032
(Wedding)

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:19.675
Madam, do you know

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.639
what actors fear most onstage?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.599
Most people think it's messing up lines
or missing their mark.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.880
Wrong.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.039
It's the audience.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.119
The ones who can't tell
the show from real life.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.960
People like you.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.439
When you watch "Twin Fates",

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.520
are you sure you won't
get carried away?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.159
A beautiful moment
wasted on the wrong person.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.359
A heart given to the wrong man.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240
Does this wedding scene

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.399
look familiar to you?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.440
A hatred so deep
you can't even put it into words.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.039
A stolen life
never truly belongs to you.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.040
And on the road
to the underworld, no one cares.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.360
This is the unfaithful-man routine.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.480
Do you still know it by heart?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.039
It's just a story.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.400
Why take it seriously?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.680
What's the hurry?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.160
The good part's just starting.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.080
Take a guess. Where do you think
his next blade will land?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.679
You know your theater.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.919
Why not become a storyteller?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.239
Nice idea.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.080
I'll perhaps write something
like "The Substitute Bride",

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.039
a lonely ghost
stealing someone else's life.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.039
What do you think?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.199
Where's all that deep love
supposed to be?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.679
It's nothing but fake affection

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.600
at the cost of a life!

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.559
Why panic?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.439
The show is getting so good,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.960
and you're not watching anymore?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.519
Who stands before the court?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.439
A woman of the Liang family
from Rong City.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.519
I ask you this.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.559
Why do you refuse to reincarnate?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.999
I was wronged.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.599
I was abandoned by a faithless man.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.239
He even dragged my father to his death.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.920
I carry that guilt.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.599
Bold of you, girl.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.559
You forced yourself
into someone else's body.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.639
You should climb the Mountain of Blades

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.159
and boil in the Oil Cauldron.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.279
If I can take my revenge,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.760
I will gladly never be reborn.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.439
Have some tea and breathe.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.120
Madam Xu Yin.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.679
I don't like bitter tea.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.960
Bitter?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.559
This tea is called "Soulcaller".

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.720
It cures the habit
of playing deaf and mute.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.982
(Book of Life and Death)

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:31.586
(Book of Life and Death)

00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:33.591
(Liang Wenbin. Stabbed
through the chest. Died on the spot.)

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:35.752
Madam, does this name look familiar?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.959
Your skill at checking
household records

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.319
is far better
than your taste in theater.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.799
It's nothing compared to your acting.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.279
Why don't you teach me

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.902
what it feels like

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:56.583
to act like the dead while still alive?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.320
It's time to end Act Three.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.760
You write it.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.839
If you knew who I was from the start,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.159
why put me through this?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.319
Put you through this?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.264
I'm teaching you.

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:15.199
Before you take revenge,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.240
you must cut out your weakest spot.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.679
Do you know

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.120
that with a single squeeze of my finger,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.600
you won't get the chance
to avenge anything?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.960
I won.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.639
How did you know my gun was empty?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.759
Because I knew
you didn't want to kill me.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.319
And why wouldn't I?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.599
You know the reason.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.479
I planted the bomb at the wedding,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.519
but you let me frame Ruyi for it.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.159
Back at the Liang house,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.599
you left that gun on purpose to test me.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.599
You just wanted to see
whether I'd lose control

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.959
and kill Song Zhichu.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.119
You knew I was Liang Yi,
yet you didn't kill me.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.399
You didn't even use me
to bargain with Song Zhichu.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.080
So I figured you must have a plan.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.920
And I can help you.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.079
You really are Liang Wenbin's daughter.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.480
Sharp as a knife.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.120
Takes one to know one.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.960
Since we both want to
deal with Song Zhichu,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.920
why don't we work together?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.400
And why would I work with you?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.400
Liang Wenbin deserved more than death.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.280
How dare you insult my father.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.399
Sir, feel my body.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.600
It's more intoxicating than opium.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.519
Sir.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.480
I just want money
to buy a little smoke.

00:08:07.762 --> 00:08:09.682
I'll do whatever you want.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.480
You elites...

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.400
Even your bones are soaked in poison.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.119
If you want to live, get out.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.240
You...

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.000
Rong City's opium ban
filled the streets with scums.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.560
A real act of “merit,” isn't it?

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.510
But if the Liang family
was the true culprit,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.279
this blood is on your hands.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.120
Can you really wash it clean?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.559
Have you never wondered
what your father was doing?

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.600
Rong City is crawling
with opium-fed monsters,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.080
all thanks to your Liang family.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.319
Father.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.960
Why are you still up this late?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.749
I have old debts that need sorting.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.959
You're up late too.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.600
Why aren't you asleep?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.440
Why does the room smell strange?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.799
Does it?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.640
I don't smell anything.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.800
(Impossible.)

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.040
(My father would never
do something like this.)

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.039
My father hated opium
more than anything in his life.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.559
I know he would never
do something like that.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.119
It was Song Zhichu.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.440
He framed my father.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.960
Framed?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.240
If you ask me,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.839
Liang Wenbin and Song Zhichu
were just playing roles.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.119
One banned opium,
while the other sold it in secret.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.120
In the end,
they fought over the profits,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.760
and your father became the scapegoat.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.759
Was your father foolish enough
to let himself be used,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.080
or greedy enough to get himself killed?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.839
Deep down,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.760
you must have a sliver of doubt.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.919
Even if my father was
blind to the truth,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.720
I'll gouge out
Song Zhichu's eyes myself.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.279
If all you want is
to watch me fall apart,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.119
you can run to the Song family now
and claim credit.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.000
But if you trust me just once,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.160
we can work together

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.080
to find Song Zhichu's weak spot.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.250
And why would I work with you?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.079
Because I'm the eldest daughter
of the Liang family.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.719
The Liang family?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.720
You really think
that makes you valuable?

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.600
After what Song Zhichu did to me,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.760
I'll do anything.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.799
But I will never allow

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.000
anyone to insult my father.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.920
Angry now?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.519
Tomorrow, you're going somewhere.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.360
You'll see how many people
smoke opium every day,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.760
and it's all thanks to your father.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.040
Remember.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.400
If you want to work together,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.861
learn to keep yourself alive first.
