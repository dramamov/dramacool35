00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.540
There are two forks ahead.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.940
One leads to Suzhou.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.340
Your Excellency took this way last time.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.820
The route is a bit winding,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.820
but it is mostly official roads.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.300
The other leads to Jingzhou.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.980
We could exit the pass via Jingzhou today.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.100
It’s just that the paths twist more.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.380
Young Master.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.500
From my experience,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
entering the pass via Suzhou is better.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.460
Last time I returned to Ling An,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.420
I found a route

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.660
that isn’t marked on any map.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.420
Go and ask Yu'er later.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.980
If she thinks it will do,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.220
I’ll ride in front and lead.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.300
Yes.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.140
My lady—

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.980
oh, no, Young Master Nan.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.140
You…

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.220
Calling me that all of a sudden

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.620
still feels a bit awkward.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.420
Then I’ll…

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.660
You may withdraw for now.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.580
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.900
Are you upset with me?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.340
No.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.140
There’s really nothing

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.460
between me and that little princess.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.060
I know.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.700
I’m just a bit tired.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.420
Don’t overthink it.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.180
The fact you care how I feel

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.220
already makes me happy.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.260
Then of course I should treat you—

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.620
Your subordinate has news to report.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.340
What is it?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820
We planned to take the same route as before,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.180
but Second Young Master Rui said

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.340
he knows of a side road

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.660
and suggests we exit via Suzhou.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.940
Second Brother knows more than I do

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.180
about dealings between our states.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.860
If he’s more confident in that way,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.180
then let him guide us.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.660
Is everything packed?

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.820
We can depart at any time.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.180
Then we leave in a quarter-hour.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.980
Yes.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.220
Fall in!

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.620
Route change.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.940
We’ll take side roads in Suzhou.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.580
Chongming Guard, be on standby.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.780
Guard the carriages at all times.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.540
No mistakes are allowed.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.380
Is that clear?

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.340
Yes, clear!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.820
You’re up quite early today.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.220
I don’t want to go to Pingxiang.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.060
Take me back instead.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.420
All right.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.180
I mean back to Ling An.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.020
I heard you clearly.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.420
If you want to go back, we go back.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.100
You…

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.140
You don’t object?

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.220
You’re a princess.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.780
As long as you cover for us,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.580
we’ll do whatever

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.660
you tell us to do.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.820
Fine then.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.820
Go tell them right now

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.660
to send me back.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.860
I’m just a commoner.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.980
I can’t order those big shots around.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.740
Your Highness, tell Yu'er yourself.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.460
Just say you want to return to Ling An,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.060
that you wish a marriage alliance in Qian Yuan.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.580
You’re His Majesty’s own sister anyway.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.380
His Majesty will surely find a way.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.980
If that doesn’t work,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.580
we’ll think of a second and a third.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.780
Someone will always find a way for you.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.820
I…

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.740
I’m not nearly that spoiled.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.460
All right then.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.660
I was just being impulsive.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.740
Can’t you at least coax me a bit?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.660
Your Highness.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.900
Who you like is your own business,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.500
but you cannot expect them to feel the same.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.980
Of course,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.500
if you want to force a marriage
by being a princess,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.060
then just pretend I never said this.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.140
But you don't look like someone
who would.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.580
Otherwise,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.700
would you have chased Rui Yu
all these years?

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.780
You talk like you know me so well.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.460
Aren’t all the princesses in stories
like that?

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.380
Beautiful and kind at heart,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.300
they just never relent
with their tongue.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.180
Then tell me, what should I do

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.860
so that they will like me?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.820
Why do you have to turn into

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.060
the kind of person they like?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.900
Someone will like you
just as you are.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.300
Who would that be?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.100
Maybe he just hasn’t shown up yet.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.900
But you must believe
he does exist.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.060
He will like you,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.500
respect you and understand you,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.700
and accept everything about you.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.700
And you, because you like him,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.660
will do the same for him.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.740
Because of love,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.780
you’ll respect, accept,
and understand him.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.380
I don’t really understand it,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.780
but I’ll try my best.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.460
Thank you for telling me all this.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.540
Come on, we should get going.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.660
Master.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.300
Master.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.780
Master.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.940
Pretending not to hear again.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.220
Master!

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.420
I’m here.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.580
You scared me to death.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.340
I’m fishing here.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.540
Don’t scare the fish away.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.140
You didn’t even bait the hook.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.540
You won’t catch anything
even if I’m quiet.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.700
This is called “willing fish
take the hook.”

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.060
Whether they bite or not,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.860
that depends on the fish.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.580
Oh, come on.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.580
There aren’t any fish
in this pond.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.220
You’re just freeloading off
the old man’s fish.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.860
Master,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.860
could you stop fishing
for a moment?

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.620
What for?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.980
I brought a friend here.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.780
We’d like you to write
a prescription for him.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.500
His mother’s illness is a lot
like Madam Nan’s.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.540
He hopes you can write
a prescription.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.220
The patient isn’t here,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.700
I can’t take her pulse,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.740
how am I to prescribe medicine?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.220
His mother is ill
and cannot come.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.700
Didn’t I describe Madam Nan’s pulse
to you too?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.780
Just listen to him describe it.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.460
I’m fishing.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.500
Honestly…

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.980
Do you want to eat grilled fish?

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.180
Sure.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.700
Darn it, I’ll borrow a fish
next door.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.620
Wait here for me.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.340
Greetings, sir.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.260
Young friend,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.140
you came uninvited—

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.220
isn’t that improper?

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.140
I mean no offense by it.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.620
My mother’s condition at home
is urgent.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.500
I beg your understanding, sir.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.780
What is your mother’s surname
and given name?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.980
I have never treated
any nameless patient.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.980
My mother’s name is not something
I can reveal for now.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.620
If you cannot say,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.980
then I cannot treat her either.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:00.900
Sir…

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.500
Please, sir,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.900
reconsider and grant me this favor.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.340
We'll reach Suzhou City very soon.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.500
How long till we clear the gate?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.940
If we don't stop to rest,

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.380
we'll reach Pingxiang by nightfall.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.180
Princess.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.180
Shall we stay one night in Suzhou?

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.460
I'm not tired.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.620
Brother Chenxiao and the others are tired.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.780
Brother Chenxiao,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.460
shall we spend the night in Suzhou?

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.780
We should enter Pingxiang quickly.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:12.900
Once we get there,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.220
we can stay at a post house.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.100
Is that all right, Yu'er?

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.780
I'm fine with...

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.380
All right then.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.620
We'll do as Brother Chenxiao says.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.380
Let's keep going.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.820
Still haven't caught any?

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.900
That old man caught lots of yellow croaker.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.060
We can have fried fish for lunch.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.940
What's wrong?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.100
I think it's messed up.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.100
The old man won't prescribe for you?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.140
It's fine.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.900
We'll treat it as a walk in the hills.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.340
Later I'll help you eat all his food

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.260
and drink all his wine.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.620
No.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.940
I was the one being rash.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.900
You—

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.220
You can't catch fish anyway.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.140
Go help tidy up the kitchen,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.380
and prep some side dishes.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.020
You anger your master like this—

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.260
won't he really be mad?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.700
My master has a stubborn temper.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.020
That's why I told you

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.620
to spare at least half a month.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.940
Who knows when he'll get it in his head

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.820
to refuse to treat you.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.460
If you stay here with me

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.140
and wait him out a bit,

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.380
he'll cool off.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.940
You're right.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.460
Sincerity moves people.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.580
Let's catch a few more fish by the river

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.620
and pick some vegetables.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.620
Okay.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.700
Should we add another layer?

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.820
Brother Chenxiao,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.820
let's go out and play.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.380
Enough.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.940
I'm a bit tired today.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.900
Let Second Brother go with you.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.460
All right.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.580
Can't you see they need to talk?

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.100
Come on,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.260
I'll go out with you.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.820
What do you need to discuss?

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.260
Is there anything I can't know?

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580
Princess, for now

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.820
you shouldn't call Chenxiao by name.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.940
There are many eyes in Pingxiang.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.380
We must be cautious.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.260
Then what should I call him?

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.700
He's the head of the guards now.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:06.700
You two...

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.220
shouldn't act too close either.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.780
All right.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.940
For the head guard's safety,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.940
I'll be careful.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.420
Wicked fox,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.780
can you play cuju?

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.060
Entertainment for the bored,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.380
fishing or cuju—

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.820
if it makes people laugh,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.140
there's nothing I can't do.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.580
Come on,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.700
teach me cuju.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.260
Outside they're all watching us.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.940
So...

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.580
let's play this instead.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:37.940
Here, take this.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.020
What is this?

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.500
Can I eat it?

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.340
N-no, it's not for eating.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.140
I'll make one for you.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.700
Watch closely.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:02.580
Here, hold this.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.940
Master, how can you be like this?

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.460
I caught you a few more fish.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.580
I'll stew them for lunch, all right?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.940
Give me back my fishing rod!

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.380
Go wherever you like.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.700
You—

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.780
Miss Qiao, climbing the wall again?

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.700
You think that could stop me?

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.060
Choosing not to use the front gate

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.780
makes you no better than a thief.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.500
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.940
You knew, yet you still came?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.780
Go, go, go.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.780
You’ve been tired all day.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.580
Go rest for a bit.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.820
Who allowed you to come in?

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.940
You cannot live here.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.500
My father and I built a side room.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.060
He’ll stay there.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.020
We don’t need your consent.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.460
No matter who built it, no.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.780
You just can’t live here.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.820
Then go tell my father.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.020
Fine.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.940
Fine.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.340
If you stay,

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.460
then I’ll leave.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:34.860
Sir.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.860
Let’s go and talk to him.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.060
That depends

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.460
on how you perform.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.540
On how I perform?

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.820
My dear disciple drove him off.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.460
You, an outsider, coax him back.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.100
With the two of you compared,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.940
he’ll think you’re decent enough.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.660
Maybe

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.300
he’ll agree to treat your mother.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.580
So this is for my sake.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.700
Not entirely.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.460
The old man can be infuriating.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.820
I can’t help talking back.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.580
Miss Qiao, please tell me

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.340
about your master—

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.580
his temper and his likes.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.180
My master, well,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.540
claims to be without desire.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.820
But he’s greedy for good food.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.820
He also tinkers with gadgets.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.780
The waterwheel, the field fences

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.700
behind the hill are his work.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.460
They’re quite amazing.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700
I’ll show you tomorrow.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.460
That does sound

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.700
rather interesting.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:28.540
Come.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.420
Let me help you.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.700
All right.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.260
Before this trip,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.340
Second Brother sent me word.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.260
Qian Yuan wants to increase

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.740
its grain trade with Pingxiang.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.140
The amount

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.460
matches that with Ling An.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.740
They’re trying to break

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.780
the alliance of Pingxiang and Ling An.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.780
On this journey,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.380
you’re to guard Princess Yan Luo
as she flees an unwanted marriage.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.020
But in fact, Your Majesty

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.980
gave me an order.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.580
I’ve been thinking

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.580
how to break this situation.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.380
Yet no fitting plan came to me.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.780
Not until I came to Pingxiang

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.580
did I get an idea.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.340
Just…

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.020
Move.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.740
As long as it stays balanced,

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.260
it can keep spinning on its own.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.020
So what is it?

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.740
I can do it too now.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.460
Look.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.500
I want to see the Prince of Pingxiang

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.900
and forge a new pact with him.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.620
Wicked fox, you’re so clever.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.020
Hou Qi will surely meddle in this.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.620
So we must find a way

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.260
around that powerful Regent.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.100
We’ll pass word to Hou Xian.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.020
So you have a plan.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.140
Didn’t I bring a capable man?

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.580
Tomorrow

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.260
we’ll know the result.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.020
Master Yu.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.020
Master Yu.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.900
There’s a bit of trouble.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.500
The water—

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.740
the waterwheel seems

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:25.900
to be broken.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.380
I know a little

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.260
about the Mechanical Arts.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.260
Would you let me try?

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.780
If I mess it up,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.020
I’ll buy you a new one.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.100
It’s broken anyway.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.220
Go ahead and try.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:49.860
All right.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.420
Looks like

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.940
it can run again now.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.500
What's your name?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.780
My surname is Lin.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.620
I'm Lin Yan.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.020
Lin Yan.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.500
Where do you serve?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.740
I am at

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.140
the Hanlin Academy as Academician Lecturer.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.220
Academician Lecturer.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.460
Fourth rank.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.260
Yes.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.620
The post is not high.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.780
Our court's civil and military clash.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.620
How did you meet Youyi?

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.260
Our current Your Majesty made Rui Yu

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.220
and Nan Chenxiao

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.260
I want to know

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.660
what happened between you and Youyi.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.260
Rui Yu and I are good friends.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.900
By chance,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.340
I had the luck to meet Miss Qiao.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.660
I'll give you three days.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.540
All right.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.180
Memorize every herb written here.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.740
Thank you, sir.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.060
Master.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.060
The meal is all ready.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.940
Where are you off to?

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.820
There's fine wine, want some?

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.700
Well?

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.340
Master wants me, in three days,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.460
to learn this whole herb book.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.980
Then there's hope.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.620
Don't worry.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.500
I'll help you.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.220
Are you two done yet?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.740
Talk, talk, talk.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.500
I'm starving here.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.740
Are you eating or not?

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.260
Yes, yes, coming, Master!

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.500
With good wine and dishes too.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.300
Prince.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.260
King watched a street show today

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.540
then went back to read.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.860
A street show?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.700
Yes.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.140
Each month Prince calls performers in.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.340
Anything unusual?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.420
Nothing so far.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.860
What about Rui Yu and them?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.660
They returned at dusk

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.780
and went to their rooms.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.620
Seems the travel exhausted them.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.940
Go see if they are up.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.580
I will meet them myself.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.660
Yes, Prince.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.820
Who is it?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.100
It's me.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.860
I have something to tell you.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.820
May I speak with you a bit?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.860
It's already late.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.620
If Your Highness has words,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.260
say them tomorrow instead.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.620
I want to say them now.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.780
Give me a quarter hour.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.540
I want to ask you something.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.180
Since you are a general,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.420
and I am a princess,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.540
how could you possibly not like me?

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.100
What does Your Highness

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.300
think “liking someone” means?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.380
Liking someone

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.700
means you’re happy to see them,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.100
you really want to talk to them,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.180
you want to tell them everything.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.820
That’s all the storybooks say.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.100
So Your Highness’s feelings for me

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.660
are only because the storybooks write

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.860
about a general and a princess.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.860
If the storybook instead wrote

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.260
that the princess marries in alliance

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.940
and is sent far away to a Prince,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.060
would you be willing as well?

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.180
Marry far away to a Prince…

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.140
So what you felt for Rui Yu before
was the same.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.060
The “liking” you speak of is not real.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.660
It only comes from an illusion

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.940
someone else built for you.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.300
I…

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.700
It’s not like I like just anyone.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.060
You and Brother Yu are both
people I know.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.380
Because I understand you both.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.420
What is it that you understand
about us?

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.100
Do you know what I like to eat,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.140
what I like to do?

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.300
Do you know what books Rui Yu
likes to read?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.180
Give it some time,

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.700
I’ll find out sooner or later.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.700
I know Your Highness is pure
in nature,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.580
and kind.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.940
To be liked by Your Highness

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.300
is a blessing over three lifetimes.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.060
But…

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.660
there is already someone I like.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.020
Don’t tell me it’s…

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.580
the person I’m thinking of?

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.100
I don’t know who you’re thinking of.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.620
In any case, Your Highness,

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140
I do not like you.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.820
And the way you like us

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.100
is nothing but make‑believe.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.860
When you can step out of
those storybooks

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.620
and truly like a real person,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.620
that will show your true heart.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.860
Step out of storybooks…

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.060
Your Excellency Rui.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.420
Your Excellency Rui.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.820
The Regent has summoned
the officials

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.100
to enter the palace for council.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.140
He ordered your subordinate
to fetch you.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.060
You will have audience tomorrow.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.940
Your Excellency Rui,

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.620
I shall receive you in person.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.340
Your Highness.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.380
I am grateful for Your Highness
Hou’s favor.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.460
Since the princess and I visit
Pingxiang,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.660
we should of course greet
the Prince of Pingxiang.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.540
Please convey my reply.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.100
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.940
Then, Your Excellency Rui,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.140
we shall meet in court tomorrow.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.420
What is Hou Qi

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.940
scheming for?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.860
Tomorrow I will enter the palace with you.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.180
Drink.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.180
If you won't drink, I will.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.060
Princess.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.180
Stop drinking.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.300
We’re not drinking anymore.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.340
Leave me alone.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.340
I’m drinking.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.460
You can’t drink, yet you drink so much.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.260
Princess.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.380
Aren’t you asking for trouble?

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.820
Then you drink.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.860
We’re done drinking.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.660
Change clothes and sleep, all right?

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.620
The princess is really drunk.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.820
Shall we get a maid to look after her?

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.380
What’s wrong with me liking storybooks?

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.820
Is it wrong to like the one I like?

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.860
None of you likes me.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.180
Many people still like you.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.300
No one likes me.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.780
Princess.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.460
Princess.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.860
Brother Yu doesn’t like me.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.620
Let’s stop making a scene.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.300
You don’t like me either.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.340
Princess.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.340
Let’s stop now.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.860
Give it back.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.380
Stop it.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.540
Stop it.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.780
Shall I fetch these herbs for you?

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.700
Princess, let’s stop this.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.100
All right, we’ll stop.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.540
Come, lie down.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:50.820
All right, all right.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.780
I still want to drink.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.380
Sleep, sleep.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.540
The guards outside are tight.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.860
They’re watching us.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.580
Are you confident

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.100
you can get me to see Hou Xian?

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.020
Trust me, I handle things well.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.900
The token has been sent to the palace.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.780
Tomorrow

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.940
we’ll know the outcome.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.860
Go back and sleep well tonight.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.820
Tomorrow

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.100
will be another tough battle.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.300
I’ll keep watch by you with my sword.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.620
Nothing will happen.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.180
Imperata cylindrica,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.020
leaf sheaths cluster at the stem base,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.020
stem leaves are narrow and linear,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.300
soft hairs at the leaf base,

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.700
lower part narrows, texture firm,

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.580
tip sharpens, forming a spine.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.580
Wash clean and moisten slightly,

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.340
cut and dry it,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.860
remove scraps to make Imperatae Rhizoma.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.860
Stops vomiting, checks nosebleeds,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.260
treats cold damage retching,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.620
lung heat with rapid wheezing,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.900
edema and jaundice,

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.020
and relieves alcohol poisoning.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.700
The sun was harsh, you must be thirsty.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.020
Thank you.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.300
Have a rest.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.860
Aunt Wang gave me two eels today.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.700
You’ve worked hard gathering herbs.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.700
Let me nourish you a bit.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.820
Before Master Yu went into the mountains,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.620
what did he do?

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.780
I heard from Uncle Nan

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.940
my master was a strategist for the late emperor.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.420
But he’s poor at socializing,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.300
so few in the army knew of him.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.940
Later,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.340
the generals suffered calamity,

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.700
and he fled to the mountains.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.260
He never came down again.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.620
Between her and me,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.660
there is always this barrier

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.860
we cannot cross.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.340
After Rui Yu married Nan Chenxiao,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.820
it did seem to ease civil–military ties

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.420
at court a little.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.860
Maybe.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.100
Anyway, I think no civil official is good.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.660
Your Majesty

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.860
must be just like his father,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.260
head full of schemes.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.820
Always fearing generals will seize power.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.860
If he isn’t like you think,

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.340
and wants better civil–military ties?

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.020
If he truly wanted to mend those ties,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.780
my father wouldn’t be jailed for nothing.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.860
Let’s drop this topic.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.620
Come on, let’s go.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.020
I’ll take you further ahead.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.860
To see some uncommon herbs.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.020
Let’s go.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.300
This foxtail grass here

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.860
clears heat, dampness, and swelling.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.100
Shepherd's purse is edible,

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.580
and treats red, aching eyes.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.900
As for Cang'er,

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.580
almost every part can be used.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.420
Its root relieves erysipelas.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.180
It also treats dysentery.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.340
Its stems and leaves

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.700
can ease dizziness and vertigo.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.860
And its fruits

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.380
treat nasal congestion and runny nose,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.700
and soothe gout, chills, and dampness.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.900
You could say the whole plant heals.
