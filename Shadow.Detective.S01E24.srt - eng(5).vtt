Is now really the time
to discuss that, Director Huo?

Who else could it have been?

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.770
Tang Jiahao wiped out
the entire Zhuo family—

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.250
you ordered that too, didn't you?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.510
I wouldn't say that.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960
Let's just say...

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.200
he's very good...

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.320
at anticipating my wishes.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.530
You were also the one

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.410
who leaked information
about Huang Kaiyuan...

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.630
to Tang Jiahao, weren't you?

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.360
Huang Kaiyuan...

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.000
If you two hadn't thought of
sending me to him...

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.550
I really wouldn't have known where he was.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.290
Maybe he really could've escaped.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.850
So tell me—

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.060
was that heaven's help,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.850
or help from you two?

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.910
Where is Tang Jiahao now?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:22.870
What?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.160
I'm asking you where Tang Jiahao is now.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.120
I don't know either.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.250
However...

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.440
he'll probably come looking for you.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.740
No matter where he escapes to,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.590
we will bring him to justice,

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.220
and he will face punishment alongside you.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.990
He probably won't run away.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.200
After dealing with him for so many years,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.860
don't you understand him yet?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.390
With you escapees still here,

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.120
how could he possibly run away?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.150
We already have

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.640
all those films in our possession.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.069
Capturing you is
only the beginning, Gu Sinian.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.000
We won't spare anyone backing you.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.880
Await your judgment, Dr. Gu.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.790
Eat it quickly.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.319
You'll never get to have it again.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.440
We have evidence of Gu Sinian's crimes.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.440
It won't be difficult to convict him.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.200
How's the processing
of the films coming along?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.590
According to him, the films contain

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.000
records of the business dealings
of the organization behind him.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.730
Is that true?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.000
The records show

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.460
all of Skylark Company's transactions

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.500
and client lists over the years.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.460
Surprising, isn't it?

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.720
They documented

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.210
all their crimes this way.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.730
So can we make arrests now?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:17:59.940
Not yet.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.100
The films are severely damaged,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.960
and the records aren't complete.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.530
However,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.880
we can follow these records

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.190
to locate the people from Skylark Company

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.790
and round them all up at once.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.030
I wonder if we can find Tang Jiahao.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.770
That's the second piece of news.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.680
I've already sent people out
to search for him.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.410
We should hear something soon.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.780
And the third thing...

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.190
It's regarding Jingning.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.880
You have news about her?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.640
I remember you mentioned before

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.240
that when Mr. Jin met with Tang Jiahao,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.300
they talked about a girl who escaped.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.280
That's right.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.360
Mr. Jin said at the time,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.120
"She fell down. What else could I do?"

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.880
It must be that after the factory
burned down,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.130
Tang Jiahao needed to
move Jingning quickly,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.590
so he left her with Mr. Jin.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.640
Using the abandoned factory as the center,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.040
I intend to search every potential site...

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.310
within a five‑li radius
where a person could have fallen.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.440
Because if the place were easy to find,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.640
they would have gone looking for Jingning

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.860
when she fell back then.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.400
But Tang Jiahao and his people didn't.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.810
So I suspect the place she fell

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.000
might have been a steep slope

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.860
or even a cliff.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.110
Here.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.200
Here.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.240
Here.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.830
And...

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.160
here.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.070
These villages

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.830
are all at the foot of cliffs.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.850
Villagers nearby often go up
into the mountains

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.050
to cut grass and hunt.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.480
So it's possible someone might've run into

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.880
Jingning after she fell.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.110
Of course...

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.830
if Jingning met with misfortune,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.430
her remains would also be
in one of these areas.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.790
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.590
I must continue investigating.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.680
That's exactly
what I've been waiting to hear.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.120
I've already sent
the Intelligence Department

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.780
to conduct a thorough search.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.790
The area is too large. Let's go help too.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.480
All right.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.990
Everyone, get ready.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.790

After all these years apart,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.730
there's bound to be
some distance between us.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.210
That's normal.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.510

What is it?

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.930
That day, it suddenly hit me

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.730
that we've been through

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.200
so much together.

the first time

in the interrogation room,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.030
how seriously you argued with me.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.510
Then later,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.550
how you tried to

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.450
draw a line between us at the hospital.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.060
And after that,

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.440
how you ignored me

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.750
right outside the police academy gate.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.640

I know.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.590
But I also remember

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.740
how you encouraged me again and again
in the boxing ring.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.470
And how you kept trying to
remember your past

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.870
because of my obsession.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.650

your shy side too.
