00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.238
From now on,
I'll always pay for your fare.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:15.074
As long as we go to school
together every day.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.994
But we already always go
to school together everyday.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.662
Since pre-school even, right?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.080
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.873
And when we start working,
we'll still go together.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:23.834
No excuses.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.627
We'll always be with you, okay?
You can't be alone.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.254
Why me?

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:29.358
Well, you're our friend now.
You don't have a choice.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.632
Fifty pesos worth of kwek-kwek, please.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:32.712
Who are you?

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.053
And who are you?

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:37.537
Kierra, Luna, Via,

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:39.095
and Via's best friend.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.226
Oh no, Via!

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.394
Via? Are you sure you're okay?

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.711
How many fingers? How many?

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:45.856
Ten.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.464
Oh no, she's dumb now!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.549
Where's the clinic?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.278
That girl's just obsessed with me.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.180
She's doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:57.962
What's so funny?

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.326
You've got some nerve!

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.411
I haven't even kissed anyone yet!

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.620
Here, let me give you your first kiss then.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:02.581
- You're disgusting!
- Luna!

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.081
- You're disgusting!
- Luna, that's enough!

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.899
- Yeah, I said you're trash.
- Huh?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.773
- I'm trash?
- Yes!

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.600
You fucking bitch!

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:36.986
Kino!

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.035
Kino, that's enough!

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.207
Kino, don't do it.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.960
Kino...

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.298
- Kino, don't!
- Bro!

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.157
What were you thinking?

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.556
Do you want to get suspended?

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.996
I was just trying to scare him,
I wasn't really going to do it.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.462
What happened?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.461
All right, I'll just think that
the jerk who ran off is at fault.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:15.838
Because it really was that idiot's fault!

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.006
He's a pig! Do you even know that?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.240
He started it, Kino didn't
do anything wrong.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.453
Are you all okay?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.391
Guys!

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:29.018
Oh my gosh, guys!
I've been looking for you.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.769
They're announcing the partial results

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.047
of the election and so far,
we're currently leading...

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.815
What happened to you?

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.885
Did something happen?

00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:41.356
Looks like some
post-election drama, huh?

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.119
I think your party's gonna win.
Congrats in advance.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:50.331
So, what events are
you guys planning next?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.041
There's foundation week next month.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.627
That's the one with
the yearly pageant, right?

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.795
Yeah, Miss Valerian.
You should join that.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:57.589
Ouch!

00:03:57.613 --> 00:03:58.682
Yeah.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.865
So, guys, what actually happened?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.118
Come on, I'll tell you. It's a long story.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:05.286
Let's go.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.207
How are you?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.627
You okay?

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.418
Why did you get into a fight?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.587
Look what happened to you.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.123
Does it hurt?

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:17.869
Huh?

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:23.877
Let me see.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.525
Does it hurt?

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.475
Why did you have to...

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.861
Why did you do that, Kino?

00:04:31.922 --> 00:04:33.799
What if a teacher caught you?

00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:36.416
Wait a sec.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.611
I'm good. I'm good.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.073
He hurt you. So, I'll hurt him back.

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:45.769
Good thing Sam and Sevi are
nice and didn't tell on you.

00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:49.347
When Sam found out what happened,

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.249
even she wanted to go after that jerk.

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:52.893
She wanted to throw in a punch, too.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:53.918
Kino!

00:04:54.498 --> 00:04:57.486
Don't do it again, okay?
Don't ever do that again!

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:58.817
You want me to just stand there

00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:00.842
while that jerk had you by the collar?

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.346
If I ever see him at school,
I'll make sure he regrets it.

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:13.093
Still, you shouldn't do that.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.606
What if you get expelled?

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.151
You should look after yourself.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.739
Come on, let me see.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.283
Does it still hurt?

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.390
No, it doesn't.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.203
Huh? You just said it did.

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:54.854
It's fine now. It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.557
Thank you.

00:05:56.704 --> 00:05:57.705
Hey, Via.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.667
Pa!

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.693
Pa.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.041
What happened to your lip?

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:05.182
Did you get into a fight?

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:06.584
Yes, Pa.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.787
Pa, wait. Aidan's crying, hold on...

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.683
Why did you get into a fight?

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:18.711
Didn't I tell you and Via
not to start any trouble?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.464
See, it looks like things got physical.

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:23.066
Pa, someone picked a fight with Via.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.550
I couldn't hold myself back.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.178
But Via already scolded me for it.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:30.932
Still, just don't do that again, okay?

00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:31.951
Yes, Pa.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.936
But thanks for standing up for my child.

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:38.769
Via's lucky to have you.

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:41.549
I'm the lucky one to have Via, Pa.

00:06:41.854 --> 00:06:44.690
I would actually get into a fight for Via.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.072
Arkin!

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.588
Sorry, Pa. I was just joking.

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:50.701
And the guy you fought?
Did you beat him up?

00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:52.264
Good, that's how it should be.

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.791
But don't do it again, okay?

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:55.383
Don't ever do it again.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.975
Jeez.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.001
This is nothing.

00:06:59.137 --> 00:07:02.516
His was worse, he had
one here and here too.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.593
I told you guys you'd win. See?

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:13.933
Congratulations!

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:17.895
Guys, we need to celebrate!

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.816
We're celebrating! We're eating out!

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.361
Let's celebrate Luna's freedom, too!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.115
Pres said he's treating us, right?
You promised!

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:34.011
I'm treating everyone at
Wing Zone. Come on, let's go!

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.872
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.374
I'll be right back, okay?

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.770
Congratulations!

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:42.771
Hey, Yanna!

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.505
We won! We won!

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:47.070
Well, congratulations.

00:07:47.095 --> 00:07:49.013
Hope you don't end up corrupt.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.072
Hey, you're joining the
Miss Valerian pageant.

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.017
You don't have a choice
anymore, I signed you up.

00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:56.757
Go ahead, try me.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.269
You'll see.

00:08:02.447 --> 00:08:04.048
You got nothing on her, bro.

00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:05.991
Dude, I really thought
she was gonna kiss me.

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.181
Why were you teasing her? You're crazy.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:10.865
Come here.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.556
I usually feel uncomfortable

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.082
when I'm surrounded by a lot of people.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.244
But when I'm with them,

00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:24.604
I feel really happy.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.479
Oh right, Via, don't you
have a game today?

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:27.607
Can we come watch?

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:28.901
Huh? No, you might be

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:29.568
- I want to watch!
- Right!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.319
- No, maybe—
- Let's watch!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.278
You guys might be busy.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:31.820
- You might be busy.
- Let's watch!

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:32.362
No, no…

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:33.323
- Hey!
- Busy...

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.364
Via has a volleyball game,

00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:35.657
so everyone's required to watch!

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.658
- Yes!
- Everyone's required to watch.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.522
- Let's go! Via, Via!
- Game! I'm watching too.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.871
You've got your own cheering squad.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.230
Let's go!

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.790
We're her cheerleaders!

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:49.403
- Via!
- Via!

00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.301
Go, Via!

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:54.617
All right! That's it.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.719
Face here a bit. Good angle!

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:59.038
Go, Via!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.706
Via!

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.651
Let's go, Via!

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.086
Oh my god!

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:13.036
Go, Via! Go, Via!

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:17.265
That's my friend!

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:20.935
Let's go, Via!

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:25.113
All right, that's it!

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.541
Nice one!

00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:31.045
Go, Via! That's my friend!

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.381
- That's my friend!
- What? You're friends with Via?

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.382
You're not her friend.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.675
Hey! I'm friends with Via too!

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:35.926
- No! I'm friends with Via!
- What?

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.302
- She's my friend!
- She's my friend, too!

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:37.804
Guys!

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.287
- Via!
- Stop fighting!

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.098
Valeria High on three...

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.457
One, two, three, Valeria!

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.605
- Let's go, Via!
- Let's just watch.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.173
- Let's go, Via.
- Go, Via.

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:50.648
Look here for a second.
It's a good angle.

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.276
Just a bit. I just need one shot!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.382
So beautiful.

00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:54.742
One more shot!

00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:55.884
That's it!

00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:57.238
Kino, you're confusing me.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.015
Can you stop taking so many pictures?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.788
- Go, Via!
- Let's go, go, go.

00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.331
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:08.417
Hit that ball, Via!

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.027
Imagine that ball is my face!

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.354
You're the best, Via! You're the best!

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.380
You're such a good player!

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:33.090
Oh my god!

00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:34.240
Oh my god!

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.552
Go, Via!

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.864
Oh my god!

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.616
Marry me, Via!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.159
Treat us later!

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.535
My best friend's amazing!

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.727
Oh my god!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:45.830
You're amazing, Via.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.189
You're amazing. So amazing.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.690
You're so amazing.

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:52.794
Next time, don't watch my game, okay?

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.111
You're too distracting.

00:10:54.702 --> 00:10:56.496
You're mad at me for cheering for you.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.008
You're so noisy, and
you keep moving around.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.910
You're amazing, Via! You're a legend!

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.497
That's my friend!

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.209
Congratulations!

00:11:10.374 --> 00:11:11.458
This is nice.

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:14.066
So this is what it feels like
to have someone support me

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.633
besides Kino.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:17.944
- Are you gonna keep moving around?
- No.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.154
- Are you gonna be noisy?
- No more.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.554
- I promise.
- Okay.

00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:27.096
Let me see it. Come on, just a peek.

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.081
Not yet...

00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:29.581
- It's a surprise.
- I said let me see!

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:31.691
Just wait for it in the school paper.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:33.670
Let me see!

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.171
If you actually give them
ugly pictures of me,

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.675
don't you ever talk to me again.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.455
They look good, seriously.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.732
Don't you trust my shots?

00:11:42.757 --> 00:11:45.635
Besides, you're pretty, Via. Don't worry.

00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:52.783
You're ugly.

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:56.273
I literally just called you pretty

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:58.110
and now you're insulting me?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.487
You're heartless, Avianna Diaz.

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.929
You were so loud earlier!

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:04.390
You're mad that I cheered for you?

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.810
You've got such an attitude,
Avianna Rye Diaz.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:12.565
Hi, Arkin.

00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:19.295
Such a heartthrob.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.400
They're just messing with me.

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:24.702
I think they like you.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.471
I bet that girl has a crush on you.

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.135
Or maybe both of them
have a crush on you.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:33.586
Well, it's understandable.
I am good-looking.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.306
Kino, do you have a crush?

00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:51.645
Crush?

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.067
Not really. You?

00:12:57.147 --> 00:13:00.276
None. I'm not even
thinking about that stuff.

00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:03.532
When do you plan
on getting a girlfriend?

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:06.911
Maybe when we're in our fourth year?

00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:09.962
Maybe when

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:12.984
someone actually courts me.

00:13:19.681 --> 00:13:20.691
And you?

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.802
When do you plan
on getting a boyfriend?

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.244
When someone courts you?

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.657
I'm not thinking about that either.

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.135
And no one's courting me anyway.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.120
No one's going to court me.

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.078
All right, same routine.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.634
I know you're tired.

00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:42.386
Here.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.116
He still acts like he's in grade school.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:47.761
I don't even know how
he'll ever get a girlfriend.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.954
One— Two, three!

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:52.598
You're so light.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:53.600
Kino.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.310
Huh?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.144
A lot of people have
a crush on you, right?

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:56.771
So?

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.754
But they have no idea
that you're childish.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.565
Right?

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:01.150
Oh really?

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.151
Yeah, you're childish.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.152
- I'm childish?
- You are.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.177
- So I'm childish, huh?
- Childish!

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.736
- Kino!
- So I'm really childish, huh?

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.618
Guess I'm childish then.

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:14.019
Hey, put me down!

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:15.789
She said I'm childish!

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:17.666
You are childish!

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.441
Speed racer!

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.090
Okay, we only have three weeks left

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.330
before Foundation Week.

00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:30.177
So, obviously, we're working
on a tight schedule.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:32.055
As early as now,
I want to thank everyone

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:35.725
who has helped out, showed up,
and volunteered.

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:39.229
Thank you so much, I really
appreciate all of you.

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:40.522
I've already talked to the club presidents,

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.442
and so far the confirmed booths are

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.676
the Dedication booth is one,

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.179
the Marriage Booth,
and the Horror Booth.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.157
And for our main event,

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:54.560
which is the annual Miss Valerian

00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.372
Luna and Sevi, you guys are
spearheading, right?

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.408
Any updates?

00:14:58.433 --> 00:14:59.708
Yes, Pres.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.901
The Music Club's performance
is confirmed.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.213
Via, isn't Arkin a member
of the Music Club?

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.405
Is he performing too?

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:07.841
Maybe.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.844
That's cool. It'll be my first
time hearing him play.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.220
I didn't expect him to be into music.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.180
He doesn't look like it.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.844
He looks more like a troublemaker, right?

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:17.934
But Kino's actually really talented,

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.102
and he's smart, too.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:21.795
Wow, look at you
praising your best friend.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:26.318
Anyway, we already have
the list of contestants.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:29.988
For first year, it's Helena.
Second year, Irish.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:31.406
Third year, Yanna.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.533
Wait, is it really okay for Yanna

00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.452
to join the pageant,

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.745
knowing her image in
school isn't exactly great?

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.497
That's my concern too,
because if she wins,

00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:41.875
she'll basically represent the school.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.955
If she wins, I mean.

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.712
Is it okay for someone like her

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.112
to be the school's representative?

00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:49.490
Why? What's wrong with her?

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.576
I mean, for one, she's boy crazy.

00:15:54.377 --> 00:15:55.753
Any proof of that?

00:15:55.778 --> 00:15:57.738
Well, that's what a lot
of people are saying.

00:15:57.763 --> 00:15:58.931
That's just hearsay.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:01.645
I think it's unfair for Yanna

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.647
if we don't give her a
chance to show her talent

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.674
and capabilities just
because of malicious rumors.

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.485
Pres, if I may?

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.278
I just want to remind everyone

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.388
that we're all student leaders here.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.410
We shouldn't be adding to
or encouraging toxic rumors

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:19.853
or hate trains against other students.

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:21.730
It's also a form of bullying.

00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:26.318
And that's on period.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.653
You nailed it, Sam.

00:16:28.703 --> 00:16:29.705
Your spit's flying everywhere.

00:16:29.729 --> 00:16:31.215
I'm all yours, Sam.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.033
I'll follow you everywhere.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.023
So, no more issues with Yanna?

00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:35.799
Yes.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:37.492
- Okay! Perfect.
- There. Of course.

00:16:37.744 --> 00:16:38.745
Thank you, Sam.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.041
Guys, this is for everybody.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.011
We should all lead by
example. Okay? Take note.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.731
- Good example.
- Anyway...

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:49.299
My vote for Pres didn't go to waste.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.723
No good.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.122
What's the problem?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.944
How long have you been standing there?

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:33.969
Just a bit.

00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:38.270
We have this song with
a bridge that uses the chord B7.

00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:40.005
My band mate taught me this.

00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:45.207
But it sounds kinda off.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.916
I can't press it properly.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.376
Here, on the bar chord.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.435
You really can't press it down.

00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:51.711
There's another way though.
You can do it like this.

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.572
Here.

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.008
No.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.033
Put it here.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.702
Isn't that easier?

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.558
There you go.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.769
Not like that. Here.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:06.835
Right there.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.379
There.

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.758
Try again. Strum.

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:23.977
There you go.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.191
Doesn't it sound better?

00:18:30.703 --> 00:18:31.496
Right?

00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:32.939
Okay, okay, I got it now.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:37.074
I got the B7 chords.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:38.909
Why do you look so red?

00:18:39.555 --> 00:18:40.719
You okay?

00:18:40.961 --> 00:18:42.038
Are you sick?

00:18:42.063 --> 00:18:43.773
Do you have a fever? You feel warm.

00:18:44.871 --> 00:18:47.081
It's kinda hot in this room.

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.483
Maybe it's the air con.

00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:49.759
But it's on.

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.380
No, no.

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:53.173
Let me see.

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:00.323
I'm fine.

00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:02.367
Is there something wrong with me?

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:03.600
Your face is red.

00:19:07.634 --> 00:19:09.595
Maybe… maybe…

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.537
Maybe what?

00:19:10.562 --> 00:19:12.231
Maybe we should go home.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:12.860
Let's go.

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:14.016
All right.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:17.591
Let's go.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.855
You're not leaving that behind?

00:19:26.255 --> 00:19:28.174
Luna: Foundation Week starts today!

00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:30.494
Pageant day! Are we all ready?
Kierra: Wow, you're up early.

00:19:30.518 --> 00:19:33.479
Kierra: Via, you on your way?
Kierra: Via?

00:19:33.504 --> 00:19:34.508
Via?

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:36.508
Oh come on.

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:37.926
Hey, Via!

00:19:42.084 --> 00:19:43.794
Via, wake up! Look at the time.

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:45.112
We're gonna be late!

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:46.870
If we don't make it to the pageant,

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.121
Luna's gonna kill you.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.196
What?

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:51.982
What time is it?

00:19:57.275 --> 00:19:58.313
We're late.

00:19:58.338 --> 00:19:59.381
Yeah, we're late.

00:19:59.406 --> 00:19:59.883
We're late!

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:00.843
- We're late!
- Their lunch boxes!

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:02.051
No, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:03.553
- Go shower and get dressed.
- Huh? What about their lunch

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.953
- I'll take care of it.
- Huh?

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.895
I am so glad you're here, seriously.

00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:11.582
Wait for me, okay?

00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:15.461
I'll be quick.

00:20:23.343 --> 00:20:25.040
Lunch. Their lunch!

00:20:36.282 --> 00:20:37.783
This one's probably better.

00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:40.019
There, and then...

00:20:44.954 --> 00:20:45.955
Arkin

00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:50.446
why is my hot dog burnt?

00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:52.310
That's not burnt,

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.836
it's toasted so it has a
smoky flavor, you know?

00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:57.790
Then why is my egg burnt too?

00:20:57.815 --> 00:20:59.525
Is that stoated?

00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:01.568
You mean toasted?

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:02.970
No, it's not toasted.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.550
I did this on purpose so
it's crispy when you eat it.

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.015
Right?

00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:09.118
You guys are just
making fun of my cooking.

00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:10.495
I barely even cook, you know.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.229
What if I tickle you guys, huh?

00:21:12.476 --> 00:21:13.477
Huh?

00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:15.375
You're making fun of my cooking.

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:17.168
This is one of the few times I've cooked,

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:18.552
and you're just going to tease me?

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:22.296
Hey! What's taking you
so long? Hurry up already!

00:21:22.321 --> 00:21:23.238
We're gonna be late.

00:21:23.263 --> 00:21:24.467
Okay, okay, we're coming.

00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.451
Mira, ask Papa to check on Aiden.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.574
What?

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:35.084
Nothing.

00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:36.687
Let's go.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.255
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:39.506
Ysha, have you eaten?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.341
You're not hungry?

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.150
- No.
- Huh?

00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:43.246
All right then.

00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:47.233
Via, I'll stop by the music room
to grab my guitar.

00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:48.324
I'll just check if someone's there.

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.534
They're walking together again?

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.143
Guess she really is his girlfriend.

00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.603
- Too bad, he's taken.
- Yeah.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:55.540
Are they talking about us?

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.150
They're together again.
They're always together.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:03.238
Kino, did you hear that?

00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:05.439
Huh?

00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:07.090
Nothing. Come on.

00:22:07.607 --> 00:22:08.107
Hurry up.

00:22:08.132 --> 00:22:09.634
Come on, they said someone's there.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.392
Hurry.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.312
Hey! Arkin brought his girlfriend.

00:22:15.857 --> 00:22:16.942
You idiot. She's my friend.

00:22:16.967 --> 00:22:18.177
- Dumbass.
- Okay, if you say so.

00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:19.401
Hey, don't forget your guitar.

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:22.291
Those girls earlier
thought the same thing.

00:22:23.195 --> 00:22:24.189
Which ones?

00:22:24.214 --> 00:22:25.674
The ones we passed by.

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:27.099
They thought I was your girlfriend.

00:22:27.353 --> 00:22:28.579
Are you okay with that?

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.558
Yeah, I'm fine with it. How about you?

00:22:31.949 --> 00:22:32.950
Well…

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.166
It's just that maybe you've lost
a few potential love interests

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.359
since they think I'm your girlfriend.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:41.651
Nevermind.

00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:43.553
Come on, hurry up. We're gonna be late.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.005
Let's go!

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.591
Hurry!

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.908
I still need to get the camera.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:01.731
All right, but let's just
improvise our jokes later.

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.924
Okay, fine. Just go with
whatever I do, okay?

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:05.943
- You okay with that?
- Why me?

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.052
Guys!

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.529
- Hi, Pres!
- Hey, Pres!

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:09.781
How are you? Hey there.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:12.533
By the way, we wanna
make sure the tables

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:16.144
and score sheets are
all set before we start.

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.464
Excuse me, I need your help.

00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:21.358
Is the audio okay? Did we
already do a sound check?

00:23:21.383 --> 00:23:23.628
We need to make
sure everything's ready

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:25.088
before the program starts, okay?

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:25.839
Let's go.

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.423
You guys handle things here, all right?

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:28.508
Bye, Pres!

00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:29.508
Bye!

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:30.534
We got this, Pres.

00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:34.975
You guys are starting to get
on my nerves, you know that?

00:23:35.014 --> 00:23:37.934
Yanna, just let us do
your hair and makeup.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.961
You can't go on stage looking like that.

00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:41.321
You look so pale.

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:43.104
You need a proper pageant makeup look.

00:23:43.572 --> 00:23:46.826
Yeah, Yanna, just let
us handle it. We got you.

00:23:47.884 --> 00:23:49.636
Why do you all have to meddle?

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:53.408
I'm in charge of everything
that happens backstage.

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.243
I want this event to be successful.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:58.830
So please, Yanna.
Take this pageant seriously.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:00.772
We all worked hard for this.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.591
Fine. Do whatever you want.

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.422
There's not much to do anyway.

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:08.697
She already looks good.

00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:10.597
Just like a lioness.

00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:12.940
Just make it a little darker.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.256
Yanna, where's your mom
by the way? Is she coming?

00:24:18.772 --> 00:24:20.106
How about your dad?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.710
You ask too many questions.

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.588
I feel like I should just take this off.

00:24:24.903 --> 00:24:25.904
Then...

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:29.968
Much better.

00:24:38.189 --> 00:24:39.190
Some more here?

00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:40.267
- Anyway—
- I'll hold her hair.

00:24:40.291 --> 00:24:44.253
Valerians! Good morning!

00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:48.870
How are you all doing?

00:24:48.895 --> 00:24:50.897
We're great!

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.761
So, today we're officially
kicking off our Foundation Week

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:57.808
with our much awaited event.

00:24:57.833 --> 00:25:00.794
The search for this year's Miss Valerian.

00:25:01.141 --> 00:25:03.518
And of course, before we start,
let's welcome

00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:07.064
the president of our student
council, Mr. Acel Chelvea Peña

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.465
for the opening remarks.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.340
Good morning, everyone!

00:25:20.472 --> 00:25:22.349
On behalf of the student council,

00:25:22.374 --> 00:25:25.335
we welcome you all to the
Foundation Week celebration.

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:28.693
Well, someone's taking
this really seriously, huh?

00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:31.196
Via, stop messing around.

00:25:31.404 --> 00:25:33.466
I heard some of the freshmen saying

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.784
I look handsome when I'm serious.

00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:43.184
We have prepared numerous
activities and events

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.961
that will showcase our
talents and school spirit.

00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:47.647
Bringing us closer as one community.

00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:49.839
Are you serious? Are you sure
that was about you?

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.194
You think I'm lying? I swear
I heard my name.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:55.178
They said, Arkin looks handsome
when he's serious.

00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:58.139
Really? What does your "serious"
look even look like?

00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:02.435
So, let's make the most out of this week.

00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.789
Happy Foundation Week, Valerians!

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:05.855
Enjoy the show.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:12.713
Thank you, President Acel for
that heartwarming speech.

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.591
And now, the most
awaited part of the event.

00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:16.950
Let's all welcome

00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:20.412
- our Miss Valerian candidates!
- Our Miss Valerian candidates!

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.628
You guys are really good at hosting.

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:41.433
Wait, where's Ke?
I've been looking for her.

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.619
I think she's outside doing something.

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:44.666
Okay.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:49.666
See!

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.443
Let's go, Yanna!

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:05.891
Hello, everyone! I am Helena Hernandez

00:27:05.915 --> 00:27:08.519
representing the first year batch!

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:11.814
For me, being a Valerian
means being strong,

00:27:11.838 --> 00:27:13.691
kind and true to yourself.

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:15.508
And I, thank you.

00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:31.733
She's your classmate, right?

00:27:32.653 --> 00:27:35.239
Irish? Yeah. She is not nice.

00:27:35.264 --> 00:27:38.059
And that other one? She's mean, too.

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:40.250
And he badmouthed them.

00:27:40.275 --> 00:27:41.276
Hello, everyone!

00:27:41.301 --> 00:27:42.218
It's true.

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.203
I'm Irish Gail Hermosa and today

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:47.683
I'm here to represent,
second year high batch!

00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:49.310
I'm here to represent the youth

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:52.396
and show what Valerian
confidence is all about.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.381
And I, thank you.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.551
But you know what,
Irish has a crush on me.

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.779
You're so full of yourself.

00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:04.116
I swear! She confessed to
me just yesterday.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.207
Really?

00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:12.052
Let's go, Yanna!

00:28:30.346 --> 00:28:31.902
Yanna!

00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:41.004
Hi. I'm Ashianna Kim Fernandez,

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:43.738
representing the third year batch.

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:45.282
Ain't that delicious!

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:46.992
Let me have a taste!

00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:48.017
Yummy!

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.496
Her skin's so smooth!

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.579
Are you for sharing?

00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:51.730
Give me a kiss!

00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:54.149
These guys are so rude.

00:29:00.102 --> 00:29:01.979
And I'll kill you all

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.370
with kindness.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:09.956
Oh… Kindness.

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:10.996
Okay.

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.400
Yanna looks so pretty, huh?

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.193
Of course, we're the
ones who fixed her up.

00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:22.217
Good job!

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:31.120
Good Day, everyone! I am Jewel Doria

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:34.230
representing the fourth year batch.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.196
Here.

00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:49.680
Via, is it time for the talent portion?

00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:51.664
Yeah. I think it's up next.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.796
Hey, Yanna! I heard my boyfriend
cheering for you earlier.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.924
- What?
- You've got a lot of nerve.

00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:03.486
How is that my fault?

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.510
Yes.

00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:06.971
Because you're such a slut!

00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:09.116
- What did you just say?
- I said you're a slut!

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.076
- You heard me.
- Yanna!

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.327
Excuse me, hello.

00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.246
Yanna, get ready for the talent portion.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.272
You too, get ready and get dressed.

00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:23.279
Oh my god!

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.114
I hate her.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.259
Now that we've met our candidates,

00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:29.470
it's time to see another side of them.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.889
We all know Valerians
are talented students,

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:35.166
and this segment will
showcase exactly that.

00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:37.061
Welcome to...

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:38.765
- The Talent Portion!
- The Talent Portion!

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.691
Before we proceed, I'd like
to make a few reminders.

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:44.985
Please do not make
unnecessary comments

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.779
about our contestants.

00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:50.282
Right, especially stuff
that doesn't sound nice.

00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.743
Remember, being respectful

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:55.704
is one of Valeria High's core values.

00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:56.705
Wow!

00:30:56.729 --> 00:31:01.317
Amazing. My co-host has actually
memorized the school bible!

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.255
And now, let's officially begin.

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.298
Representing the first years,

00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:08.968
she'll be performing
a hip hop dance number.

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:10.970
Let's all give a warm round of applause

00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.996
for Miss Helena Hernandez.

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:30.948
She's so good.

00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:31.574
I know, I know.

00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:32.242
You can do that.

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:33.576
- Do a sing-off.
- No, we're here for Yanna.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.577
- Right!
- You're right.

00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:35.615
We're here for Yanna.

00:31:42.191 --> 00:31:43.224
Mother!

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:44.986
Mother...

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:53.578
Go, Yanna!

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.143
Just one night, Yanna!

00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:18.622
Me too, Yanna!

00:32:18.646 --> 00:32:19.912
Dance for me!

00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:21.875
Excuse me,

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:23.918
didn't we just say that
we should all respect

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.377
the contestants?

00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:26.879
The teachers are right there on the side.

00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.529
I can report you anytime.

00:32:31.639 --> 00:32:32.890
Such a killjoy.

00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:37.114
Hey.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:53.697
She's really good.

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:54.787
A sure win.

00:33:00.024 --> 00:33:02.860
We've seen our candidates
showcase their talents.

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.525
And now it's time to hear
what they have to say.

00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:06.942
Welcome to...

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.820
- The Q&amp;A Portion!
- The Q&amp;A Portion!

00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:16.553
For this portion, candidates
will be picked randomly.

00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:19.223
Let's begin with
Ashianna Kim Fernandez

00:33:19.247 --> 00:33:20.748
from the third year batch.

00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.383
What happened?

00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:31.902
Yanna isn't here yet.

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:32.593
Huh?

00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:35.739
I don't know either, but
they're calling her on stage.

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:37.115
- Yanna?
- Yes.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.283
Isn't she here?

00:33:38.307 --> 00:33:40.067
Wasn't she supposed
to enter from over there?

00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:43.271
She's not there.

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.182
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.143
Let's call her again.

00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:05.626
Miss Ashianna Kim Fernandez!

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:25.646
There she is! Oh my gosh.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.337
What's that? What does it say?

00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.714
It says she's a flirt?

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.615
At least she admits it, right?

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:38.218
Yanna, are you okay?

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.385
Are you sure?

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.454
I wish you'd flirt with me, Yanna.

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:43.748
Poor girl.

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:47.543
You sure?

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:48.771
Are you sure?

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:49.812
Okay.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.510
Okay, Miss Ashianna...

00:34:55.802 --> 00:34:57.970
Please choose from the question cards.

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.188
Your question is...

00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:09.789
What does feminism mean to you,

00:35:09.814 --> 00:35:13.985
and how can students like us
practice it in our everyday lives?

00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:20.076
For me,

00:35:20.808 --> 00:35:26.063
feminism isn't about competing with men

00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:29.794
or being above them.

00:35:31.052 --> 00:35:36.516
Its true meaning is equality.

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:42.515
Equal respect and
opportunities for everyone.

00:35:43.372 --> 00:35:44.832
As students,

00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:51.816
we can live this out by
showing respect to one another

00:35:52.908 --> 00:35:54.785
and not judging someone

00:35:55.673 --> 00:35:57.383
based on their clothing,

00:35:58.197 --> 00:35:59.365
speech,

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:10.364
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:01.390
actions,

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:03.870
or background.

00:36:07.227 --> 00:36:09.646
And for my fellow women,

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:16.841
feminism isn't about
pulling each other down.

00:36:19.747 --> 00:36:25.128
It's about working together
so that everyone rises together.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.952
And I, thank you.

00:36:41.122 --> 00:36:42.374
Yes!

00:36:49.123 --> 00:36:51.626
But, oh my god...

00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.214
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:01.712
True.

00:37:01.737 --> 00:37:02.946
Were you the one who wrote that?

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.675
Girl, she really is a slut.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.349
It suits her.

00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.368
Yeah.

00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:08.869
Oh my god.

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.412
- So it's you?
- What are you doing?

00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:11.413
- Why did you do that? Huh?
- What?

00:37:11.437 --> 00:37:12.122
- Don't get involved!
- Why?

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:12.790
What do you mean?

00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:13.832
- What did she do to you?
- It's fine.

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:14.626
Do you have proof?

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.834
- Everyone!
- It's fine.

00:37:15.858 --> 00:37:17.711
She's the one who
sabotaged Yanna's gown.

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:19.229
- No!
- Sam! Sam!

00:37:19.254 --> 00:37:21.047
- Sam, stop!
- No!

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.841
I will report all of you!

00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:25.135
- I knew you were behind this!
- You're all so shameless!

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.553
I saw you take her dress.

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:29.038
I heard you talking about Yanna
in the bathroom.

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:31.058
Well, she really is a slut.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.018
What did you say?

00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:33.602
- Hey, stop it—
- What did you just say?

00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:34.627
She's a slut.

00:37:34.877 --> 00:37:36.379
A slut, huh?

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:46.264
Stop fighting!

00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.408
I can handle this.

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:49.448
Come on!

00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:52.246
That's enough!

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.271
Stop already!

00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:55.374
Enough already!

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:56.503
Enough!

00:38:00.204 --> 00:38:01.413
Hold her!

00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:03.799
- I will report you!
- Sam!

00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:06.033
- No, I'll report them!
- Enough!

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.578
Guys! What's going on here?

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:11.789
What is this?

00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:15.753
Yanna?

00:38:16.168 --> 00:38:17.169
Excuse me.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.355
Yanna!

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:19.272
Excuse me.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.346
You guys!

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:24.569
Calm down. Relax. Inhale…

00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:26.053
Exhale. All good?

00:38:26.444 --> 00:38:27.445
You guys too.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:28.471
Enough.

00:38:28.522 --> 00:38:29.490
Wait.

00:38:29.515 --> 00:38:30.516
Excuse me.

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:33.769
I said, enough!

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:35.771
Warfreaks.

00:38:36.154 --> 00:38:38.656
Arkin? You're involved in this too?

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.651
Huh? Why me?

00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:42.445
You stay here.

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.380
Huh?

00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:46.508
My hair, oh my god.

00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:47.591
Yanna.

00:38:47.616 --> 00:38:49.285
Stop crying.

00:38:49.869 --> 00:38:51.871
Don't mind them anymore.

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:56.375
You did great. Okay?

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.088
You were amazing.
Don't mind them anymore.

00:39:03.113 --> 00:39:05.699
I knew I'd find you here.

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.013
And now there's another one.

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.057
Just leave me alone!

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.809
No way. You can cry all you want.

00:39:13.968 --> 00:39:16.012
You don't have to hide it
from us anymore.

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:18.165
Go away.

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.166
No.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.608
We're not leaving.

00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:26.626
We're not leaving you alone
until we're sure you're okay.

00:39:29.575 --> 00:39:30.969
I'm fine.

00:39:30.993 --> 00:39:32.596
Yeah, sure. You're fine.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.972
You're totally fine. Okay.

00:39:33.996 --> 00:39:34.996
Via?

00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:37.245
Via.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:39.335
Damn it.

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:41.379
You're all crazy.

00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:45.065
Well? Do you want us
to go beat her ass?

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.759
Do you want me to beat your ass?

00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:49.345
You're insane.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:50.971
Arkin?

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:52.890
Where are you?

00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:00.564
Damn it! Who else is coming, huh?

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.042
I just followed Arkin.

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.026
Pres asked me to look for Sam.

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:06.904
Sevi, where is she?

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:09.007
I swear I'm gonna punch her.

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:10.384
Keep your voice down,
we're in the library.

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:11.344
Hey…

00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:12.701
Stop crying!

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:15.955
We all hate her, don't worry.

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.767
- Take my jacket—
- So childish.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:19.880
Use it for now.

00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:21.919
It doesn't stink, okay?

00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:24.463
Your makeup's all ruined now.

00:40:26.465 --> 00:40:29.277
Yanna, don't ever think there's
something wrong with you, okay?

00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:30.320
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:33.949
You didn't do anything bad.

00:40:33.973 --> 00:40:35.867
Right. That's true.

00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:39.329
And they're just jealous because
you did great at the pageant earlier.

00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:40.301
Yeah!

00:40:40.326 --> 00:40:41.415
When people get jealous,

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:45.001
they want to intimidate you and
tear your confidence down.

00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:47.403
Don't let them get to you. Huh?

00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:50.239
Of course not!

00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:53.385
That's the spirit!
You fight back, don't give up!

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:54.386
He's right!

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.679
Right?

00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:58.306
How about we grab food after this?

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.600
That's even better! Sam's treating us!

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:01.893
That's right. Sam's paying.

00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:03.395
- Sam's gonna treat us!
- Go, Sam.

00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:05.105
- Me?
- Yes!

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:05.898
Okay!

00:41:05.922 --> 00:41:07.149
Yeah, I'm hungry too.

00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:07.984
Let's go?

00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:09.317
- Let's go.
- Later, okay?

00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:10.527
Later, after the pageant.

00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:11.695
All right. As long as it's free.

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:12.904
Yeah, after the pageant.

00:41:12.928 --> 00:41:14.805
- After the pageant.
- Let's go.

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:17.409
Let's go, guys!

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.369
Let's go.

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:19.393
The water...

00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:21.770
Let's go.

00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:26.173
Be careful.

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:28.336
So tall!

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.820
Wow. Okay.

00:41:30.403 --> 00:41:31.244
Okay.

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:33.647
There. So pretty. Let's go!

00:41:40.537 --> 00:41:43.957
And our Miss Valerian of the year is…

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.820
Our first year representative.

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.930
- Helena Hernandez!
- Helena Hernandez!

00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.319
I hope she's okay though.

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:17.352
She looks fine.

00:42:28.173 --> 00:42:29.606
Stay tuned, guys.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.610
Don't go home yet because the
music club will be playing later.

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:35.302
Can't wait for them to serenade us.

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:39.306
Congratulations.

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:42.434
Finally, it's over.

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:44.853
Are you okay?

00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:47.898
You did well, Yanna.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.627
Thanks.

00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:53.070
You guys even fought for me.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:54.881
Of course.

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:56.508
- For you.
- But I'm never gonna do this again.

00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:58.117
My feet hurt so much.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.289
It's okay, Yanna.

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.594
You still have a chance to join next year.

00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:09.295
No way! It's such a hassle.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.816
Hey! Don't leave yet, okay?

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.174
I'm going to sing. Watch me.

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:17.696
- Okay.
- Sure thing!

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.221
Let's support Arkin, guys.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.491
You all have to come watch him,

00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:23.075
because he just might cry if you don't.

00:43:23.892 --> 00:43:26.103
I will cry, Via, if you don't watch!

00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.374
Do your best, okay? Don't be nervous.

00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:31.376
If you start to feel nervous,
just look for me in the audience.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.964
Look at me and think that
it's just like we're practicing.

00:43:35.988 --> 00:43:36.549
All right then.

00:43:36.573 --> 00:43:39.783
I'll just think that I'm singing for you.

00:43:42.536 --> 00:43:43.513
By the way!

00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:46.057
Let's eat first. Ke's already
waiting over there.

00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:47.058
- Let's go!
- Come on.

00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:47.768
It's my treat!

00:43:47.792 --> 00:43:48.769
Let's go.

00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:49.894
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:43:49.918 --> 00:43:51.313
- I'll go change first.
- It's Sam's treat, after all!

00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:53.672
- Poor you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:54.273 --> 00:43:55.983
Thanks for the treat, Sam!

00:43:56.008 --> 00:43:57.652
Thanks, Sam! You're really so nice.

00:43:57.676 --> 00:43:58.653
You're the best, Sam.

00:43:58.677 --> 00:43:59.779
Hope we can do this again soon.

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.877
You're all so loud.

00:44:00.902 --> 00:44:03.029
I'm just gonna grab a drink,
I'm choking here.

00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:04.951
This is my spot.

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.202
You're too much, dude.

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:08.246
You know what guys, for some reason,

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.938
I wanna be friends with Yanna.

00:44:10.577 --> 00:44:12.203
I think she's a good person.

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.987
But, I'm not really
good at making friends.

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.132
But don't you have lots of friends?

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.467
You talk to a lot of people at school.

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.511
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

00:44:21.536 --> 00:44:23.096
Doesn't that mean they're your friends?

00:44:23.773 --> 00:44:24.845
Not really.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.015
For me, I only consider
someone my friend

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.267
if I've shared something with that person.

00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:31.669
Whether it's my time or
you know, a secret.

00:44:33.725 --> 00:44:34.851
Just like us, Via.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.135
Us? Are you guys a couple?

00:44:40.594 --> 00:44:41.679
Best friends.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:52.257
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:43.240
No.

00:44:43.265 --> 00:44:45.392
- Childhood best friends.
- …hood best friends.

00:44:45.417 --> 00:44:46.751
I thought you two were dating.

00:44:46.776 --> 00:44:48.612
Don't worry, we thought so too.

00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:51.373
By the way, we'll be having
parlor games this week.

00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:53.416
I'm signing you guys up, no backing out.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.251
Arkin.

00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:55.919
- I'll put you in the—
- Yeah, Arkin should join.

00:44:55.943 --> 00:45:00.256
The three-legged race
and the tug of war.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.384
I don't want to. Those are for kids. Pass.

00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:03.968
Then I'll just put Via's
name down instead.

00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:05.136
No, I'll do it.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.888
What was it again? Three-legged race

00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:08.348
- tug of war.
- And tug of war. Yeah.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:14.096
Then I'll put Kierra and Via
in the pass-the-paper game.

00:45:14.121 --> 00:45:15.080
You joining, Sevi?

00:45:15.105 --> 00:45:16.815
Yeah, I like that game!

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:19.174
Pass the paper's fun.

00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:20.652
I know what Sevi likes.

00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:23.655
Then I'll put Sam in the bring-me game.

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:26.098
What about Yanna, is she joining too?

00:45:34.134 --> 00:45:36.637
All right, perfect, we've got our team!

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.002
Can I get another hot dog, Sam?

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.576
Go ahead, get more.

00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:48.662
Grab more, there's plenty.

00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:50.372
Here you go.

00:45:54.623 --> 00:45:56.041
Mic test, mic test...

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.481
Hi, we're the Music Club.

00:45:58.505 --> 00:46:01.978
I'm Arkin, I play guitar and do vocals.

00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:06.132
This is Zild on bass, Rafael on electric,

00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:09.308
and Gelo on drums.

00:46:09.756 --> 00:46:11.466
We hope you enjoy our performance.

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:20.044
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome!

00:46:20.068 --> 00:46:22.630
You wouldn't think he's
a student here, right?

00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:23.507

- Music club!
- Yeah! Good job!

00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:23.501
Is that okay now?

00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:25.837
Guys, I checked the booths earlier.

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:27.416
Everything's set up nicely,

00:48:27.441 --> 00:48:30.306
and the Dedication and Marriage
booths look really cute.

00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:31.290
Nice.

00:48:31.315 --> 00:48:32.860
Right. Even the, you know,
the Jail booth,

00:48:32.884 --> 00:48:34.152
you can see the effort there too.

00:48:34.176 --> 00:48:37.013
Also the horror one, let's go there later.

00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:40.143
And invite Yanna, her body
needs a little scare.

00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:41.978
You always tease Yanna.

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:46.482
By the way, if anyone wants to
sign up for the marriage booth,

00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.735
if you're planning to get married...

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.111
You can give your names to me,

00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:51.237
I'm the one keeping the list.

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.822
And for those of you with partners,

00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:55.783
maybe you want to marry them too.

00:48:55.807 --> 00:48:58.310
You never know, they might
change their mind later, right?

00:48:58.533 --> 00:48:59.578
True.

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.289
What if there's no partner?

00:49:01.313 --> 00:49:02.525
Don't you have a crush?

00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:05.168
If you do, I'll even help you out.

00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:08.080
Come on, let's handcuff them,
they might try to escape.

00:49:08.105 --> 00:49:08.921
Escape?

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.589
What's that supposed to mean?

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:11.883
There's no getting away now.

00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:13.885
I might get punched though.

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:16.262
I'll fight them. You see this?
Can you see it?

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:18.514
I can fight. See this?

00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.832
Excuse me, can I sign up?

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.209
Huh?

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.687
You have someone
you want to marry, Arkin?

00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:26.773
Oh wow, who is it?

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.091
Hey! Are you keeping a secret from us?

00:49:31.799 --> 00:49:33.111
Let's list them down already.

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.073
Here, a pen.

00:49:34.097 --> 00:49:36.199
- So, what are the names?
- Give it to me, I'll write it down. Hurry.

00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:37.492
- Go, come on.
- How many?

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:38.452
Sorry, it should only be one.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:39.452
Tell us.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.329
It's... it's...

00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:41.330
- Who?
- Who?

00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:42.704
- And what time?
- Hurry up.

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:44.457
- Sam!
- Yeah?

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.417
Can you come here, they
have issues with the games.

00:49:45.441 --> 00:49:46.793
Okay. Hold on.

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:47.943
We'll be back.

00:49:48.095 --> 00:49:49.087
Yes?

00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:50.570
- What is this about?
- What's up?

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:54.950
Via.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.201
Huh?

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.080
Let's get married.

00:50:51.892 --> 00:50:52.900
I'm just going backstage for a bit, okay?

00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:53.994
All right, go ahead.

00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:57.613
Ma'am, excuse me.

00:50:57.637 --> 00:50:59.198
- Yes, ma'am?
- Can I order some water?

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.575
Sure! I'll get some for you.

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:01.933
Do you need anything else?

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:28.827
Have you had your first kiss yet, Via?

00:51:31.473 --> 00:51:32.807
What if you become my first kiss?

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:35.926
Me?

00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:37.719
Have you been here long?

00:51:37.744 --> 00:51:38.868
Yeah.

00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:41.501
Volleyball practice ended a bit late.

00:51:41.526 --> 00:51:43.445
Come on, I'll walk you to the terminal.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:47.724
Kino, I think I have a crush on someone.

00:51:47.854 --> 00:51:50.083
Who? Who's your crush?

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.043
It's Pres.

00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:55.505
Maybe it's better if we don't
hang out too much at school.

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:56.298
Huh?

00:51:56.322 --> 00:51:59.133
People might think I'm your boyfriend.

00:51:59.157 --> 00:52:01.985
It would be a shame if you didn't
get a chance with your crush.

00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.038
Huh?

00:52:11.753 --> 00:52:12.921
Pres, you want some?

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:16.299
Sure.
