Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.160
How is someone like you
any different from someone like me?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.160
Do you have to carry a gun
all the time like I do?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.530
We’re all forbidden to love.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.830
Because it’s a weakness
our enemies could use to destroy us.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.230
I’m staying the night.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.860
You can’t sleep here.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070
Mr. Peach seems to be the only one

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.850
who can give you orders
or go against yours, Mr. Thee.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.790
“The One and Only”?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.500
Don’t tell me you save your number
under that name on everyone's phones.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.130
Only yours.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540
Because I want to be your one and only.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.600
The restaurant is ready, Boss.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.650
We’re off work now, Mok.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.610
Sorry, Mr. Thee.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.150
Mr. Peach sent a message
saying he’s done for the day.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.500
We can pick him up from his house
in half an hour.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.200
He said you didn’t read his message,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.180
so he sent one to inform me too.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.670
He’s anxious to the point of frantically
contacting the people around me.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.800
He must be so distraught by my silence.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.300
Weren’t you the one
who scheduled dinner tonight?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Let the feeling of missing me
work its magic for a little longer.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.259
We still have time, right?

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.800
Let’s compete, Mok.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.100
Alright.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.000
Since we were kids,
you've never been able to beat me.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.700
Did you forget that
it was our secret deal?

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.100
Clear!

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.570
Stand up!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.960
Point deduction for blue!

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.170
Blue - Red!

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.470
Attention!

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.360
Bow!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.700
Red wins!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.850
Mok,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.660
you’ll have to take care of Thee
in the future.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.940
If your skills are still
worse than your boss's, that won't cut it.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.600
I’ll practice more.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.770
Very good.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.700
Does it hurt?

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.780
I accidentally hit you.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.180
No, sir.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.950
If Dad found out our plan,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.350
what do you think would happen?

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.200
It’s our secret deal.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.570
No one can know about it.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.300
You always pretend to lose to me.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.950
Aren’t you afraid of losing your spot
as my right-hand man?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.300
You know the Master will wait
until he sees you win.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.850
If I beat you, we’d have to go one
or even a few more rounds.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.750
This way is better.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.300
If I lose fast,
we get to eat ice cream sooner.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.600
I don’t want you to be my right-hand man.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.800
I want you to be my friend.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.650
Can’t I be both at the same time?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.330
Way to go.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.230
That’s worthy of the Lee family’s son.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.940
Is Mr. Thee waiting at the restaurant?

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.340
He asked me to apologize on his behalf
for missing dinner tonight.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.800
Something urgent came up.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.700
Got it.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.170
He sent me to take care of you instead.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.100
He actually booked a place,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.070
but if you’d prefer somewhere else,
please let me know.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.200
He told me to do as you wish.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.000
Please just give me a ride.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.100
Wow, this is so good.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.740
Is this all you ordered?

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.270
More’s coming.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.440
-I’m hungry.
-Hey, Nuch.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.380
-Good evening.
-Hi.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.890
Hi, Peach.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.940
Have a seat.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.740
I thought you'd be late
because of your other plans.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.890
Why are you here so early?

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.100
Well…

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.600
My friend had something come up,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.870
so I thought I’d grab a bite here.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.780
Oh, of course.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.090
Hmm…

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.430
Are you sure this person is a friend?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.550
Is this “The One and Only”?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.050
(The One and Only.)

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.300
Keep eating.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.060
It’s nothing.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.810
(Keep going.)

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.610
I’m probably going to order more food.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.450
Tonight is on me.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.200
Huh?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.950
He’s treating us.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.050
Oh, Peach.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.730
Please get shy often.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.100
I want free food.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.340
Please get shy often.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.990
Excuse me, Supachok.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.040
I remember your name.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.730
Can I have two more of the sausage dish?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.650
Can I have the menu?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.270
How’s your business?

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.000
Is everything fine?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.050
Yes, Dad.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.970
Everything’s fine.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.350
How’s the Spring Collection going, Kian?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.750
You didn’t send me any samples to try.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.650
Only one scent is ready, Peach of My Eye.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.780
As for Peaches and Cream,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.750
I’m having the team adjust the formula.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.100
Why are there only peach scents?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.300
I thought you didn’t like anything fruity?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.270
I gave them a try
and ended up liking them.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.100
What about you, Mom?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.680
What didn’t you tell me
you were coming to Thailand?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.450
It’s a surprise.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.820
I missed you so badly, you know?

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.700
Yes.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.150
You’re so cold, Ice Prince!

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.180
Do you still have a heart?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.300
Of course.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.450
Who wouldn’t have a heart?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.360
Am I still the only one
who has your heart?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.100
I want Peachayarat to be
our new secret deal.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.510
Why can’t you answer your mom?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:01.790
Are you in love?

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.820
Do I have to ask other people?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.100
Where’s Mok, by the way?

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:14.930
Dad,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.510
I’ve never forgotten what you taught me

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.810
about our feelings and who we are.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.100
Love and friendship aren’t valuable.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.220
True love and true friends
are what truly matter.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.000
Given where you stand,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.700
it’s harder for you to find
those two things than it is for others.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.180
There you are, Kian.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.320
I want to dance. Will you dance with me?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.890
Of course,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.380
but I’m not a very good dancer.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.700
I’ll be the judge of that.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:38.850
Oh.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.780
I’m sorry, Mom.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.600
It’s alright. It doesn’t hurt.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.370
Now I believe your heart
is still not taken.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.260
Sorry?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.300
If you had a regular dance partner,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.300
you wouldn’t have missed
such an easy step.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.430
Am I right?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.300
While true love is really hard to find,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.800
it doesn’t mean it can’t be found.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.250
Sometimes, you just have to
follow the rhythm.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.810
Even if something makes you stop,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.630
as long as you’re not afraid,
you’ll finally be able to dance.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.560
Mom.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.700
What are you still afraid of?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.570
Close your eyes.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.990
Do it.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.200
Come on.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.550
Now, imagine this.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.800
You’re dancing with someone.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.770
Someone who, no matter where you step,
is always ready to move with you.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.600
Someone you want here the most.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.070
See? It’s so much easier now.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.500
And you don’t have to be afraid anymore.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.050
Actually, I invited you all to dinner
because I wanted to tell you something.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.590
Let me wait outside.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.650
You don’t have to.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.100
This kinda involves you too, Peach.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.960
Sit down.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.300
Huh? Don’t tell me…

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.700
You’re quitting.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.600
Are you crazy?

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.740
I’m not quitting.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.420
How else would I make a living?

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.620
Oh, okay.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.200
So what do you want to tell us?

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.500
We got amazing feedback
on the limited edition scent.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.720
So the higher-ups have ordered us
to start preparing for the new collection

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.260
to keep the momentum going.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.870
Damn it.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.700
That means I’m not getting any rest.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.310
I quit.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.620
Peach, please support me.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.340
Peach, please support me too.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.310
Peach, please support me too.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.450
Calm down.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.500
This is why we’re hiring
a new team member.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:29.580
What?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.680
A new team member?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.570
Yeah, we’re getting a new head
to take over the Winter project from me.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.140
Oh!

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.990
That’s great.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.800
Note!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.250
Yes?

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.990
Just kidding.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.400
So, will we be working on
the Fall Collection with you

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.780
or the new head?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.150
This is heartbreaking.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.190
Hold on, Note.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.260
Are you secretly smiling?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.770
Cheers!

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.720
Peach.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.700
The new head might be good.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.000
Don’t worry.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.060
But I feel comfortable working with Nuch.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.460
You know I don’t like adjusting.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.350
It’s just for
the Winter Collection, right?

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.660
Even though you’ll be working with
the new head, you’ll still have Note.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.100
And me.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.570
Have you signed the contract
for the Winter Collection?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.140
Why didn’t Nuch tell me and Note?

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:01.740
Did I slip that out?

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.000
Peach!

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.660
I haven’t signed yet,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.260
but I’m meeting with Nuch next week
to finalize the contract.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.200
I love you so much, Peach.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.610
Mmm.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.700
Go take a shower and sleep.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.380
Okay.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.000
Let me know when you get home.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.340
Here’s your car key.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.100
Bye-bye.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.020
How’s our secret deal?

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.660
(The secret deal is not a secret anymore.)

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.200
Do you enjoy having people
follow me that much?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.180
(Peach.)

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.580
You’re misunderstanding me.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.200
I didn’t send anyone to follow you.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.550
What do you mean?

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.859
I’m worried. Can’t you understand?

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.960
I already feel terrible for missing
our plan, it’s driving me crazy.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.970
If I didn’t hear from Mok
that you got home safely,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.400
I’d be raving in my sleep all night.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.030
(You’re already raving.)

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.700
Please tell your boss

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.800
I’m not overthinking
something this trivial.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.850
He can forget it.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.900
Mr. Thee’s parents came to visit
from Hong Kong without notice.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:40.700
He was afraid you’d be angry,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.090
so he sent me to take care of you
and make it up to you.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.290
You told me his parents live abroad
and he hardly gets to see them.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.000
He should be with his family.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.900
Just when he started to feel happy,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.850
it’s like he’s getting pulled back
into reality.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.450
What do you mean?

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.900
Handsome, can you buy all of these?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.270
You dropped Peach home safely, right?

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.100
Is he sulking because
he didn’t get to see me today?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.420
No.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.200
Not at all?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.740
Maybe he's so good at hiding
his facial expressions

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.250
that you can’t tell.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:56.780
Mr. Peach asked me to give this to you.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.400
He said he's sending you happiness.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.250
(Is this what it really feels like
when a young man falls in love?)

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.550
Is that true?

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.390
Peach didn’t give you
one of these, did he?

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.700
It’s a pandan leaf bouquet.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.370
Mr. Peach bought two.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.580
He kept one for himself.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.860
The other one is in your hand.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.550
It’s very late.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.260
You should go get some rest.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.000
(Falling in love…)

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.860
(unexpectedly?)

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.830
Mr. Mok, you said that

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.900
just when Mr. Thee seemed to
start feeling happy,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.400
he’s getting pulled back into reality.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.600
What do you mean by that?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.250
I mean what I said.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.220
Is Aran Mr. Thee’s happiness?

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.600
About Aran,
I’m sorry, I have to be honest.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.400
Mr. Thee only wanted
a one-night stand with him.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.900
Aran is not like anyone else.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.500
If what you’re saying is true,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.330
then I’m sorry.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.750
I’ll have to stop getting involved with
Mr. Thee and Aran.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.140
I’m afraid I can’t help.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.200
I know you love your boss.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.600
I love my brother too.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.620
Do you have enough love
to share with my boss?

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.950
Mr. Mok, what are you saying?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.800
Mr. Thee once asked to be friends with me,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.000
and it’s always been like that

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.300
until he took his position.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.600
We used to sit side by side at meals,
but now I have to stand behind him,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.300
watching over his safety.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:57.100
Our duties have pushed us away
from friendship without us realizing it.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.850
What are you trying to tell me?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.380
Mr. Thee has no one
he can truly call a friend.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.460
But now, you seem the closest
to being that for him.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.050
I wish you could be Mr. Thee’s friend

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.450
so he could feel a little happiness.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.200
That would be amazing.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.300
When I bought these,

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.300
the boy wished me lots of happiness.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.700
Can you share this happiness
with Mr. Thee for me?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.100
How do I even be friends
with a mafia boss?

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.500
What do I talk about?

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.400
I don’t usually have friends either.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.020
Right?

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.900
Hey!

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.400
Yo!

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.000
THE PANDAN LEAVES SMELL NICE OR NAH?

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.100
The pandan leaves smell nice or nah?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.010
THE PANDAN LEAVES SMELL NICE?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.200
Do you have enough love
to share with my boss?

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.800
I guess I’ll have to share
some of my very few friends with you.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.550
Who are you talking to?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.460
Oh.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.400
Mr. Thee.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.400
What are you doing here?

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.100
Waiting for you, of course.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.160
Huh?

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.900
I’ve been waiting for you since morning

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.200
because I wanted to say…

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:03.620
Nice smell.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.200
What smells nice?

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.820
I said, “Nice smell.”

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.000
Who are you smelling?

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.000
You asked me

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.700
if the sugar palm leaves smell nice.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.860
It’s pandan leaves, not sugar palm leaves.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.580
I texted you, but you didn’t reply.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.350
So I wanted to come and tell you that

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.380
they smell nice.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.450
You came to see me just for this?

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.500
Do you want me to say more than that?

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.800
And why were you startled earlier?

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.800
Nothing, um…

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.750
Forget it.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.530
I don’t like seeing you wearing a cap.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.400
I can’t see your face clearly.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.580
I rushed out of the house this morning
and brought this along by accident.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.460
By the way, I wanted to give you this.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:08.830
What is it?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.600
A friend.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:19.500
I noticed that

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.100
you don’t have many friends,

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.700
so I wanted to give you one.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.850
Are you friends with this silly face?

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.200
You could say that.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.170
When I don’t know who to vent to
when I’m mad or stressed,

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.750
I vent to this silly face.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.600
But I don’t have a cap.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.100
This one wouldn’t have a home.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.520
It doesn’t need to be on a cap.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.200
Now, Silly can be anywhere with you.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.870
Yesterday, you gave me happiness.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.220
Today, you gave me a friend.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.050
Have you thought about
what you’ll give me tomorrow?

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.420
I have to go. Let’s talk another time.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.610
Hello?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.260
Yes, I’m on my way.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.050
Peach gave you to me, huh, Silly?

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.700
He’s almost 15 minutes late already.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.350
He should be here soon.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.550
There he is.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.500
Hello.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.500
Hello.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.220
This is Wiwid. He’s taking over
the Winter Collection from me.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.810
Come on, Team!

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.160
Wake up!

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.520
Our model is here. Come on.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.620
Go down slowly to the mark.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.460
You see that white spot near the pool?

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.210
Slowly.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.300
Hey, guide her carefully.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.110
Alright, let’s get ready!

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.520
Yes, stay at that white mark.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.780
Camera and lighting ready?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.300
Is our model ready?

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.950
Ready?

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.300
Okay, when you’re ready,
take off the robe.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.700
Hey!

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.870
If you don’t take it off,
how are we going to shoot, pretty girl?

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:33.900
Take it off.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:34.970
Hey!

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.370
What happened?

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.250
You can tell me.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.180
Hey, hey, hey!

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.060
It’s none of your business,
you lousy photographer!

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.050
It’s alright.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.710
I’ll help you.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.000
They didn’t tell me I had to wear this.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.600
They only said this was a fashion shoot.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.600
How old are you?

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.900
16.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.590
Hey! Why the hell are you sticking
your nose in other people’s business, huh?

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.980
Just do what I hired you to do!

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.900
Stop f*cking interfering!

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.600
Not only should we stop working,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.000
but we should also talk to the police.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.550
Hello, everyone.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.400
My name is Wiwid,
but you can call me Wid.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.600
I’m happy to be your new team lead,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.800
and I’m looking forward to
working with all of you.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.820
I never thought we’d have the chance
to work together again, Mr. Peach.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.800
Alright, let’s talk about
my working style.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.940
It might be a bit
different from Ms. Nuch’s,

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.400
so feel free to take your time adjusting.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.600
What’s everyone’s name?

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.700
My name is Note.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.250
Hi.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.400
-Note, right?
-That’s right.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.800
I’m Plub.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.610
Plub.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.000
I’m May.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.900
May.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.700
Are you three full-time at ARSENI?

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:03.900
Yes.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:04.950
Okay.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.100
Since this is our first time meeting, it’s okay.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.550
But going forward,
if I ask for a team meeting,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:19.850
please understand that I mean
only the internal team.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.220
That means no freelancers or part-timers.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.800
I take the distinction between internal
and external people very seriously.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.600
Alright? I hope we’re on the same page.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.420
By the way,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:38.400
I’d like to put Mr. Peach’s
Winter Collection contract on hold.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.000
If you hadn’t stopped me,
I would’ve splashed water on his face.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.600
Please calm down.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.600
Wiwid is the guy you had a problem with,
isn’t he?

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.900
What a freaking loser.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.300
He acts like he’s so big and powerful.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.690
Be nice.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.950
This isn’t even enough for
someone like that.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.950
I could be way nastier about him.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.010
Lookplub.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.950
I’m sure he’s looking for a way
to get you kicked off the project.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.800
Why else would he put your
Winter contract on hold?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.200
I actually don’t mind
if he cancels my contract.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.840
It just means I can go on vacation sooner.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.450
Peach!

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.800
Don’t let him win!

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.620
Even though we don’t have
any connections to fight him,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.450
I won’t let him win that easily.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.800
Plub, this isn’t about winning or losing.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600
That jerk is a mad dog.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.600
He won’t stop biting me.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:02.950
Just let him be.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.000
Come on, Peach!

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.300
Plub, he’s your leader.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.800
He hates me,

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.540
so let him mess with me only.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.700
If we do anything,
you’ll be the one in trouble.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.830
But you’re my brother.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.000
Can’t I protect you?

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.680
Don’t cry.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.040
Your eyes will get swollen, and you won’t
look pretty when you go down to work.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.860
It’s okay, really.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.510
Let this go.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.250
If something is really wearing you out,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.000
just vent to Silly.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.900
How do you know
I want to vent about something?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.100
I saw you standing up and sitting down
for over 48 minutes.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.580
That’s longer than people
in a normal mood would do.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.010
Here, take it.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.060
I’m sure you haven’t had
anything since morning.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.880
How could you even watch me
in secret for so long?

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:33.710
Why didn’t I notice you?

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.699
Come on.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.699
So, what’s wrong with you?

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.050
I already brought you Silly.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.240
Thank you.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.200
But Silly probably can’t help me with this.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.600
Then try telling me.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.100
I can help you with anything.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.900
I really mean anything in this world.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.400
I know you can help,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.300
but this isn’t a problem yet.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.600
I can still handle it.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.070
Then can you promise me that from now on,

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.860
no matter what happens,

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.000
I’ll be the first person you think of?

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.310
Hey, that line’s for couples, not friends.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.400
Why discriminate?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.440
Mmm.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.600
Okay.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.200
I won’t argue with you.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.750
Let’s just say I understand you.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.450
Understand? What do you understand?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.470
I understand this is how you normally talk.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.280
Whether it’s to a friend, a partner,
or a stranger,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.500
you always say cheesy things.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.500
What’s wrong?

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.000
You talk like you’re…

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.840
jealous.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.250
Don’t be shy.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.900
Let’s just say I understand.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.400
Everyone wants to own my heart.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.300
Let’s try this again.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.430
You don’t say a friend owns your heart.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:00.660
You give your heart to a friend.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.870
But I don’t think of you as—

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:02.900
Typical overseas student.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.800
His Thai is not very good,

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.700
and on top of that,
he loves watching primetime soapies.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.030
I’m going crazy.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.090
Mr. Peach has already left.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.410
I know.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:30.500
This is Mr. Aran’s contract
for the Fall Collection’s special scent.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.750
The other one is Mr. Peach’s contract.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.350
Why are these ready at the same time?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.820
Looks like they planned
to sign together today.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.120
I think I saw Mr. Aran
leaving with Mr. Peach.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.300
Where’s that model’s paramour?

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.090
Why is he letting him
cling to Peach like this?

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.500
Paramour?

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.100
You mean Mr. Tawan?

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.100
Those two ended their relationship
a while ago.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.200
So that’s why

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.710
he’s been bothering Peach lately.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.200
But Mr. Peach has always been
very close to Mr. Aran.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.310
When I talked to him the other day,

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.750
he said he loves and worries
about Mr. Aran a lot.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.820
Go get that dog to come back
and reclaim his bone right now.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.200
Keep the bone away from Peach.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:22.450
BAAN KLAMAI CHILDREN FOUNDATION

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.890
Rock, paper, scissors!
BAAN KLAMAI CHILDREN FOUNDATION

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:25.900
Watch out. Don’t fall.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.690
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Watch out.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.730
-Be careful not to slip, kids.
-Rock, paper, scissors!

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.020
Peach!

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.570
I missed you so badly!

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.660
Me too!

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.200
Have either of you been stubborn
with Mother?

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.390
Lookpeach!

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.100
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:52.850
You’re happy, aren’t you?

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.500
Someone’s interested in adopting Marn.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.650
Did Mork already know?

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.350
What did he say?

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.060
We’re waiting for her paper
to be finalized,

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.000
but I’ll probably tell him soon.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.550
Normally, I don’t let anyone
play with my head like this.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.800
If you don’t want me to touch it,
push my hand away.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.050
I won’t.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.550
Why not?

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:23.700
I love you.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:02.200
Hi, Peach.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.570
(How’s your car? Has it been fixed?)

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.600
The mechanic said it’ll be done
the day after tomorrow.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.850
(Then I’ll pick you up at your condo
tomorrow morning.)

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.010
It’s so early.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.590
No coffee shop is open.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:26.500
I’m hungry.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.540
Here, eat this for now.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.770
Wow.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.750
You drove all the way
to pick me up from my house

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.900
and even brought me a snack.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:40.310
You really take good care of me.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.500
If we can’t find someone
in the next 30 years,

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.800
should we marry each other?

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.700
I’d be so old by then.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.010
Find someone else.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.540
Mmm.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.250
Let’s go.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.900
Those blabbermouths!

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.950
They’re rambling nonsense!

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:12.810
They want to marry each other?

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.550
What a shameless thing to say!

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.800
Mok, order 10 boxes
of that snack for Peach.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.330
He’s given his away.
What will he eat otherwise?

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.100
Yes, sir.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.690
Order some for Aran too,

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.830
so he doesn’t have to get it
from Peach again.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:45.900
Hey, Nuch.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:47.400
Hi.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.570
Hi, Peach.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:49.820
I knew you’d be upstairs.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.600
I was at the studio,
but couldn't find you.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.010
I came up to prepare some documents.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:59.350
Anyway, I’m so happy you have time to help
with our special last-minute project.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.350
It’s really last-minute.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.500
I just printed the breakdown sheet.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.300
It is last-minute.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.200
You checked my availability
yesterday evening,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.600
sent me the brief at midnight,

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:12.380
and asked me to come to set at 8 a.m.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.700
I believe it’s really last-minute.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:15.340
Come on, Peach.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.940
Don’t tease me.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.500
Let’s help each other see this
Fall Collection through to the end.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.050
By the way, do you want to print anything?

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.100
I can print a lot for you.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.100
Don’t hold back.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.850
I’m good. This is enough.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.690
Oh, really?

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:32.770
I wanted to ask you something.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.000
I saw reference photos of a couple,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.370
but I didn’t see the name of the person

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.260
who’ll be modeling
with Aran in the breakdown.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.900
He’s the reason

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.300
we’re working on this last-minute set.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.250
Mr. High-Demand Superstar.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.400
Will we make it in time?

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.000
That’s basically the concept.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.390
Please wait here.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.200
When the set is ready,
I’ll have someone come get you.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.340
Alright.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:08.700
You’re doing well?

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.050
Yeah. I’m good.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:16.820
You look slimmer.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.350
I guess so.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.600
You’re doing great on your own, right?

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:33.700
I really had no idea

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.850
I’d be doing this shoot with you.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.100
I’m sorry if I made you feel
uncomfortable.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.000
Yeah,

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.650
it’s fine.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.200
It was my manager who took this job.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.600
I really had no idea.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.200
I just have to be your coworker.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.090
I can do that.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.250
No big deal.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.100
Tawan, Ran,

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.200
please come to set.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:04.650
Come on.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:13.700
Why Tawan?

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:16.600
I don’t know.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.600
The higher-ups gave the order
out of nowhere,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.350
along with the clothing sizes
and the last-minute concept.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.700
The higher-ups?

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:26.540
Yeah.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.620
Peach, I think we should start.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.230
Okay. Let’s give them the product.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.400
We’ll start now.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.350
Let me test the lighting first.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:41.750
Mr. Tawan, can you bring your face
close to Aran’s?

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.450
Please show the product.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.000
Can you two get closer?

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.750
Um, can the hairstylist fix Tawan’s hair?

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:55.730
It’s okay.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.240
Let’s continue.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.000
Okay, let’s continue.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.050
Sorry, I’m just used to doing that.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.410
It’s okay.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:39.210
Okay.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.980
Please change your outfits.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.280
Okay.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.250
Looking handsome.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.710
Change the pose.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.410
Nuch, I think I got the shots.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.600
Yes, I think I found some I like too.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.620
After this set, we can take a meal break.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.110
Three. Two.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:02.200
One.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.700
Alright, let’s take a break.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.300
Hey.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:14.740
Did you come for coffee?

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:15.390
Honestly!

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.630
How did you even fall for that loony?

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.850
If you’re going to fall for someone,
it should be someone normal.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:24.840
Like…

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:28.900
Like us.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.820
You overheard our conversation?

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:36.450
What kind of logic is that,

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.900
saying you’ll marry each other
when you’re old?

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.740
I was just joking with Aran.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.750
Who even jokes about love?

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:50.510
Well…

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.450
Aran and I always joke like that.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.550
I came all the way here
to let you make up with me,

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.010
but you’re making me even angrier.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:07.440
Mr. Thee.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.500
What are you doing?

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:36.530
You can touch me.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.000
I give you permission.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.350
What’s really going on?

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.250
Why are you upset?

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.400
Can you stay in my sight forever?

00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:00.080
You mean you want me to be your friend
and keep you company for a long time?

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.650
Usually, when people come into my life,

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.100
most of them say I’m boring.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.000
You’re the only one
who wants me around for a long time.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.850
Am I your one and only too?

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:32.150
Hey, you should be careful
saying stuff like that to people.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.800
Not everyone will try to interpret
what you mean.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:39.630
What if I said that to someone else?

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.650
They’d probably think you were flirting
with them or that you liked them.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.490
Luckily, I—

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.050
Then I guess I like you.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.500
Why?

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.200
Why haven’t you interpreted what I said?

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:03.950
Interpret it

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:06.250
and see what it means.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.300
Boss will be half an hour late
to the meeting.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.180
Please inform the others.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.730
MISS YOU.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:49.330
Okay.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.320
Wait, your hand is blocking
the product a little.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.270
Can you show it more clearly? Thank you.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:54.650
Some more profile shots.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.230
Let’s freestyle for the last 10 shots.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.180
Eight. Nine. Ten.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.850
Let’s change the set.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.100
We’ll do headshots next.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:06.960
Thank you.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:09.900
Hey, why are you in such a hurry
to go home, photographer?

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.200
It’s not even 10 p.m. yet.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.100
Look at the composition.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.900
It’s still off.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:19.510
It looks bad to me.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.040
I understand this is urgent work,

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:30.400
but rushing this much is unprofessional.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.800
Does Wid know Peach is one of
the top photographers in the country?

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.250
Probably not.

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.250
He wouldn’t dare
give such harsh feedback if he did.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.650
The composition matches the brief
and looks great.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:40.860
What does he mean, it’s off?

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.900
Thank you for the suggestion.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:48.500
But let me check with the team

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:51.190
if today’s breakdown is
the Fall Collection led by Nuch

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.290
or the Winter Collection led by you.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.350
The breakdown is correct.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:52:00.300
I just stopped by to see
if our working styles click.

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:04.400
If they don’t,

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.800
I’ll have to find a new photographer

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:10.760
whose style aligns with mine,
as the project leader.

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.900
Peach,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.750
let’s move on to the next set.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:19.000
Yes, Nuch.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:23.400
I think the photos look great.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:32.600
Ran,

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.900
are you okay?

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:38.870
Are you talking about Tawan?

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:42.500
I’m okay.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400
What can I do?

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.150
Even though I don’t want
to look at his face,

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.050
I have to. It’s work.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:57.600
It’s okay.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:58.700
Come here.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:05.450
Don’t worry too much.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.100
Good luck finding a good spot
for your meeting.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:11.940
I’m leaving now.

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.380
Yeah, just go.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.000
No, I won’t.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:16.610
Just go.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.530
I’m off.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.580
See you.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:28.000
It’s okay. I can stand by in the morning.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:30.200
I got a hotel near the location.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:31.060
It’s all good.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.750
Hello?

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:37.500
(Have you left ARSENI?)

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.700
I’m about to get in the car.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.500
(It’s already midnight.)

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.050
Damn, I didn’t realize it was this late.

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:44.100
I’m sorry.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.070
I got carried away reading the brief
for tomorrow’s work.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.250
I forgot to check the time.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.300
(Do you want me to give you
a wake-up call tomorrow?)

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.450
(Isn’t the shooting location
in Samut Prakan?)

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.690
It’s okay.
I already booked a hotel nearby.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.600
(Okay. Let me know
when you get to the hotel.)

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:58.810
(I’ll be waiting for your call.)

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.300
Noted.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.580
(Bye-bye.)

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.240
Bye-bye.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:23.600
Are you still here?

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.050
(Suddenly, the sky turned erratic
and unpredictable.)

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.200
(so I don’t want to leave just yet.)

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.700

(and countless other microorganisms
invisible to the naked eye.)

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.650
(Bacteria, viruses, fungi…)

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.800
(Not to mention parasites.)

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.700
You could get sick from doing that.

You don’t have work tomorrow, right?

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.150
I’m a freelancer.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.900
I work for other clients besides ARSENI.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:52.850
Is everything okay?

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.650
I almost brought up money

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:00.100
and upset you again.

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:02.740
You’re doing better.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.000
At least, you realized
what you were about to say

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:07.250
would make me feel uncomfortable.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:09.100
I’m sorry.

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:10.980
You don’t have to apologize yet.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.050
You haven’t done anything wrong.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:19.300
Is there any way you could be mine only?

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.200
You mean you want me to work
exclusively for ARSENI, right?

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:35.390
No, I like being a freelancer.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.700
I don’t like routine.

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:42.250
I should go.

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.900
I have a few dozen kilometers to drive.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.000
That’s so far.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:48.470
You should take a plane.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:50.140
Are you being sarcastic?

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.100
My private jet can arrive here
in 30 minutes

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:54.450
if you want.

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:56.900
I can even go with you.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.540
I’m free tomorrow.

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:03.050
Thank you, but it’s not that far.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.400
Besides, I already booked a hotel,

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.810
so I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow.

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.300
I have condos in almost every city.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.500
I’m going to Bang Krachao.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.800
I don’t have a condo there.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.940
That’s fine. Just don’t go buying one.

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.180
Tall buildings aren’t allowed there.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:23.800
I only have a vacation home.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:25.200
Will that do?

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.950
Who are you?

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.950
I’m Theerakit Kian Lee.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:38.600
When will you let go of my hand?

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.200
I’m wiping off the rain germs for you.

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.100
This is the second time
I’ve told you about that.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.650
Don’t you remember?

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.210
Yes, I do.

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:52.830
Yet, you pay it no mind.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.350
You could get sick.

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:02.150
It’s okay.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.130
Wait, Peachayarat!

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.000
What are you doing?

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.200
Playing in the rain, of course.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:22.900
You haven’t done this, have you?
You really missed out.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.200
Yes, I missed out on getting germs!

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.300
There are hundreds of ways to have fun,

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:27.980
but you chose to be in the rain?

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.200
Don’t think of this as playing
with rainwater.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.600
Think of it as dancing in the rain.

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:39.780
Dancing?

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.060
(Sometimes, you just have to
follow the rhythm.)

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.300
Even if something makes you stop,

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:53.550
(as long as you’re not afraid,
you’ll finally be able to dance.)

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.600
Come on!

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:03.800
(Close your eyes.)

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:05.750
(Now, imagine this.)

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.800
(You’re dancing with someone.)

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:15.060
(Someone who, no matter where you step,
is always ready to move with you.)

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:18.190
(Someone you want here the most.)

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.660
(I think I’ve found it, Mom.)

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.340
(Both my rhythm and someone
who will move with me.)

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:36.300
You haven’t answered my question.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:45.200
Is there any way
you could be mine only, Peachayarat?

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:37.600
Find the most skilled team

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.940
to stuff this banana leaf bouquet.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:41.610
It’s pandan leaves.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.370
Preserve its condition
for as long as possible.

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:54.200
Mok, I’ve finalized the special scent
for the next collection.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:58.600
I’ll name it,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.500
“Secret Happiness.”

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.460
I’ve learned about your extravagant life.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.200
It’s your turn to learn about
my ordinary one.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.260
Me?

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.250
Give me a smile.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.190
The lighting is perfect right now.

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:28.920
Every time I wash my face
and brush my teeth,

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.200
I need to look in the mirror.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.400
You can look here.

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:32.360
Are you crazy?

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.610
There’s an urgent document, Boss.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.810
Why is Peach not the photographer?

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:36.770
The new project head asked to replace him.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:37.370
His name is Wiwid.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.420
Plub! Plub!

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.620
Something big just happened!

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.820
What do you mean?

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.050
What did you do to Wiwid?
