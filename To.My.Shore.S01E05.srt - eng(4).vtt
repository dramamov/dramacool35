00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.339
You Shu Lang.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.119
Director You.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.059
Great Director You.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.399
I was just running my mouth.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.139
Don't take it to heart, alright?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.960
Fan Xiao, let's go back to the room.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.520
We'll lock the windows and doors,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.034
and we won't hear the damn waves.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.059
Going back to the room,
and shutting the windows and doors...

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.699
What exactly do you want to do with me?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.460
Director You.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.119
I admit I was wrong.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.679
I won't blabber nonsense again.

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.639
I'll accept my punishment.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.960
You're overreacting.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Then give me a smile?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.839
The whole way back, I've been cracking jokes,

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.160
but you didn't laugh once.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.539
Your bar is way too high.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.119
There you go. Now, go shower.

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.720
We have a conference early in the morning.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.520
You really won't help me wash up?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.320
If this hand gets wet, it's gonna be a hassle.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.899
"If"?

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.039
I wrapped this hand waterproof tight.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.639
Unless you deliberately dunk it in water,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.979
it won't ever get wet.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.899
Go on.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.800
Teasing him like this

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.139
should lift his mood a little.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:49.880
My tragic-hero act failed.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.179
I'm trashing the prop.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.820
I feel much better with that splint off.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.220
Why didn't he take his robe in?

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.419
Fan Xiao.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.979
Your robe.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.619
Thanks.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.420
Put your clothes on before you come out.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.480
Put my clothes on?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.700
If I'm dressed, how am I
supposed to show off my goods?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.720
The wine you brought

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.779
is truly good.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.679
Want to join me for a glass?

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:06.399
Is there a condom in the nightstand?

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.880
I'm pretty sure there's
a vending machine in the lobby.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.579
Or is your hand getting in the way?

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.600
Do you need my service?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.720
Then I'll have to trouble you, Director You.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.059
President Fan...

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.420
How do you want your drink?

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.839
Sips from my hand,

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.980
or a full glass at one go?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.149
I'll have it however you prefer.

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.899
The more the better, I guess.

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:01.579
Shu Lang.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:08.119
I'll raise a toast to your acting skills.

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.079
Your right hand's fine,

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.920
and you're still playing the invalid.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.720
Must be tiring wearing that splint every day.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.220
It's only been a couple days.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.040
I healed two or three days ago.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.220
Is fooling me that fun?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.880
Or is my cheap labor that satisfying?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.459
I did trick you.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.660
After my mother died,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.579
no one ever fussed over me like that.

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:35.899
I got greedy.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.760
That's on me.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.519
I'll take it off and toss it.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:43.820
Is it that tough to get it off?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.459
You can't use your left hand well?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.239
Since you're struggling,

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:53.739
let me help you.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.526
Just now, Shi Li Hua couldn't
get through to you

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:58.600
and called me instead.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.760
We chatted and he mentioned

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.200
you won first place in
an e-sports tournament at 16.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.854
You're also left-handed.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:20.019
Shu Lang, it doesn't matter
whether you trust me or not.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.679
I never meant to toy with you
or disrespect you.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.540
I just want your life to revolve around me.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.660
I want to be the only one in your eyes.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.019
Tell me.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.959
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:37.959
I don't care to know either.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.720
What I do know is I'm off duty serving you.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.959
You can sort out your own materials tomorrow.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.040
Pack your own bags.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.500
And right now...

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.540
Go to sleep.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.040
You Shu Lang.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.019
Sooner or later, you'll be mine.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.880
Only mine.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.299
You'll belong to me alone.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.513
[Episode 5]

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:11.200
The second the forum ended,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.959
you dragged me into your car without a word.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.519
But all you wanted was to
bring me to a gay bar?

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:17.359
I pissed you off

00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:19.880
and didn't get a smile out of you
for a whole day.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.200
I racked my brains for what you might like

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.359
and decided to cater to your taste.

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:27.600
So, I've brought you here to pick up a man.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.200
This is Pattaya's most famous
gay bar for Hua people.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.520
How's this arrangement?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.000
I can't wait.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.299
Let's go in then.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.840
Your dancing is so sexy.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.219
Look.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.840
Watch where you touch!

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.320
Let's see who scores first tonight.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.919
I've already picked my target.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.140
Cheers!

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.239
Hey, Luo Luo.

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:18.119
That tall one with chiseled features
seems like your type, right?

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.880
Nah, I like the other one.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.359
The cold, aloof, monkish guy.

00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:24.820
Looks like I'm leaving first.

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:28.140
Go for it!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.640
Didn't you say you'd help me pick up a man?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.039
Where are the men?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.359
Right on cue.

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:34.960
Hi, handsome.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.820
Are you two a couple?

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:38.880
No.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.047
I brought a bottle.

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:43.020
- Mind if we share?
- What do you say, Director You?

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:58.520
Drinking straight is boring.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.539
Let's play dice.

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:24.840
I lost again, but I can't drink anymore.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.979
Maybe you can help me out?

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.072
Sure.

00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:40.919
You're ever so kind.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:44.320
So, will you be drinking all his shots for him?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.719
Why not?

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:46.960
He's young.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.280
Someone should look out for him.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.000
Young indeed.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.479
Even younger than the boy
in your bedside photo.

00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:54.559
Come on, pour.

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.080
I can't wait to help him out.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.640
Mr. You, perhaps we could change venues.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.679
I know a themed hotel.

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:05.179
It has gaming rigs and an IMAX screen.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:09.640
What else can we do there?

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.140
Anything you want.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.520
President Fan, I'll head out first.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.159
I won't be going back to the hotel tonight.

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.599
You should switch venues, too.

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.960
The bar across the street
is full of gorgeous ladies.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.799
You don't have to worry about me.

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:26.460
Have fun.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.640
He's leaving.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.359
Luo Luo's getting taken home!

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.299
Your turn! Go, go!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.419
Bro, buy me a drink?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.554
Sit.

00:11:52.359 --> 00:11:53.520
Hey.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.739
You handled it?

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:57.539
Got it.

00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:03.919
Do you think I'll get what I want tonight?

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.359
Huh?

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:06.890
Yeah, sure.

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:09.859
You definitely will.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.760
Keep the bottle.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.739
It's yours.

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:17.460
You're much more obedient than he is.

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.099
Shame you're not my type.

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:34.039
You've got the wrong guy. It really isn't me.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.359
Please stay calm.

00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:39.119
We're not accusing you,
but the stuff was in your bag.

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:42.599
Come with us to the station
for a routine interrogation.

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:43.940
Mr. You, I...

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Go on. Just explain it clearly to them.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.780
Can we exchange numbers?

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:51.745
There's no need.

00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:53.280
I'm just here on a business trip.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.280
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.559
Okay then.

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:56.820
This way.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.219
President Fan, did you enjoy the show?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.880
I wouldn't dare to do that
when you're involved.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.446
President Fan, stop messing around.

00:13:09.446 --> 00:13:10.479
We're friends.

00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:11.719
I don't want this getting ugly.

00:13:11.719 --> 00:13:13.020
Ugly?

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.000
How would it get ugly?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.280
I spoil you like you're Bodhisattva every day.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.280
Is your heart made of stone?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.580
You really can't feel it?

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:27.219
Or are you upset that I failed to find you
a suitable spring-fling partner?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.000
How about me?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.320
Fuck, say that again?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.679
Director You, do I make the cut?

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:40.020
Can I be your guest for the night?

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:45.960
I told you to repeat yourself
so you could take it back.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.840
But you really doubled down, huh.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.760
I meant it.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.520
No take-backs needed.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.840
Fine.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.960
Here's my answer.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.340
No, you won't do. I'm not interested.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.559
Why not?

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:01.640
What am I lacking?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.140
Lacking?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.599
Your skin's not fair enough.

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:07.000
Your lashes aren't long enough.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.640
Your face isn't tender enough.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.900
And...

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.119
that waist is a huge turn off.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.500
Not flexible enough.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.140
Stiff as a board. Feels horrible to touch.

00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:30.080
Fair, pretty, soft and supple.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.679
Which box do you check?

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:34.780
Sounds like your taste needs correcting.

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:38.119
Should I tutor you?

00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:40.039
Or are you just saying that

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:41.979
to scare me off?

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.960
Just like that boy you took away.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.219
You weren't really going
to a hotel with him, were you?

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:50.119
You're overthinking it.

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:53.080
Maybe I really am.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.280
But when your hands were all over me,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.559
you looked pretty into it.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.640
Men know men best.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.000
You can't deny that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.239
Fan Xiao, for the sake of our friendship,

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:06.039
I've been holding back.

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:08.320
But if you aren't afraid of burning bridges,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.359
answer me.

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:12.640
What do you want?

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.340
Do you want to sleep with me?

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:18.520
Yes.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.859
Very much.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.640
Then tell me this.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.316
Are you gay?

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:28.919
Answer to the point.

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:30.299
Are you?

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.679
I can be.

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:34.239
Fan Xiao.

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:36.400
You just want a fling.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.479
I don't know when you started dabbling in men,

00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:41.039
but if it's because of me,

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.419
I'm sorry.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:47.039
I can promise I never tried to lure you,

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:50.359
and I never did anything to seduce you.

00:15:50.359 --> 00:15:54.760
So, you've never had
the slightest interest in me.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.640
If I'm not mistaken,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.559
the day I kissed you during my episode,

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.599
you reciprocated.

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:02.919
And when you grabbed my waist,

00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:03.960
you were pretty excited.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.159
That's just a normal male reflex!

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:08.700
It has nothing to do with liking you.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.159
Fan Xiao.

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.675
This is just a phase for you.

00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:15.359
You just want something new and exciting.

00:16:15.359 --> 00:16:16.640
Curb your curiosity.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.900
Find yourself a girlfriend, and call it done.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.640
I'm not going back to the hotel tonight.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.080
See you at the airport in the morning.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.340
And after that...

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.859
Let's keep our distance.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.880
Wait, You Shu Lang.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.679
Do you ever quit?

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:42.679
If you want to have fun, go back to that bar.

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.960
With your status,
you'll have plenty of company.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.200
Do me a favor! Don't bother me again!

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.500
I love you.

00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:51.543
I love you.

00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:06.319
I'm not fooling around.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.619
I mean it.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.699
I love you.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.400
That's nonsense.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.920
You say it's nonsense.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.680
Fine, then let me keep up with this nonsense.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.000
I want to see you every day.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.280
When I do, I don't want to part.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.839
When I don't, I feel uneasy.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.079
I've cooked up all kinds
of dumb excuses to see you.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.520
Bohai never had that much work

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.680
that required me to be present.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.000
I don't even like wetland parks.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.040
My sense of direction is bad,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.959
but not so bad I can't use navigation.

00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:32.959
Every time I got lost,

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:34.959
it was just to make you come get me.

00:17:34.959 --> 00:17:36.239
My right hand healed long ago.

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:37.959
Hell, my left is even better.

00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:41.079
Every lousy excuse was just
to stay by your side.

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:42.699
It was all to be with you.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:52.359
I don't know if that's love.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:54.300
You've seen much more of this world.

00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:58.540
Why don't you tell me?

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.339
Fan Xiao.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.199
You say you want to be with me.

00:18:06.199 --> 00:18:07.699
You say it isn't a fling.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.459
It isn't just a whim.

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.420
You Shu Lang.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:19.040
I'm serious.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.439
When I picture the future,

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:22.140
it's you I see.

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:29.699
Being gay is tough in this world.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:32.699
I don't want to drag you into it.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.500
I gave you a chance.

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:40.280
You didn't take it.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.900
Don't blame me

00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:45.579
for not holding back.

00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:52.819
Then kiss me.

00:19:05.199 --> 00:19:08.024
I can't wait, my Bodhisattva.

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:35.060
You like them fair, pretty, and supple?

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:38.359
And what advantages do you have?

00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:40.180
Let me test the goods.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.500
You like men.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.040
You don't like sissies.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.500
Go on.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:57.739
Keep going.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.219
Director You.

00:20:12.959 --> 00:20:14.619
Did I pass the inspection?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.599
President Fan.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:20.560
With a body this good,
you should've stripped earlier.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.900
I'd take you if you were straight!

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:49.819
Shu Lang!

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:55.660
What?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.260
I want a smoke.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.459
Chickening out?

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.859
No.

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:22.199
I'm just used to being on top.

00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:23.500
Now...

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:26.199
It's fine.

00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:28.140
Give me a minute to reset.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.420
I need a little mental prep.

00:21:45.199 --> 00:21:46.500
You do it.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.180
Are you sure?

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.300
You want me to do it?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.459
I don't want our first time
to come with regrets.

00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:12.099
Still, there were some regrets.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.199
It's fine, it wasn't exactly short.

00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:20.420
You hit the average mark for a guy-

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.520
I was too excited.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.917
And a little nervous.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.479
Damn. It's my first time.

00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:30.772
So...

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:34.560
I've never done it with anyone.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.479
Not even women.

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:37.900
You're the first.

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:41.260
Really?

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:51.280
Hey, I'm not laughing at you.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.359
I'm just...

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:55.428
surprised.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.800
Don't rush.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.180
I'll teach you.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.338
Fan Xiao, why are you...

00:24:10.338 --> 00:24:12.540
Okay, that's enough.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.060
Even though I blabbered tons of bullshit,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.300
let me say this again.

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:24.739
You Shu Lang.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.739
I love you.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.012
I love you so much.

00:24:35.079 --> 00:24:36.959
My hair's sticking up.

00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:38.680
I fell asleep on it.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.520
But you didn't even wake me.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.119
It's cute that way.

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:45.199
Besides, why would I wake you?

00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:47.640
You barely slept these past few days.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.339
Zip it.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400
Hand me the suitcase.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.920
Answer your phone.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.773
It's fine. Answer it for me.

00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:56.793
Check who it is.

00:24:56.793 --> 00:24:58.300
It's in my front pocket.

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:04.000
That tickles.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.660
Keep it in your pants.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.719
Should I answer it?

00:25:08.719 --> 00:25:10.880
Yeah. Tell me who it is.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.119
Then put it to my ear.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.479
It's too noisy here, so hold it close.

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:16.739
Okay.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.119
Hello. Yeah.

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.479
I just finished a meeting and got off a flight.

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:25.199
You're picking me up?

00:25:25.199 --> 00:25:27.760
Don't bother. It's a hassle for you.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.300
Tomorrow? I'm busy.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.239
I have meetings to attend.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:34.040
The day after works.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.959
Text me the address.

00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:38.621
Okay, see you then.

00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:45.199
Not gonna ask who that was?

00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:47.959
You're pretty lenient with your partner.

00:25:47.959 --> 00:25:49.640
Who was it?

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.040
A pharma R&D team that keeps
pestering me for funding.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.920
So, they're very enthusiastic.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.979
Are you planning to invest?

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.199
I'm not interested.

00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:01.839
But they're so enthusiastic

00:26:01.839 --> 00:26:03.760
I can't exactly refuse a meal.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.099
Makes sense.

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:09.239
Did your ex ever pick you up at the airport?

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:11.119
Why ask that?

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:12.920
Because I realized...

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.560
your ex probably did everything I'm doing now.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.099
It doesn't sit right with me.

00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:22.739
What a child.

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:29.839
Enough, Fan Xiao!

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:31.500
Stop.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.680
Director You, did I do it right?

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.339
You taught me all of this.

00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:41.260
Cigarette... Hand me the Rouge.

00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:01.859
You Shu Lang.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.640
You know, you were born to be under a man.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640
No one's sluttier than you.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.900
What?

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.560
You Shu Lang, change the curtains.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.819
Huh?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.280
These let in too much light.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.380
I remember your place
has thick blackout drapes.

00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:40.819
You don't like the sun?

00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:44.459
I don't.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.300
During the tsunami,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.300
I watched my mother drown.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.420
I ran out of matches.

00:27:56.079 --> 00:27:57.800
It was pitch black.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.739
There was no light anywhere.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.000
In the dark...

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.979
I couldn't see anything.

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:12.560
I could only pretend

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.459
she was still with me.

00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:17.819
She was just holding her breath longer.

00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:20.699
She hadn't died.

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:24.459
But when the rescue team came

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.819
and pushed the wooden door open,

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:31.660
blinding sunlight flooded in.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.540
I saw my mom's pale face in the water.

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:40.540
I fear the cold.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:47.140
It's the shadow left behind
from being in the water for so long.

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:54.979
It's in the past now.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.640
Actually, darkness isn't all bad.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.180
It hides a lot of cruelty.

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:08.380
It also protects the weak me.

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:14.839
We'll change them.

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:17.420
We can add ten layers if you want.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.780
Be it the sun or darkness...

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:35.599
Wherever you are,

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.380
I'll be there.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.140
I'm showering first.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.579
I'm coming, too.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.079
Don't cling to me.

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:53.380
Shu Lang.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.859
Shu Lang.

00:29:56.479 --> 00:29:59.219
Your ex still has a key?

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:02.839
He forgot to return it.

00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:05.020
And I forgot to ask.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.719
I didn't expect him to visit today.

00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:10.520
Let's head out together.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.979
I'm not going.

00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:19.680
Do you know what's the best way
to make an ex miserable?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.359
Beat him to it

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:23.900
and hide a new lover in your room.

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:26.319
Fan Xiao.

00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:28.640
We parted ways peacefully.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.040
There's no need to hurt him.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.400
And I'm proud to have you as my boyfriend.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.760
You're not some hidden fling.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.060
Got it.

00:30:43.959 --> 00:30:45.040
Fan Xiao.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.380
Fan Xiao.

00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:49.780
Fan Xiao, cut it out.

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:54.111
Since you can't bear to upset him,

00:30:54.111 --> 00:30:58.359
then I'll spare him the shame of seeing me.

00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:00.300
Are you home, Shu Lang?

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:06.859
Lu Zhen.

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.040
Shu Lang.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.699
What brings you here?

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:17.500
The person inside is your...

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.859
Yes, it's my boyfriend.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.099
Oh, I see.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.579
I thought...

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:31.560
you wouldn't get a new boyfriend so soon.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.839
I didn't expect it either.

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:37.400
But fate's weird like that.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.479
By the way, Lu Zhen...

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:41.199
I had your stuff sent to your place.

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:43.020
Is anything missing?

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.339
Y-Yeah.

00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:49.479
I left a painting here.

00:31:49.479 --> 00:31:51.839
Where is it? I'll get it.

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:55.339
It's fine, I'll grab it.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.660
How have you been?

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.859
I'm doing pretty good.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.140
Makes sense.

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:18.699
You've got a new boyfriend.

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:23.640
Who is he?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.140
Would I know him?

00:32:27.199 --> 00:32:31.219
I mean, you social circle's small and...

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.997
Hang on.

00:32:33.997 --> 00:32:35.725
[Fan Xiao]

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.560
I need to get going.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.819
Lu Zhen.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.579
The key to my place.

00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:52.020
Oh.

00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:54.859
I'll leave it here.

00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:57.420
Bye.

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:01.599
Hello, Mr. Fan?

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:04.319
Hello? Mr. Fan?

00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:06.400
Can you hear me? Hello?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.641
[Slide to turn off]

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.760
You've been out there forever.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.560
Did your ex steal your soul?

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.119
Don't be jealous.

00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:25.500
And I haven't settled the score for this.

00:33:26.239 --> 00:33:30.280
Did your ex cheat on you?

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.560
I mean, I can't imagine anyone better than you.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.400
Is he blind?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.920
Don't speculate.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.000
Don't gossip.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.500
Don't stir trouble.

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:44.699
Still defending him, huh?

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.979
Hey, shower with me.

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:52.239
Seared foie gras.

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:54.219
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.339
Mr. Fan.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.280
Mr. Fan, the gifts you've sent lately
are too expensive.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.080
I can't accept them for nothing.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.659
They're nothing.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.899
Just little trinkets.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.919
My friends keep asking what we are,

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:28.639
and why you keep giving me things.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.540
Honestly, I...

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.391
I don't even know how to answer.

00:34:34.391 --> 00:34:35.717
Friends?

00:34:35.717 --> 00:34:37.280
Is it your boyfriend?

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.239
Did I cause trouble for you two?

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.520
No, no.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.080
Just ordinary friends.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.520
I've broken up.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.840
I'm single now.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.139
Why?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.459
Your boyfriend seemed to treat you well.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:56.979
It's just...

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.100
Our personalities didn't match.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.466
Mr. Fan, you're single too, right?

00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:11.139
Zhen Zhen, take a guess.

00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:14.560
I think you're single.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.600
If you had a partner,

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.820
you wouldn't be casually
showering gifts on someone else.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.379
In that case...

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.800
Mr. Fan, why do you keep sending me gifts?

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.459
Why?

00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:34.020
It's because I love you, of course.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.760
Mr. Fan.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.239
That's very sudden. I...

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.360
When I asked you to model,

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.100
I already told you.

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:48.840
I fall in love with every living being I paint.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.320
Every living being?

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.679
Yes.

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:54.300
Every living being.

00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:58.239
Aquatic flowers, a caged bird,

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.199
a dying cicada.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:03.179
And you too, Zhen Zhen.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.919
To you, I'm the same as a flower,

00:36:07.919 --> 00:36:13.600
a bird, and a dying cicada?

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.520
That's right. I love them.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.959
- And I love you.
- Since you love me,

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:21.679
would you be willing to date me?

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.300
- Pardon?
- Will you be my boyfriend?

00:36:25.719 --> 00:36:27.360
When I invited you to model,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.800
I thought I was clear.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.120
I'm just seeking artistic inspiration

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.379
and building a bond with my subject

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.879
to ignite creativity.

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:39.120
It is love,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.780
but not romance.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.959
Is that clear enough?

00:36:44.959 --> 00:36:46.379
Not romance.

00:36:48.919 --> 00:36:51.399
Then what are all these things you've done?

00:36:51.399 --> 00:36:53.899
Don't tell me you don't realize
you've been courting me.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.719
I guess you still misunderstood.

00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:01.159
To me, giving gifts is no different
from watering a flower,

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:05.560
and finding a quiet patch of earth
for a dying summer cicada.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.260
There is no distinction.

00:37:08.399 --> 00:37:09.560
No distinction?

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.320
And I'm switching models.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.600
You're no longer fit for the job.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.479
We probably won't see
each other much in the future.

00:37:19.479 --> 00:37:21.120
Fan Xiao.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.979
Are you screwing with me?

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.399
Do you think I'm an idiot?

00:37:25.399 --> 00:37:27.360
Do you believe your own crap?

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.600
I don't need to waste money

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.600
messing with someone without value.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.959
Lu Zhen.

00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:37.120
Since we met, I've never
crossed a line with you.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.000
I've never said anything frivolous.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.040
I didn't try to pick you up or sleep with you.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.320
Everything you read into my actions

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.419
is your own fantasy.

00:37:45.919 --> 00:37:47.419
Do I...

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:51.100
have to pay for your fantasies?

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.719
I just like to build trust...

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:00.840
Intimacy, even.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.860
Like...

00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:04.959
lovers.

00:38:04.959 --> 00:38:08.280
I'll probably fall for you a little...

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.260
I hope you don't mind my love, a man's love.

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:39.760
Fan Xiao.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.379
To you, I may not be worth much.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.419
But you can't even spare someone worthless.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.840
That makes you a sicko.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.540
Go to hell, you pervert!

00:39:22.479 --> 00:39:24.000
Mr. Sha.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.479
It's about the model you manage.

00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:27.760
Yeah, Lu Zhen.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.600
He's been down lately.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.399
Book him some out-of-town gigs.

00:39:31.399 --> 00:39:33.139
Help him clear his head.

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:36.300
I don't need any models for now.

00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.199
Thanks.

00:39:39.199 --> 00:39:40.232
Bye.

00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:43.899
Oh, don't tell him that I spoke to you.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.840
Director You.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.479
My hands are itching.

00:39:53.479 --> 00:39:54.899
I want to paint you.
