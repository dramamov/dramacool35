Are you sure about this?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
It started because of me.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.360
Of course it should be ended by me.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.130

Auntie Khwan died at 1 a.m.

The cause of death is acute hypoglycemia.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.860
Because someone secretly mixed insulin
into the saline bag.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.659
It was you.

That means the person who did it
[Autopsy Report
Name: Khwan Wanruethai Yotsinphaisan]

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.960
needed at least 30 to 60 minutes to act.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.560
Simply put,
that person had to act before midnight.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.490
I was always in the office
before midnight, Brother.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.800
I have complete documentation to prove it.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.390
You could have ordered someone else
to do it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.230
You're right, Brother.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.660
I certainly
could have ordered someone else to do it.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.960
But why would I do that?

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.530
So you could see me lose everything,
and then you could take it all!

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.790
Let me guess, Brother.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.360
After your mother died,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.430
someone must have delivered documents
to your desk, right?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.930
How did you know?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.530
I asked how you knew!

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.000
Because regarding your Fentanyl case,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.860
someone also delivered documents
to my desk.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.730
Are you saying Risa did it?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.730
Don't talk nonsense, Pheem!

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
You might think
Risa is just a two-faced opportunist,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
siding with whoever has more power.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.260
But that's not it at all, Brother.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.060
She wants the two of us
to kill each other.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.990
Then she can just wait to take everything
from both of us, Brother.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.090
I think
we shouldn't listen to him anymore.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.160
Just kill him quickly,
and it will all be over.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.090
You want to say I killed Dad, right?

Chet.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.290
Do you think getting rid of me
will get you out of this?

Risa will definitely betray you!

When that time comes,

Brother, whose hands do you think
Thanavej will fall into?

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.730

been stained with blood, Brother?

Why are you here?

I was worried about you, Chet,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.890
so I sent someone to follow you.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.160
I knew long ago

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.190

I've been framed!

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.400
Don't forget who your real enemy is!

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.590
Chet, kill him now.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Then everything will go as planned.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.360
We'll say Pheem is the one who killed Dad.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.960
And he killed Auntie Khwan too.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.690
All the charges will fall on me.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.130
Then who will be accused
of killing me, Chet?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.800
Once you kill me,

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.659
Risa will betray you.

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.700
She'll call the police
and have you arrested.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.630
Then she'll neatly take Thanavej.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.420
Chet, don't listen to him!

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.860
Kill him!

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.420
The documents about my mother's death—
you brought them to me, right?

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.960
Chet, do you believe him?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.290
I asked
if it was you who brought them to me!

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.660
Yes.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.480
It was me.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.460
But I just wanted you
to get rid of the bad guy.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.600
Chet,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.690
Pheem killed your mother.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.730
Chet,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.560
I admit...

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.760
I hate you.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.330
I hate Auntie Khwan.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.190
If I want to see you suffer,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.330
I have to make you firmly believe

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.860
that your mother's death was my doing.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.419
Wouldn't that be more satisfying, Brother?

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.570
In my situation at the time,
even if I killed 10 more people,

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.740
Dad would have protected me.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.950
If I really did it,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.000
there would've been no need
to hide it from you, Chet.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.420
Don't listen to him, Chet!

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.360
Chet.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.900
Geez!

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.000

You've been stupid for so long.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.160
And now you're trying to be smart.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.800
This is how it will be, Chet.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.800
Chet, you hated Pheem
for killing your mother,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.460
so you asked Pheem out to talk.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.380
But there was a gunfight,
so both of you died.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.750
I came to mediate,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.010
but I couldn't help either of you.

Where's Pheem?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.600
Than, you should go back.

Mrs. Nit, I'm begging you.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.200
Please tell me, Mrs. Nit,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.490
so that I can help Pheem.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.470
Split up!

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.350
Let's go that way!

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.390
You go that way.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.720
Keep your voice down.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.860
Why are you here?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.760
Mrs. Nit told me.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.220
Than.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.000
I said I would handle it myself.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.000
I don't want you to get into trouble
because of me anymore.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.120
Do you think I would just stand by
and watch you take the risk alone?

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.060
We're married, Pheem.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.990
We're together, Pheem.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.120
Why run away like this
instead of finding a solution together?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.130
I'm sorry.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.930
I promised I would protect you.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.260
I'll keep that promise.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.600
Let's go.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.160
Mr. Chet, you go first!

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.600
You hurry and catch up.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.280
Okay.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.730
Mr. Chet!

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.930
Mr. Chet, are you okay?

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.990
Where were you hit?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.700

You go first!

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.060
Than!

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:53.580
Than!

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.600
I'm okay, Pheem.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.290
You go first.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.500
I'll cover you with gunfire.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.300
-How can I leave you behind?
-Go!

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.970
Go!

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.060
Hello, Mrs. Nit!

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.400
Come and help! Than was shot!

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.100
Okay!

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.700
Than!

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.460
Go!

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.520
Give me the gun.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.650
Stop.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.800
I said stop!

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.330
Put the gun down.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.600
Hurry up!

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.760
Step back.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.520
Than.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.370
Let me do it.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.820
Pheem, hurry up!

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.069
Get in!

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.650
Pheem!

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.400
Pheem, no.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.300
Pheem!

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.360
No!

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.540
Pheem!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.450
Pheem!

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:07.770
Pheem!

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.150
Pheem!

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.880
Currently, the police have discovered
the body of Chet Yotsinphaisan,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.640
the newest CEO of Thanavej Hospital.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.220
He died from a gunshot wound.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.720
According to witnesses,
the perpetrator was Pheem Yotsinphaisan,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.220
the younger brother of the deceased.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.460
Chet and Pheem had a conflict.
They argued very intensely

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.990
about Pheem shooting and killing Dad.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.690
And Pheem was the mastermind
behind the death of Chet's mother.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.890
I tried to stop them, but no one listened.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.990
So I went to find help.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.860
Then suddenly, Pheem shot Chet.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.190
Chet's bodyguard then shot Pheem,
making him fall into the water.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.730
I wonder how Pheem is now.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.090
So, what time did the incident occur?

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.060
Please tell us.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.560
Let Ms. Risa rest first.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.260
-Please tell us, Ms. Risa.
-What was it like?

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.460
-Ms. Risa!
-Ms. Risa!

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.760
Please provide a few more details!

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.700
-Ms. Risa!
-Ms. Risa!

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.060
What time did the incident occur?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.860
Ms. Risa!

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.700
Mr. Chet.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200
-Park.
-Mr. Chet.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.500
Park.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.760
Mr. Chet, please hold on a little longer.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.950
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.400
Park.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.070
Come on.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.670
Park.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.900
-Park!
-Mr. Chet.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.230
It's no use anymore.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.330
Run

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.900
before they find us.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.960
No.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.060
I'll never leave you behind.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.090
Let's go, Mr. Chet.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.450
-Park.
-Let's go.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.250
Park!

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.730
I said it's no use anymore.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.860
You stupid dog,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.090
you've been following me everywhere.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.760
But the place I'm going to—

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.590
you absolutely must not follow me there.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.360
Don't say that, Mr. Chet.
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.230
Mr. Chet, let's go.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.220
Park.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.500
Park.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.150
Thank you for always staying by my side.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.190
I know I'm not a good person,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.580
but you've never abandoned me.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.760
Sorry for causing you trouble.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.410
During this time with you,

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.670
I've never felt it was trouble.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.960
Before I die...

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.560
can you do one last favor for me?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.600
Go live your own life.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.360
Forget everything about me.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.400
Don't avenge me.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.790
Can you do that?

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.090
Okay. Okay, Mr. Chet.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.400
I can finally rest.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.390
Live happily.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.570
Mr. Chet.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.130
You're awake?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.960
Mm.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.570
When I'm with you,
I don't even want to wake up.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.360
Stop putting on this tragic act here.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.930
So our honeymoon trip—

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.160
where should we go? Mm?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.360
Anywhere is fine,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.400
as long as you're with me.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.930
Let's go to Venice, okay?

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.330
Mm...

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.760
We'll start from St. Mark's Square.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.070
You know what?
The way the morning sun hits the dome

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.800
of St. Mark's Basilica
is incredibly beautiful.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.930
Mm.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.610
In the morning
when there are fewer tourists,

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.290
you can see lots of pigeons
circling the square.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.090
Later we can go to Caffè Florian
for a strong espresso.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.700
You know what? Caffè Florian
is the oldest café in Europe.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.360
Wow.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.360
Sounds very romantic.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.490
Hey, I'm not finished.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.950
-Mm?
-Because by evening,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.260
I'll take you on a gondola ride

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.860
to tour the city together.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.690
Hey.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.300
You described it so vividly.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.360
Who did you go with before?

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.960
I went there alone.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.860
Who could I have gone with?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.860
You know what? At that time,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.860
I was so lonely.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.700
Mm.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.360
But if you go with me this time,

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.330
it will definitely be amazing.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.710
Actually, any place where you are

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.200
is a good place.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.160
Any place where you are
is also a good place.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.870
I want to be with you forever.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.200
Can I hug you?

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.730
You know this, right?

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.560
We can't be like this forever.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.660
No.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.190
Just wait a little longer.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.060
Let me miss you a little while longer,
okay?

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.720
Mm?

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.860
I want to be with you.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.490
Pheem, don't go. Stay with me.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.790
Mom.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.570
Dad.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.900
Pheem is gone, Mom.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.600
Dad.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.760
Mom, Pheem is gone.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.430
Than.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.100
I know it's hard, my child.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.060
But you must be strong, child.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:00.990
Be strong.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.370
Mom and Dad are with you.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.200
Be strong, child. I'm here.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.800
My good child.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.890
The rescue team found Mr. Pheem's clothing
near the incident site.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.750
I must take my leave now.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.250
Okay.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:26.920
Okay.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.560
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.380
Ms. Risa, the police haven't found
Mr. Pheem's body yet.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.120
But they found the clothes he was wearing
when he fell into the water.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.920
It's been a long time.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.100
I think he's dead.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.330
As for Than,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.090
I don't know where he's hiding now.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.290
He might have already escaped
across the border.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.550
It has been over 2 weeks
since the tragedy occurred.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.420
There are now reports

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.450
that the board of Thanavej Hospital
and its affiliated hospitals has decided
[One News]

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.600
to formally appoint
Ms. Arisa Yotsinphaisan

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.800
as the chairwoman of the board,

That you married me?

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.730

Chet, you hated Pheem
for killing your mother,

so you asked Pheem out to talk.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.460
But there was a gunfight,

A shocking incident occurred
at a renowned private hospital.

The new Board Chairwoman,
Ms. Arisa Yotsinphaisan,

in the parking lot.

The perpetrator

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.150
was the former trusted aide

Parkphum Mahathai Khiri,
who also died at the scene.

Who would have thought he just broke in
and shot them in broad daylight?

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.300

Their whole family is dead.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.460
Why do you care so much about them?

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.020
They can just find someone else
to manage it.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.360
They fought to death.

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.860

Everyone has paid the price
for what they did.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.730
It's a shame you didn't get to see it.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.140
But I've already told the police

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.490
that I got the evidence from you.

You don't need to worry anymore.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.640
I'll stay strong and live on.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.450
But it will probably be very hard
because I no longer have you by my side.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.140
I will try my best to live well.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.310
I never thought...

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.510
I would love someone so deeply.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.120
I miss you so much.

I miss you too.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.790
Is it really you, Pheem?

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.080
Pheem.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.800
I clearly saw you get shot
and fall into the water.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.050
Why are you here, Pheem?

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:15.150
Mm?

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.950
All of this was planned in advance
by me and Mrs. Nit.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.720
I knew early on

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.570
Risa would never let Chet come alone.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.760
So I wore a bulletproof vest in advance.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.480
And it actually came in handy.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.050
After I fell into the water,

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.750
I swam to the other shore.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.000
Then I threw all my personal belongings
into the water

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.900
to make Risa and the others think

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:48.740
I really died.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:53.280
That way, I would have time
to find a way to expose them again.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.600
I left you the video from that night,

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.010
in case the plan failed
and I couldn't survive.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.090
Then at least you'd have something
to negotiate with them.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.540
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.030
Do you know how heartbroken I was, Pheem?

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.460
I know, Than.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.060
Didn't I hurry to get treatment?

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.930
After recovering,
I still had a lot of documents to handle.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.470
What documents, Pheem?

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.920
The only way to end all of this

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.400
is for Pheem Yotsinphaisan to die.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.720
What about the hospital matters, Pheem?

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:40.830
I've had enough.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.240
I don't want anything more
to do with Thanavej.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.530
I don't want to be involved
in this power struggle anymore.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.430
I just want to live with you every day,

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.330
being with the person I love.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.570
I am no longer called Pheem Yotsinphaisan.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.200
This.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:14.210
Now my name is...

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.540
[ID Card
Name: Damgoeng Phonok]

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.540
Damgoeng.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.420
-Damgoeng.
-If you don't like this name...

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:24.520
you don't have to be with me. It's fine.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.110
I'll just find a new husband.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.610
Pheem, Pheem, Pheem.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.420
I like any name.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:32.190
Mm.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.130
No matter which path you choose,

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:47.290
I will support you.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.180
Really?

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.320
Mm.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.830
But I have nothing now,

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:00.730
including all the assets and money I had.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.260
Do you still want to be with me?

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:07.230
Yes.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.360
Don't worry about that.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.300
It just so happens
that my ex recently passed away.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.900
And he left me a lot of money.

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:20.670
I'm quite a catch as a widower now.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.040
Come and be with me. I'll support you.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:27.630
Okay?

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:30.860
You said it.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:31.940
Mm.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.300
Thank you, Than.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.500
Thank you for giving me the chance
to love you.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.420
And thank you for letting me know

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.530
what true happiness is like.

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.090
I want to thank you too, Pheem.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.390
Thank you for coming back to me.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.890
I love you, Pheem.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:12.340
No.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.490
I love you, Damgoeng.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.310
Perfect.
