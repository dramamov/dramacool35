00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.040
You really love music.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.040
You play and sing quite well, too.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.080
You shouldn't be thinking about
inheriting the family business.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.120
I remember you once said

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.840
you don't like inheriting the company.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.120
Did I ever tell you that?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.040
With your vibe,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.320
isn't it obvious?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
I passed the art exam ages ago.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.200
My major score was really high.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.880
But my dad found out.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.800
My dad...

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.400
He insists I learn business.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.720
Xiao Zhao.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.040
Ren Nan is downstairs at the company.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.200
If he asks about me,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.520
just say I'm not here.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.120
Okay.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.840
He's definitely here to nag me
about art school.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Hello, Young Master Ren.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.480
Hello, Young Master Ren.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.520
My dad loves being so flashy.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.080
I'm just afraid you'll be even flashier
in the future.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.520
You're clearly in the office,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.200
but you have the secretary say
you're not here.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.960
No way.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.040
I'm not that kind of person.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.480
By the way,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.360
where's my dad?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.120
I think Mr. Ren isn't here.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.640
That's perfect.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.360
Let's go.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.680
Young Master Ren.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.440
Young Master Ren.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.000
Your dad—

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.480
Why won't he let you study music?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720
He says the record industry
is struggling.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.800
This thing—

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.040
he bought it for me in middle school.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.120
And now?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.120
Now he tells me to give it up.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.600
Old men—

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.720
they're just fickle.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.160
How is it?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.280
It's great.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.600
Back in middle school,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.560
his business wasn't so busy.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.720
He even played drums with me.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.440
Later, his business grew bigger.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.240
He didn't have time for me anymore.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.800
Isn't this Brother Liu, the Stock God?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.560
Hello, Stock God.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.440
Stock God? Please.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.240
I just know a bit about stock investing.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.920
Stock God, we all heard from Mr. Ren—

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.760
he said every stock you recommend rises.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680
Stock God, could you mentor me someday?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.120
You're too kind.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.360
Is Mr. Ren here?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.240
Mr. Ren isn't here.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.240
Young Master Ren is here.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.240
Aren't you leaving yet?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.640
It's fine.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.080
My dad won't be back for a while.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.880
I'll play some video games.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.640
You take a break, too.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.160
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.040
I've never sat in a CEO chair before.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.240
I might as well try it out.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.520
See what it's like to be Young Master Ren.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.760
I hate it when people call me Young Master Ren.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.680
It's like I'm only my dad's son,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.080
and don't even have my own name.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.480
But your name—

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.960
wasn't it given by your dad, too?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.520
Is Young Master Ren here?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.360
Nice to meet you, Young Master Ren.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.520
My surname is Liu.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680
I've met Mr. Ren a few times.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.800
You've got it wrong.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.560
I'm not Young Master Ren.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.240
Young Master Ren, you're being dramatic again.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.560
Even though

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360
he never respects your choices,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.800
never cares what you really think,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120
he's still your real dad, no matter what.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.600
This young man makes sense.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh, right—

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720
Liu Haishi.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.280
If you don't mind,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.000
you can call me Uncle Liu.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.160
Uncle Liu.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.560
Looks like your dad

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.280
has been following my stock picks.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.240
Look at this—

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.640
they've all skyrocketed!

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.040
Three months ago,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.280
I recommended some promising stocks
to your dad.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640
He didn't believe me.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.480
They went up the very next day.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.560
And then?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.000
I recommended a few more.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.360
He still didn't believe me.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.640
He missed out again.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.480
Later on,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.520
I recommended stocks to him several times.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.080
Every time they rose,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.520
they skyrocketed!

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.640
That's amazing!

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.000
You came today

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.720
to talk business with Mr. Ren, right?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.520
Should we let Mr. Ren know?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.440
Have him come over.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.680
No rush.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.520
I'm just here to sit for a bit.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.840
Young Master Ren also likes the drums.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.240
I liked them too when I was young.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.280
In the future,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.840
are you planning to pursue art?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.200
Not planning to inherit the family business?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.400
Young Master Ren can't decide his own life.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.840
Of course he'll inherit the family business.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.360
Isn't that right, Young Master Ren?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.680
Well,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.840
since that's the case,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.640
Young Master Ren can start managing money now.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.720
Uh,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.000
Money,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.400
the more you know it,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.040
the more it knows you.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.560
Look at your outfit.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.040
Oh,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.480
just look at your classmate's shoes.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.560
It shows Young Master Ren's social circle

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.240
is quite valuable too.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.560
Young Master Ren,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.840
you're usually pretty well-off, right?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.480
I...

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.080
When I'm free,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.760
I like to throw parties for the class.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.480
Set off fireworks,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.280
do some flashy, romantic activities.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.320
So, are you interested

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.120
in the stock market?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.040
Just think,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.280
if you make money in stocks,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.720
you can treat the whole class

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.320
to a party,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.240
watch fireworks,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.160
and have another romantic class event.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.360
Most importantly,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.040
you can buy instruments you like.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.320
If you can earn money on your own,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.040
then in the future,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.240
your father won't control you as much.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.760
How much money do I need?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.280
Well,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.760
we can start by buying some loose stocks.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.600
I'll scrape together some more,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800
help you get one hundred thousand.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.200
Try to get you in the market first.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.800
No need to scrape up one hundred thousand.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.680
I already have that much myself.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.680
Look at your handsome classmate,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.200
he's got a business mind.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.960
Want to consider

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.440
starting with one hundred or two hundred thousand?

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.240
Just to practice.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
Sure.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
I'll put up one hundred thousand first.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.120
Alright.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.360
So, um...

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.560
You're not much older than me.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.360
Calling you "uncle" doesn't fit.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.120
How about I call you Brother Liu?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.560
Okay.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.720
Brother Liu,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.320
this trip wasn't easy for you.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.640
It wasn't really hard.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.840
As long as there's profit,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.320
it's all worth it.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.080
Of course, I mean

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.560
from thousands

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.880
or hundreds of stocks,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.440
you picked someone like Young Master Ren.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.640
That's really not easy.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.360
What do you mean by that?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.120
Did Young Master Ren tell you that?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160
Brother Liu,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.800
I have a question for you.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.080
If a stock rises a lot and falls a little,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.040
is that a bull market trend feature?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.800
Uh...

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.880
Young Master Ren,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.160
I'm all about real trading.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.200
I don't study theory much.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.280
As long as it makes money, that's enough.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.800
You...

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.440
Look at the stocks I recommended to your dad.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.880
Every single one

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.840
was accurately predicted to rise or fall.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.280
Open your dad's email,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560
check the dates.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.240
Didn't I recommend them first,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.560
and then they went up?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.520
I think,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.960
no need to bother opening his email.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360
How about you open your own email

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.480
and let me take a look?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.360
Uh...

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.640
That's not a good idea.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.000
Besides Young Master Ren,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120
you probably send

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.400
the same email to hundreds of people daily.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.840
You pick a stock that day,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.560
then send to different groups

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.080
whether it'll rise or fall.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.640
The chance of rising or falling is fifty-fifty.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.560
So,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.640
some people

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.360
will think your prediction is right.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.760
Next,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280
you repeat the trick.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.720
Eventually, you'll filter out a group

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.560
who, in their eyes,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.360
you

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600
are the Stock God.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.320
Because your predictions

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.160
are always correct.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.880
That's why I admired you just now.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
One in a thousand.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.520
If you had this perseverance,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.080
and did a proper job,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.440
you'd have made it long ago.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.120
But I think,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.760
such a complex job

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.360
can't be done by just one person.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.080
Behind you,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.760
there must be a whole

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.520
scam team, right?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.520
Don't panic.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.280
Go turn yourself in.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.080
Try to get leniency.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.000
Yu Xingchen.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.600
Yu Xingchen.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.320
Ruoruo

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.760
Why are you here?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.600
Auntie

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.960
Is Yu Xingchen home?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.360
I need to talk to him.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.600
He'll be back soon.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.200
Don't just stand there.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.120
Come in and have a seat.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.000
Hurry up, come on.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.520
No need, Auntie, really.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.240
Old Yu

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.520
Your daughter is here.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.400
Hurry up.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.640
Cut some fruit, make tea.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.520
Grab a bottle of cola.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.760
Quick, don't dawdle.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.720
I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.720
Yu Xingchen

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.240
How did you figure out

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.360
he was a scammer just now?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.040
This kind of trick is only popular now.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.520
In a few years, most people will spot it.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.640
But your way with words was amazing.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.760
Just a few sentences,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.040
and that guy was speechless.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.360
If I had your eloquence,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.840
could I convince my dad

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.880
to let me study music?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160
That's how it is.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.840
Your dad's point

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.720
is actually right.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.880
In a few years,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.320
the record industry will decline.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.960
But what he doesn't know

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.120
is this field will have new ecological development.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.360
The future is the internet era.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.360
We won't need CDs to listen to music.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.280
So you mean

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.120
using a portable media player

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.840
or listening on a phone?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.600
Just think about it.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.040
If one day

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.840
we can shop and order food by phone,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.440
listen to music on our phones,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.280
watch movies, live streams, play games—

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800
what does that mean?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.880
What does it mean?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.240
That's a huge change.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.400
Let me just tell you one thing.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.000
Right now,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.040
we line up at CD stores for albums.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.160
But in the future,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.680
just a tap on our phones,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.480
and the album is on our phone.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.280
And your songs will instantly go online,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.160
so people can hear them anytime, anywhere.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.720
So tell me,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.760
the decline of the record industry

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.120
and you being a singer—

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.520
are they really connected?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.880
But the key is,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.680
your songs have to be good.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.240
That's too far-fetched.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.520
Is that even possible?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.000
-But what you said seems -Yeah,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.600
to make some sense.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
These things

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.120
are hard for you to grasp.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.320
But your dad's been in business for years.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.400
As a successful entrepreneur,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.760
he surely knows.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.360
It's 2010 now.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.600
Change has already begun.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.920
Your dad probably

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.600
senses this trend.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.280
Alright.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.360
I'll do as you said

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.400
and talk to my dad.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.480
Ruoruo, have some more.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.240
Uncle, Auntie,

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.400
I really can't eat anymore.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080
Also,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.280
I need to head back.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.960
Ruoruo

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.000
Stay a bit longer.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.760
Xingchen will be back soon.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.280
It's getting late.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.120
I need to go home and study.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.880
Of course, you can't neglect your studies.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.680
Uncle's only regret is

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.840
he just learned Sea View Buddha Jumps Over the Wall

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.760
and hasn't had a chance to show you.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.920
Then next time, I'll try it.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.920
While you have these days,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.520
learn a few more dishes.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.480
Next time, cook them for Ruoruo together.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.080
I'll walk her home then.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.160
No need.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.080
I can go back myself.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.200
I won't trouble you, Uncle.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.800
It's no trouble at all.
