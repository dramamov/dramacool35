[Episode 12]

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.260
Chen Wenbin, have you lost your mind?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.300
The ledger's with Zhou Nian.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.140
It's a fake.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.140
It's a trap set by Wang Penghui.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.820
It's too dangerous for you
to enter the Wang family now.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.860
I can help you with what you need to do.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.900
Wang Penghui already suspects you.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.900
Suspects what?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.660
Don't you realize how you're acting now

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.220
is causing trouble for others?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.900
You think you're so clever, is that it?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.060
You'd even risk your marriage

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.460
just to get into the Wang family?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.740
Liu Rumeng, are you insane?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.940
Yes.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.940
I'm desperate for revenge,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.420
so desperate I've gone mad.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.020
Wang Penghui suspects you, too.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.660
Do you think putting on a lovesick act

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.460
in front of all those people

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100
actually helps me?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.940
What I want to do,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.220
and who I choose to marry,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.940
is my own business.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.700
I'm asking you...

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.060
never to bother me again.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.940
Dad,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.860
there's something wrong with Liu Rumeng.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.620
We can't let her into the Wang family.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.700
Her relationship with Wenbin
is far from proper.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.460
If she really becomes your concubine,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.860
our family's reputation will be ruined.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.460
If I call off the engagement now,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.460
do you think we can walk away unscathed?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740
Can't you use your head?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.860
There's one thing I don't get.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.340
Just what method

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460
did Liu Rumeng use

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.180
to make Chen Wenbin

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.300
so devoted to her?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.660
Dad,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.700
this woman

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.500
flirts with men everywhere.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.780
- So she...
- Does it matter?

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.900
If you had even half of her cunning,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.700
Chen Wenbin would have...

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.860
Forget it.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.740
I can't even be bothered to scold you.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.540
Sweetheart,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.660
have you ever seriously considered

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.980
why I do these things

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.300
day after day?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.420
If our Wang family

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.220
has the Chen family's support,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.260
let alone returning
to the Chamber of Commerce,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.060
even the position
of Chamber President

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.300
will be within my grasp.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.420
You saw it yourself today.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.500
That scumbag Li

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.740
humiliated me in front of everyone.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.020
It shouldn't be too difficult, actually.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.020
Remember when we were playing cards
that night?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.140
Mr. Li could barely

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.820
take his eyes off Liu Rumeng.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.900
Excuse me.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.260
You're finally showing some cleverness.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.100
Liu Rumeng,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.540
this is the price you pay

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.300
for messing with Wenbin.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.460
You're injured?

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.740
I heard all the guests talking today

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.620
about the Wang family's concubine
and you, Marshal Chen.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.820
The two of you were all over each other.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.420
You had me, a reporter, play the thief.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.860
With the stir you caused today,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.460
all of Song City is buzzing.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.260
You saved her, yes.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.260
But how do you plan
to deal with the aftermath?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.180
You thought you couldn't

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.260
stop Liu Rumeng?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.860
So you caused the scandal

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.460
to make Wang Penghui

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.100
give up on marrying her, right?

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.820
It is the only way to stop her

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.700
from marrying into the Wang family.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.600
[Blycher Hotel]

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.660
What are you doing?

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.140
I have everything arranged.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.900
If you agree,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.140
I'll take you away right now.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.060
I've made myself perfectly clear.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.420
Even if this path leads me to heck,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.500
it's none of your concern.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.740
So you're determined

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.340
to marry into the Wang family?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.660
Yes.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.140
My fiancé will be here soon.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.140
Please leave.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.540
Don't make me hate you.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.780
Sir.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.100
All alone?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.660
Yes.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.460
Changed your clothes?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.300
Yes.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940
I cut my hand

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.340
while changing into the wedding gown.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.780
Come here.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.860
It seems beautiful people

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.660
should wear beautiful clothes.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.980
On our wedding day,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.660
you should wear this.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.900
Okay.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.500
But I have a question

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.540
to ask.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.780
Before you enter the Wang family,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.060
shouldn't you

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.980
show some good faith?

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.500
Look how scared you are.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.460
I'm not that impatient.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.980

what are you doing here?

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.220
This is from Liu Rumeng.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.900
Liu Rumeng is now

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.420
my father's concubine.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.580
And you still have feelings for her?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.540
Aren't you ashamed?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.260
This place is nice.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.180
I must have Chen Wenbin.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.460
I can't let my father down.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.300
Miss Wang, the incense burner
you prepared

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.100
has been placed in room 903.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.940
Go tell Marshal Chen

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.140
that Liu Rumeng has something for him.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.620
It's in room 903.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.260
Yes.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.020
Liu Rumeng, thank you for teaching me

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.180
that if I want something,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.420
I must seize it by any means necessary.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.300
I've already written to my father

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.780
to break off our engagement.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.940
Ours was an arranged engagement
since childhood.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.340
You're calling it off, just like that?

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.060
What am I supposed to do?

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.620
We...

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.460
are the perfect match.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.420
Can you feel my heartbeat?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
