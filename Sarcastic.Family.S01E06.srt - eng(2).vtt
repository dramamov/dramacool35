00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.680
What happened to your foot?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.040
What's going on?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.280
What's this about?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.840
This neighborhood...

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.480
The ground's full of potholes.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.159
I twisted my ankle just now.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.400
That broken road in our complex...

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.240
Feels like everyone’s twisted an ankle there.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.719
The property management is useless.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.919
I've complained several times.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.199
No response at all.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:13.719
I'll get you some medicine.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.879
I can't stand this anymore.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.240
This property management is too much.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.680
The elevator breaks down every day.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.080
The roads are full of holes.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.719
Four guards, seven teeth between them.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.800
Hanghang, let me tell you—

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.960
This incident is a catalyst.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.680
I'm rallying everyone to defend our rights.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.879
Ten people have joined me already.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.400
I'll show this property management

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.159
what rock spirit really means.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.479
These people go too far, Dad.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.039
Dad.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.280
You need to be careful.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.520
I heard

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.719
this shady property management

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.120
are all streetwise types.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.199
So what if they're streetwise?

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.919
Who hasn't been out in the world?

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.360
You don't know me.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.039
In words,

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.400
I can bring peace with my pen.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.919
In action,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.199
I can settle things on horseback.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.919
Right?

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.120
I'll go talk to them.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.080
If they're civil,

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.479
I'll treat them civilly.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.639
If they get rough with me,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
I'll show them

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.560
what real roughness is.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.759
Is this the legendary Lightning Five-Chain Whip?

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.960
Of course—five in a row.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.479
Co-in-law.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.159
How's my kung fu?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.039
With your skills?

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.879
Even a poodle would be a life-or-death fight.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.680
Then you misunderstand me.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.879
Check my WeChat name.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.759
Rock Mastiff.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.800
I'll show them what happens

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.159
when you anger a mastiff.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.960
Homeowners' Rights Defender.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.159
Attention, defenders of rights!

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.039
In ten minutes,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.680
gather at the east public restroom.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.759
Dad.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.159
Be sure to stay safe.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.080
Drink!

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.159
Why are you drinking now?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.800
Liquid courage, you know.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.159
There's meaning behind this.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.639
Red Star lights my way.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.319
Let them see who I am.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.960
Oh my god.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.560
You can speak English too?

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.719
I meant the dog seller.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.919
What's wrong with selling dogs?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.120
Liu Bei sold shoes, didn't he?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.199
Qin Qiong sold horses.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.319
Elon Musk sells cars.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.199
Just wait for my victory news.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.039
Be careful.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.599
It's fine.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.680
Property manager, come out!

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.520
Come out!

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.639
Come out now!

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:06.400
Come out!

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520
Hurry up and come out!

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.479
Come out!

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.000
Manager, come out now!

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.120
Come out now!

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.080
What's all this noise?

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.360
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.680
Brother Long.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.879
Those are the troublemakers.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.360
The ringleaders causing trouble.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.439
So you are—

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.040
the troublemaking homeowners, right?

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.120
I'm the property manager.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.079
Long Yuegang.

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.519
Or you can call me

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.000
Xiao Long.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.600
First,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.000
we are not troublemakers.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.600
Second,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.240
since you know we're homeowners,

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.439
listen to our complaints properly.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.720
Serve us well.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.199
Serve us well.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.079
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.959
Let me be honest with you.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.920
I've managed this property for years.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.439
No one's ever reported problems to us.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.120
Xiao Qiang.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.720
Someone has reported issues.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:55.000
I-I haven't heard of that.

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.519
See?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.000
Not hearing doesn't mean it didn't happen.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.560
Right.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.279
Right, look at these bumpy roads.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.720
The elevator breaks every other day.

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.360
Trash piles up and no one cleans it.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.319
We have only three guards in the complex.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.519
They're two hundred fifty years old combined.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.959
Everyone coming and going

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.959
doesn't dare honk the horn.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.959
Afraid the guards will be startled away.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.439
Right.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.120
They'll be gone.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.680
Yes.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.360
The key is,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.439
we're short on funds.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.920
How about this—

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.519
let's raise the property management fee

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.319
by just one yuan.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:22.639
I'll immediately hire

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.920
guards under sixty.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.279
Trying to make up excuses again?

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.720
No way.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:26.439
I'm telling you,

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.839
we already pay enough in fees.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.279
If you don't fix these problems,

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.279
starting next year,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.680
we won't pay the property fee.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.519
We won't pay.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.000
Not paying, not paying.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.319
Not paying.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.680
I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.319
I'll take the lead.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.680
If you don't fix things,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.680
I won't pay the property fee starting today.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.759
Try not paying and see.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.879
I'll try, just watch me.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.959
I will.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.240
I wrote a song complaining about property management.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.319
You're well-educated.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.319
Help me check it over.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.560
If it's too advanced, I can't understand it.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.920
Let me see.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:15.680
Gotta speak out.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.839
Won't let it go.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.920
Won't stop, won't quit.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.759
Can't accept, can't ignore.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.800
How is it?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.040
This seemingly simple, repetitive rhetoric—

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.879
Isn't it?

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.720
Does it fully express
my rebellious spirit?

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.879
Is it all out there?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040
Property manager,

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.240
you're pig-headed and big-eared.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.000
You're bloated and greedy.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.800
You [sensitive words] [sensitive words] [sensitive words].

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.560
Dad, why are there so many sensitive words in your song?

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.839
It's rock music.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.920
Sometimes you need rough words.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.319
To hype up the mood.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.560
Raise the energy.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.560
Your blood pressure's as high as your height.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.000
Try to control your emotions.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.199
At my age, I can barely control my bladder.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.560
Why bother controlling emotions?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.000
Mom.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.120
Are you planning to

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.000
just howl this song?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.759
Bass.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.519
Accompaniment.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.120
I'll do it myself.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.800
You really know how.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:59.519
Of course I do.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.639
Over thirty years of skill.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.160
They call me

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.120
the Lang Lang of bass.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.680
See?

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.560
That's technique.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.160
If the east isn't bright,

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:12.519
the west will shine.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.600
Let the setting sun dry up all sorrow.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:19.560
Pretty good, pretty good.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.120
Not bad.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.279
Secondhand Rose.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.959
Liang Long.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.879
Very unique.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:24.399
I really like it.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.040
How is it?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.199
Every note

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.199
hits Liang Long's nerves.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.120
I have other ways to accompany.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.560
You, you—

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.839
Are your two dentures fighting in your mouth?

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.720
That's called vocal technique.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.480
Is it good?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.759
Is it good?

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:46.600
Hard to say.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.839
After you finish ranting,

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.839
no one can eat at this table.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.000
I want to rant so much

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.240
that property management can't eat.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.120
Hello.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.519
Let me introduce myself.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.959
I'm the new colleague.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.120
My name is Wang Guizhen.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.399
I'm the boss's assistant.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.680
Hello, hello.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.120
Are you—

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.079
Interviewed by the boss?

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.519
Interviewed by the boss's wife?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.240
So you're also here

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.919
to keep an eye on the boss?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.960
Hello, finally we meet.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:45.919
But next time,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.879
don't mention our secret mission.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.039
Okay.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:54.720
Is this safe?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.120
It's fine.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.759
Come here.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.200
I'm here this time

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.039
to help you with the mission.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.080
I'm more professional in this.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.320
There's a professional for this?

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.159
Do you know what I used to do?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.600
Paparazzi.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.960
No wonder.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.799
Wait, I do a pretty good job.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:31.120
Why add another professional to my team?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080
Right?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.360
Boss's wife.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.919
Is she not satisfied with me?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.200
Didn't the boss just secure funding?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.080
His charm has skyrocketed.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.480
Chances of flings have increased.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.799
Boss's wife needs a deeper nail.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:58.720
Let the neighborhood light up for me.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.639
Go fill in the potholes.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:04.840
Then get property management fired.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.679
See?

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:08.799
The property company does nothing.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.360
But still raises the price.

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:19.360
He's been yelling all day.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:21.039
We need to stop him quickly.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:24.399
Or it'll affect us badly.

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.320
True.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.480
Indeed.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.200
It'll hurt our reputation.

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.840
I mean it'll affect our health.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.519
I'm coming to find you.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.000
Let's be reasonable.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.960
Be reasonable, be reasonable.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.039
The singing is awful.

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:45.159
It's killing me.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.799
It's like Sun Wukong's headband curse.

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:49.600
Exploded.

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:51.840
Be reasonable, be reasonable.

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:55.240
How do you usually work?

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.679
I just watch him.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.799
Then follow him.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.240
You, you, you're underestimating

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.600
a cat's sneaky skills.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.200
It's fine.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.559
I've trained for this.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.480
I never blink when I'm watching someone.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:08.840
Internet celebrity.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.960
So many people watching.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.360
Eight bodyguards in one meter.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.519
Fans still find a way in.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.440
Seems true.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.799
Our industry

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.320
is just like any other.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.360
You need to be professional.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.120
Oh my god.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.200
What is all this?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.919
So many old things.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.759
This—what is this?

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:37.440
A bug.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.799
Isn't this illegal?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.720
Boss's wife personally authorized it.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.919
To use on the boss.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.559
It's fine.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.399
Remember,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.600
in the boss's wife's house,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.159
she makes the rules.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.360
What about this one?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.399
What is this?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.519
High-powered binoculars.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.879
The boss is cheating with Chang'e on the moon.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.759
I could even see it.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.159
No need for that.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:03.960
The boss is afraid of heights.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.759
He can't get up there.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:09.799
And this one?

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.559
Military night vision goggles.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.039
Night vision goggles are a bit much.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.159
We won't need those, right?

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.559
Using night vision goggles for this...

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.320
Here, perfect timing, take a look.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.240
That's not what I meant.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.639
Look at my pants.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:22.480
Do they make my legs look short?

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:23.600
They look fine.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.360
Yeah, they're good.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.279
Very classy and stylish.

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.960
Details decide success or failure.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.720
What if the boss goes out at night?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.039
What if our company...

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.039
has a power outage?

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.360
He goes to the finance lady to check the glowing report.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.000
Boss.

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:36.879
That makes sense too.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:37.759
The graphic design one.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.440
Every person

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.960
has their own

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.919
infrared imaging.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.519
The deeper the color,

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.159
the higher their temperature.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.519
No idea why,

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:50.200
the boss's color

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.279
isn't as deep as the others'.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.840
You need to think more broadly.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.639
Open your mind even wider.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.960
That's normal.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.879
Bosses are usually cold-blooded.

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:03.559
Makes sense.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:04.919
Not good.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.360
I think the boss is going out again.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.759
Then let's hurry and follow him.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:09.399
No way.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:11.159
This mission is too dangerous.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.440
You're still young.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:13.600
Please stay silent.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.879
I'll finish the mission for you.

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.159
That won't work.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:18.000
The boss's wife will say I'm slacking off.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.399
The organization won't doubt your sincerity.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.240
Once I figure out the boss's whereabouts,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.360
I'll send you a secret report.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.720
Keep your communication device on.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.879
I'll just keep an eye on my phone.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.519
Right.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.519
I don't have your number.

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:36.919
We homeowners must be strong.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.559
Be strong.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.879
Let the neighborhood serve me.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:43.879
Serve me.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.039
Stop singing.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.919
Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:49.879
One string costs three thousand, it's limited edition.

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:53.159
Let's talk calmly.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.399
Talk calmly.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:56.440
We're using music

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:57.720
to express our demands.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.879
Come on, keep singing.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.440
Stop singing, stop singing.

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:04.799
Everyone, listen to me.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:05.360
Go ahead.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:07.679
How about this?

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.440
You all

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.759
go back first.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.720
I'll consider solving everyone's problems.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:12.240
How's that?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.080
I'll give you one day.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.960
If I can't solve it,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.879
we'll come back and keep singing.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.679
Stop singing, stop singing.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.399
One day.

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:24.240
One day, one day.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.440
Just one day.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.240
Give them one day.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.320
We'll trust you one more time.

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:30.600
Trust me, trust me.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.879
Finally, they've stopped singing.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.039
Sis.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:44.279
Li Lili, did I hire you for a vacation?

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.279
No, I...

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.120
Wang Guizhen

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.080
just sent me an eight-thousand-word

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.159
tracking analysis report.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:50.639
And a ninety-nine-page presentation.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:51.679
What are you doing?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.039
She told me to wait for her message.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.320
Attitude decides everything.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.399
Understand?

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:57.480
I'm here.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:58.600
Shut up.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.440
Li Lili, slow down when you eat.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.759
Slow down a bit.

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:13.200
I...

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.399
I can't keep up with you.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.919
You guys...

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.720
Didn't you see the property manager's face?

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.080
It was red one moment,

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:26.639
yellow the next,

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:27.360
then green.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.960
He almost kneeled before me.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.639
Now I feel like in our neighborhood,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.600
four words:

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.879
a big shot.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.000
Look at you showing off.

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:39.919
Maybe tear up your family tree

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.720
and start a new page with you.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.960
Not a bad idea.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.960
Li Lili

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:52.840
Weren't you always talking about dieting?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.039
So how come now...

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.320
you just keep eating those wraps?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.879
You guys have no idea.

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.759
We got a new coworker at our company.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.399
She's just ruthless.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:02.759
She almost outcompeted me to death.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.720
How did she do it?

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:05.840
She...

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.039
followed the boss.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.120
She used a drone directly.

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.919
It flew over a thousand meters high.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960
Covered a five-kilometer radius.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.799
Saw everything in sight.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.840
She could even see the boss's nostrils.

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:15.919
They're upside down.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.440
Better be careful on rainy days.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.200
Water might collect.

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.039
That's not what I meant.

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:21.279
She not only...

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.080
competes,

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.639
she does it secretly.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.039
I figured it out.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.440
There's a technical term for it.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:27.519
It's called stealth competition.

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:28.279
Right.

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.679
Watching the boss

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:30.799
was supposed to be my job, right?

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:32.320
She secretly followed the boss.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.159
Didn't tell me.

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.679
The boss's wife thought I was slacking.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.919
She caught me red-handed.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:36.960
No way.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.799
I have to come up with something.

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:38.519
To deal with her.

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:39.919
Come up with something.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.320
I don't really have any ideas.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.640
What are you doing?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.200
Take one more step,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.079
and I'll open the door and let the dog out.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.400
I'm telling you,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.960
there's a vicious dog inside.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.000
Not responsible if you get bitten.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.799
Well...

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.759
It's small,

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:29.079
but it's got a lot of energy.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.240
That tropical fish of yours is expensive, right?

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:37.400
Of course.

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:44.000
If one day...

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.799
someday...

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.200
there's a power outage or something,

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.079
you'd lose a lot, right?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.880
Are you threatening me?

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.599
It's fine.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:53.960
If the power goes out, I'll use coal briquettes.

00:18:12.319 --> 00:18:13.240
Why are you hiding?

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:15.039
I'm not hiding.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.079
I'm very gentle.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.920
I remember

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.440
you once told us

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:25.720
your pet shop

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:27.119
has trouble with water supply.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.920
You wanted to add another water pipe, right?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.960
Yes.

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.240
That's right.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.920
How about this—

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.759
as long as you promise us

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:37.200
not to lead any more protests,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.799
and disband that defending rights group,

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.759
just dissolve it,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.079
I'll fix your problem right away.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.799
You think you can buy me off with a water pipe?

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:46.559
You...

00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:47.799
are underestimating me.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.400
Plus a one-hundred yuan

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.519
gift card.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:58.000
Keep dreaming.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.880
Add a kilo of free-range eggs.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.119
Two kilos.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.519
Deal.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.400
Everyone, let's disperse.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.160
No more defending rights.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.839
Why are we leaving?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.480
Why?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.039
Why though?

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:20.759
It's you.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:22.559
You see, the property management has its troubles too.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.839
We all have kids.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.519
Think about it—

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:26.319
if your kid worked for property management,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.880
and people kept making trouble for him every day,

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:28.720
how upsetting would that be?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.319
Right?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.000
Besides,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.160
if we keep making a fuss every day,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.839
it disturbs the other residents too.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.519
Right?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.599
You have to think about us.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.400
Aren't we defending everyone's rights?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.559
How is that making trouble?

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:38.720
I declare

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.400
our defending rights group officially dissolved.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.039
It's over, it's over.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.839
What's going on?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.799
You started this defending rights thing.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.160
Why are you giving up halfway?

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:49.119
Yeah.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.799
I...

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.400
I'm just a dog seller.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.559
What—at a time like this?

00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:53.480
You're even speaking English now?

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.240
It's not English.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.759
I—I'm just a dog seller.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.680
I can't do this.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.799
I can't do it well either.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.759
No more defending rights.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.319
Let's go.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:00.599
Go, go, go.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.839
Don't leave!

00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:02.920
Old Meng, don't go!

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:04.680
Wait, Old Meng, if you leave—

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680
Old Meng, come back!

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.000
Explain it to us, Old Meng!

00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:08.319
Old Meng!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200
What do we do now?

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.079
What's going on?

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:13.000
In Chinese medicine, besides health,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.240
the most important thing

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:15.680
is your mood and emotions.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.160
Running water doesn't rot.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.599
A moving door hinge doesn't get worm-eaten.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.720
Look at me—

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:20.839
I'm already over sixty.

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.839
I still want to make use of my energy.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.480
Start a little business.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.119
What kind of business?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.839
Open a morning market.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.000
You probably forgot your own name.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.240
Liu Yingnian!

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.559
That's right.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.960
Your name is Liu Yingnian.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:36.480
Open a morning market.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.680
The market's name is—

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.079
Yingnian Morning Market.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.359
You...

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.480
You...

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:44.440
You...

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:04.720
Could it be him?

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.400
My classmate asked me to see a movie today.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.279
I'm heading out first.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:39.039
I need to rush home for dinner too.

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:50.839
Stop.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.640
What's up, ma'am?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.680
Can you

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:53.759
catch up to that car?

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:54.640
Get in.

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.720
Where do I sit?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.640
Hold that bunch of scallions.

00:21:57.119 --> 00:21:58.319
Please sit tight.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:21:59.279
This car of mine

00:21:59.279 --> 00:21:59.839
is nicknamed

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.599
Dougezhuang

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.400
Maybach.

00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:04.000
Your car is really fast.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.559
I've called a ride.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.519
You don't need to stay with me.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:18.680
I'm waiting for a ride too.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.799
What movie are you watching tonight?

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:25.039
"Spy Over Trash."

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.440
Isn't that movie already off?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720
Just pick another one.

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:30.960
The boss went east.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:31.880
West.

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:35.400
Suit.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.759
Looks good.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.279
Not like you can wear it anyway.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.039
My ride's here, bye.

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:43.160
My ride's here too.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.279
Follow the car ahead.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.559
Listen, ma'am,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.079
we're not young anymore.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.640
Why take things so seriously?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.599
Some things

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:37.359
are best ignored sometimes.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:39.079
Men are all like this.

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:40.079
Besides,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.240
if you really catch him,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.200
you'll actually get divorced.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:43.599
Are you crazy?

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.240
I'm not here to catch a mistress.

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.799
Hurry up.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.079
Alright.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:48.799
Hold on tight.

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:49.680
Speeding up now.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:50.519
Go.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.680
Any changes?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.880
Why are you squirming?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.759
Step on it.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:06.319
Can't step on it.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:08.160
It's electric.

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:10.799
Okay.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.400
Out of power.

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:14.559
What Maybach?

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:15.839
I wouldn't buy it for eighty cents.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:16.640
Seriously.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.839
Ma'am.

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:19.839
My scallions, ma'am.

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:21.279
Please give me the scallions.

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:52.079
Dad

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:55.079
How's the defending rights going?

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.240
No, no, no...

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:57.799
No

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.039
Can't defend, just messing around

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.720
Any results?

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:01.599
Results

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:02.359
Results

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.000
At the moment, a little

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.599
A small result

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.319
That's good then

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:13.359
Why do I feel you're not that happy?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960
No, not at all

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.720
I'm happy

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:16.480
No

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.279
Not unhappy

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:18.880
Quite happy

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:23.720
What do you think of this part?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.759
I've hated this part since I was little

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.079
Song Jiang is so hateful

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:30.680
For his own benefit

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.160
He betrayed so many brothers who trusted him

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.480
They agreed to

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:35.920
Uphold justice together

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.160
But in the end

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:39.079
For a bit of petty gain

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.599
He forgot his original intention

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.839
So annoying

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.519
No, no, no need, no need

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:45.640
Maybe Teacher Song

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.279
Maybe he had his own troubles

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:48.440
What trouble could he have?

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.400
He's just a petty man who forgets loyalty for profit

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.160
People like him

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000
I curse him

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.440
May he have no descendants

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.359
May his children be born without

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.519
a belly button

00:25:56.519 --> 00:25:57.160
No need for that

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.880
No need for that

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.880
No need, it's bad for you

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:01.160
Why?

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.160
Negative emotions

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.359
You vent them everywhere

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:06.720
That's not good either

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:07.400
Not good

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:07.960
Yes

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.519
Boiled farm egg

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.279
Have one

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.359
Hanghang

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.039
Me, I just

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.359
feel a bit lost

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.839
Lost

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:19.279
What are you lost about?

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:21.160
I think your defending rights this time

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.319
is especially right

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.240
I remember you loved meddling since I was little

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.799
Gave me lots of material for my essays

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.400
Valuable negative examples

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:32.599
I remember once

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.279
The neighbor's

00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:35.400
Uncle Zhang

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.640
Just went on a business trip

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:37.680
You noticed their home

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.920
had a strange man visiting

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:39.720
Sneaky

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.880
You thought he was a thief

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.079
Immediately

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:43.680
called Uncle Zhang

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.039
Uncle Zhang came back right away

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.839
And the next day

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.200
they got divorced immediately

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:48.119
No

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.680
There was another time

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:51.119
You were walking by the road

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.079
Saw a manhole cover left open

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:54.119
Kindly

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:55.240
put the cover back on

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.559
and put a stone on top

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.640
But

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.039
two pipe workers were inside

00:26:59.039 --> 00:26:59.880
stuck there all night

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:01.160
No signal inside

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.000
Couldn't call out

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:02.920
The next day

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.240
Police checked the cameras

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.240
and found the two men

00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:06.519
and found you too

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.279
No, no, that's not it

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.599
Isn't there anything positive?

00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:11.400
There is

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.119
Once on the bus

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:14.079
You acted bravely

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.799
Smashed a thug with a fire extinguisher

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.559
Then they said you were

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.000
guilty of excessive self-defense

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.319
and fined you several thousand yuan

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.160
All my New Year's money

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.759
Made me eat instant noodles for half a year

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.400
But

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:28.240
I was really proud

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:32.480
Wrote about it in my essays for over a year

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:35.039
Until my teacher ordered me to stop

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.119
Dad

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:39.279
Back then

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.039
In my heart

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:43.039
you were a hero

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440
This egg can't be eaten

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.440
Why?

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.000
Because

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.359
this egg is a

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.960
bad egg

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.359
What should we do about this?

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:09.920
Our home's power cuts off every day

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.119
My spouse and I

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.680
really can't take it anymore

00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:13.240
The key thing is

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.000
my spouse's ventilator

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.240
needs electricity every day

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.920
Nothing we can do

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:16.799
No way out

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:17.319
We can only

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.559
move in with my son

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:20.359
This elevator keeps breaking

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.240
My dad's legs are bad

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.480
He really can't climb stairs

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.119
No way

00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:24.200
I got him a telescope

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.039
He can only watch the ladies dance from upstairs

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.799
What dance?

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.359
The floor tiles are all broken

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.680
Eight of us in a row

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.640
now only four good legs left

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.720
And the security guards

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720
Too few

00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:36.119
We had another thief at home yesterday

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:38.079
All my gold jewelry is gone

00:28:38.079 --> 00:28:39.799
That was my dowry

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:40.319
Really

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.799
Really, all of this

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.519
could've been solved

00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:44.480
That person

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.559
shouldn't have left

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:46.039
Exactly

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:47.359
Who said I left?

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.279
Old pals,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.680
I was wrong.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:18.920
Let's start over

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:20.440
and defend our rights to the end.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.000
Okay.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.839
To the end.

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:23.000
To the end.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.799
To the end.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:25.839
Defending rights.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.559
What a coincidence.

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:05.400
We meet again.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:06.119
Stop pretending.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:07.400
Let's work together.

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:09.880
Boss, are you picking someone up?

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.599
It's almost time, he's not home yet.

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:19.039
What are you two good for?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.880
Boss lady.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.039
Um, the boss is right

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:22.200
under my nose now.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.920
This is my action plan.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.920
Please review it.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.079
Very good.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.160
Go with this plan.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.000
Li Lili.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.119
Look at them.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.960
Now look at you.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.519
You really disappoint me.

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:34.359
No, sis,

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.799
I'm here too.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:36.400
I...

00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:47.799
I really lost them this time.

00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:05.160
Bro,

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:07.079
I heard you have someone here

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:09.240
who can hack any system on Earth.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.880
Is that true?

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.000
The ceiling of human tech

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.759
is just the sole of us aliens' feet.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.160
Awesome.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.480
Quick, hack the Hubble Telescope

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.759
and the global surveillance system.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:19.920
I need to track someone.

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:20.960
That's not easy.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.519
I'll get an annual card here.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.920
I'll arrange it right away.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.839
Uncle Meng.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.880
Uncle Meng.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.039
Didn't we agree already?

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:44.599
As your uncle,

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.960
I want to live with some rock spirit.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.880
No,

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:49.680
You still took my stuff.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.839
Trying to use these

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.680
sweet bribes to break me?

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:53.759
Then you really

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.000
underestimate your uncle.

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:56.839
Gift card.

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.039
Here, take it back.

00:31:59.119 --> 00:31:59.640
Eggs.

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:00.640
Take them back.

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:02.279
There are a few.

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:03.559
I boiled them for you.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.319
No need to thank me.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.440
You're something else.

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:09.440
Aren't you afraid your pet shop

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.799
might lose water and power someday?

00:32:11.359 --> 00:32:11.880
If it comes to that,

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.880
I'll just close the pet shop.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.279
If that doesn't work,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.039
then...

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.279
I'll move out.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.079
But

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.559
their problems

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.599
you must solve.

00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:24.599
After I leave,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.319
they'll fix things for everyone—

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.400
repair the elevator,

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:28.000
pave the roads,

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.039
add more security.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:29.799
Remember,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.759
it's not because they've changed,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.960
but because

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:34.400
we were here.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.640
Old Meng, you're the coolest.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.319
So cool.

00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:41.160
Old Meng, awesome.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.319
You're the best.

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:52.599
We both lost the person.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.920
Boss lady won't fire both of us.

00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:55.799
No punishment for the crowd.

00:32:56.359 --> 00:32:57.039
Sorry,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.000
you lost the person.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.119
I didn't lose them.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.359
What do you mean?

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:11.880
How did you pull it off?

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.039
High-level connections.

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:23.000
Boss lady.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:23.519
You...

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:24.960
are fired.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:25.920
Boss lady.

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.200
Give me another chance.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.759
I don't want to see this traitor.

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:30.240
I'm innocent.

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:31.960
Though I failed the mission,

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:34.000
I'm loyal to the boss lady.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.160
Oh, give me a break.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.839
You're the mole sent by the boss.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.799
I'm not.

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:39.920
We analyzed

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.359
your ninety-nine-page presentation.

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:43.680
Every clue in it misled us.

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:45.960
You did it to cover for the boss.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:47.359
I didn't.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.799
Still won't admit it?

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:50.079
Come on.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.720
You personally put the boss on the plane.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.440
Mole.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200
Take the mole away.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:02.240
I...

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.200
Got myself caught in the mess.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.720
Bro...

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.680
I—I forgot my bag.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.159
Bro...

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.159
Well done.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.519
It's my duty.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.000
You brought this tea, right?

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.320
Smells great.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.559
Let me try it.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.280
Sister Cai.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.239
Sister Cai.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880
Pour me a cup.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.639
Pour some tea.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.519
Still leaving?

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.679
You're already in checkmate.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.519
It's useless.

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:37.199
Why are you yelling?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.079
What's going on?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.639
With my guidance as your mentor,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.880
everyone in the neighborhood came out.

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:55.360
We voted and chose a new property manager.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.320
They're really reliable.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.840
This is the banner everyone gave me.

00:34:59.679 --> 00:35:02.119
NEIGHBORHOOD GUARDIAN

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:03.679
Nice job, Dad.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.239
This is meaningful. We should display it.

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:06.119
Really?

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.159
Dad, isn't it already displayed?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.159
I'll post this on my Moments later.

00:35:13.239 --> 00:35:14.360
Kids, remember to

00:35:14.519 --> 00:35:15.599
share, like, and comment.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.320
Okay.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.840
Well done, well done.

00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:22.880
I also won a great battle today.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.039
I should post on my Moments too.

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:25.880
What's up?

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:27.039
Let me tell you,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.079
I found out our boss

00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:30.599
has someone far away in France—

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:31.239
a romantic interest.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.320
Good thing I found out early.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.159
They're still in the platonic stage.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.119
If I'd found out later,

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.639
it would've turned into a real affair.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320
Impressive.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.000
Of course.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.920
And I also discovered

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.960
the new stealth competition fanatic at our company

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.960
is actually a mole planted by the boss.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.239
I exposed them.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.760
The boss's wife rewarded me with twenty thousand yuan.

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:51.639
I've noticed,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.840
your work skills lately have

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.280
improved by leaps and bounds.

00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:58.239
Mainly, no one pushed me before.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.480
Once this colleague showed up,

00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:01.679
my potential got dragged out.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.960
But our boss is something else.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.920
He's over forty,

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:07.880
still doing things across two continents,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.840
meeting women online.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.000
Such immature stuff.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.800
Men are boys until they die.

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:17.119
So you mean

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.239
you're a boy until you die too?

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.840
That's right.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.920
So my feelings for you

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.719
will always be like

00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:22.559
a first love.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.280
So your first love is—

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.679
It's this late already.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.199
Time to eat.

00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:35.000
Where's your mom?

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.880
Where did your mom go?

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:39.800
Mom.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.000
Mom.

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:44.760
Mom.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:48.119
Don't come back.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.800
It's all my fault.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.679
You almost died at my feet.

00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.119
But you didn't, right?

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.960
Can you stop scolding me?

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:02.960
If you scold me again,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.880
If you scold me again,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.199
I'll tear down your house, believe it or not.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.280
Forget it.

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.119
Just go.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.760
From now on, we owe each other nothing.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.360
Heaven rewards those who work hard.

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:27.960
PURE COMMUNITY

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.480
CARING FOR THE PEOPLE

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.760
NEIGHBORHOOD LIGHT

00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:36.320
Humans,

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:39.239
have a problem with blind worship.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.960
Take this guy, for example.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.239
Yesterday, everyone pointed fingers at him.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.280
But today,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.519
he's suddenly changed,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.159
becoming a hero in their eyes.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.920
What did he even do?

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.639
He just went to the property office

00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:54.880
and shouted a few times.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.119
What's so hard about that?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.199
Alright.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.599
I need to

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.639
change this bad habit of humans

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:04.920
and set him straight.
