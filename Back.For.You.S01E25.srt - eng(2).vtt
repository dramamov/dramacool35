00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.040
Take care, Chen.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.160
What did you just call me?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.480
From now on,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.840
you're my Chen.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.520
Bye.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.480
What am I even doing?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.080
How did I become friends with Ren Nan?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.280
Can this change what happens
fifteen years from now?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.720
Will Su Ruo still end up with Ren Nan?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.120
Probably not.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.200
Seems like it can't.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.760
Chen.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.800
How did your exam go?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.440
Not so great.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.480
I did even worse than you.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.080
You sure have a good attitude.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.560
Chen.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.000
Let me tell you something.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.720
Isn't this amazing?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.320
Last night after I got home,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.360
my dad actually sat down
to talk with me.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.480
He agreed to let me attend
an art college.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.080
Isn't that a surprise?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.200
Congrats!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.320
Chen.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.440
Chen.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.680
If I get famous, I won't forget you.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.760
Everyone in our class,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.160
come to my concert.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.200
Tickets are on me.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.400
Awesome.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.360
Chen.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.200
In the future,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920
you'll have a front row VIP seat.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.160
Right next to Jay Chou.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.960
If he gets into a music college,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.800
he won't inherit his dad's company.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.720
So he won't run it badly.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640
Then he won't marry Lou Yuting.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320
If that's the case,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.800
will Su Ruo's fate change?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.080
It worked.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.160
I did it.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.880
I did it.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880
I did it.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Wait, Chen,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.800
why are you so excited all of a sudden?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.920
I'm sitting next to Jay Chou.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.360
How could I not be excited?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.920
I've already given you plenty
of encouragement.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.760
That's enough.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.200
Let me stress one thing.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.280
This is the last mock exam.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.320
Next time

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.400
is the Gaokao.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.320
Why are you spacing out?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.640
I'm just happy.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.440
I can finally retire in glory.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840
Do your best.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.280
Got it.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.240
Don't worry.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.000
Did you forget

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.560
I still have my second form.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.200
What are you whispering about?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.160
Try it in the Gaokao exam room.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.840
The exam begins.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.760
Make good use of your time.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.960
Looks like you didn't do so well.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.280
445

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.800
Should be enough for art college, right?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.200
271

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.240
Should be fine for Gaokao retake, right?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.760
Yu Xingchen.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.120
You only got 150?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.600
Chen.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.280
150 points.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.120
Did you get a perfect score in math?

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.480
All four subjects add up to 150.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560
Looks like your other form
can't come back yet.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.200
Hurry and bring him back.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400
I'm begging you.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.720
Yu Xingchen, don't be upset.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.160
I remember last time,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.800
you scored 550.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.680
So this time,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.920
you just weren't in the right state.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.840
Statistically speaking,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.000
getting every multiple choice wrong

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.280
is actually pretty impressive.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.440
Did you know the right answers

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.560
and get them wrong on purpose?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.000
Chen.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.920
Did you fight with your parents too?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.280
You did it on purpose, right?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.440
Stop talking, you guys.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.560
I want to be alone.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.840
Did you tell him about you and Yu Xingchen?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.440
I think his situation

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.360
is probably like yours.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Something must've affected his mood.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.360
I had already decided

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.560
what to say to him.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.480
But seeing him like this,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.720
I'm afraid if I really tell him,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.000
he'll have to retake the Gaokao.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.400
Look,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.920
the first time was one day.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.400
The second time was two days.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.560
The third time lasted longer.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.600
About fifteen days.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.520
Last time was also fifteen days.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
That shouldn't be.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.720
This time it's stretched to sixteen days.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.920
I should've gone back by now.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.440
If I don't go back in another half month,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.440
I'll have to take the Gaokao here.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.840
Wouldn't my life be ruined?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.720
Did you see how he looked at me?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.640
I saw it.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.400
Confused, resentful, conflicted, helpless.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.440
You should be saved.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.200
But I think I'm really doomed.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.040
As expected,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.400
the end of science is...

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.160
God, please let me go back.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.440
Do I need some kind of ritual?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.920
Go back.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.720
What is he doing?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.800
Darn it, darn it.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.440
I think he's lost it.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.800
Go back.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.120
Go back.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.560
Son.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.880
What are you doing up so late?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.600
I want to stay up all night.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.840
Trying to get that dizzy feeling.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.000
Maybe that'll solve the problem.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000
Son, don't put too much pressure
on yourself.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.480
You should go rest early.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.400
You'll study better with energy tomorrow.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.240
Exactly.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.800
I'll give you something good.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.720
Back then, I took the adult college exam.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.480
I was really nervous during the exam.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.400
It was much tougher than what you face now.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.640
Whenever I got tired of studying,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.720
I would read this book.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.440
Universal Gravitation

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.720
Yu Xingchen

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.760
Compared to the universe,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.920
we are truly insignificant.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.480
The Gaokao is important,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.520
but it shouldn't be your only goal.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.160
I mean, son,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.320
even if you mess up the exam,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.680
though I believe my son

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.040
definitely won't mess it up.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.920
Even if, worst case scenario,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.160
you fail the exam,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.480
we will still love you.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.040
Hui Ge, let me ask you something.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.520
Be honest with me.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.400
If I start studying seriously now,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.400
and you’re willing to help me fully,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.480
do I still have hope for the Gaokao?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.280
Of course you do.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.280
You really do.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.720
Just follow my method and study systematically.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.320
By this time next year,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.400
getting into a first-tier university
is absolutely possible.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.400
Next year?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.400
Gaokao retake.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.400
What did you expect?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.840
A few days ago,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.080
I had a physical checkup.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.160
Everything was normal.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.400
Very good.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.600
Very good.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.160
If this were in the past,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.840
someone would have asked me,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.600
"Why did you get a checkup?"

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.360
Now, no one asks anymore.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.520
I feel relieved.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.400
Because in your eyes,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.680
I don't see anything unnecessary.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.840
Only the Gaokao matters.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.760
Let me say a few words now.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.640
This year,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.800
ten million people are taking the Gaokao.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.520
Of those, nine million nine hundred thousand

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.160
are candidates from other provinces.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.160
That means

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.960
your real competitors are just one hundred thousand.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.960
And among these one hundred thousand,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.200
one thousand get direct admission.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.960
Two thousand have no hope for future jobs.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.880
They give up right away.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.920
Eight thousand take the exam unprepared.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.040
Nine thousand can't perform normally.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.800
One thousand will be late.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.440
Forty-five thousand

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.720
won't apply to the same school as you.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.600
Teacher Jiang,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600
did you copy this speech?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.720
I've heard it several times already.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.640
Can't you make up something heartfelt yourself?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.160
Yu Xingchen,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.600
you seem to have some thoughts on what I said.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.080
Teacher Jiang means

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.800
not to let us be blindly optimistic,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.440
but rather,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.160
we shouldn't care about other competitors.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.520
The real target to beat

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080
is ourselves.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480
It's just a bit of motivational talk.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.600
See? See?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.240
Someone actually listens to what I say.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.040
Chen is right.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.200
Teacher Jiang,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.680
Yu Xingchen,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.920
I've seen your grades.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.160
The gap is quite big.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.360
But don't worry.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.400
Just perform at your usual level.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.840
I believe you can do it.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.960
Teacher Jiang,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.000
please take care of yourself too.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.720
What's wrong?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.960
I can't solve any of these problems.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.280
I really can't take it anymore.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.040
I think I'm done for.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.680
That's nothing.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.800
Look,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.680
Yu Xingchen scored 150 and didn't cry.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400
Don't mention Yu Xingchen to me.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.200
At this moment,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.240
caring about her will only make her feel worse.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.120
Let her be alone for a while.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.600
What am I afraid of?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.560
Even if I have to retake the Gaokao,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.480
what's there to be afraid of?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280
I've already lived through these fifteen years once.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.440
What am I afraid of?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600
After coming back so many times,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.600
I've never really

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.800
fit in here.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.560
I've never tried to study properly.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.360
Never attended class seriously.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.040
Never did the morning exercises properly.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.880
Never looked again

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.680
at what I've already lost.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.080
Maybe there's not enough time.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.360
But I should seize

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.440
this rare opportunity.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.920
To experience again what I've long forgotten.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.280
Besides Su Ruo,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.560
this is also

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.080
the meaning of starting over for me.
