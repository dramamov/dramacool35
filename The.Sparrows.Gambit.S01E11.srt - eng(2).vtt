[Episode 11]

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.260
Dad, about last night...

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.100
Shut up!

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.420
Must you always make such a scene?

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.980
With a mind like yours,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.260
are you trying to ruin
your own engagement?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.940
Last time,
because you couldn't hold your tongue,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.820
our shipments through the dock

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.740
have been cut by more than half.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Must you always be so forgetful?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.140
It's not like that! Dad.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.900
Keep the Blycher Hotel's account book
in proper order.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.380
Lock it in your room.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.620
No one is allowed to enter.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.380
Am I disturbing you?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.620
Not at all.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.940
Come.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.660
Come over.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.460
Have some tea.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.060
You may go.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.700
So, are you settling in comfortably?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300
Quite comfortable.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.820
Good.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.900
By the way,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940
the Chamber of Commerce election
is approaching.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.780
Tomorrow,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.940
I wish to host a banquet here at home

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.940
for my Chamber colleagues.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.540
Go and prepare thoroughly.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.940
At the same time,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.980
I intend to announce

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.540
our marriage.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.180
Sure.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.300
Everyone.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.180
It is an honor

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.780
that you could take time

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.300
to attend my family banquet.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.620
First, today,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.220
I wish to thank you all

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.060
for your long-standing support.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.500
Thank you.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.180
Secondly,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.420
I want to announce

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.300
two most joyous occasions
for our Wang family,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.700
the marriage of my daughter

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.180
to Chen Wenbin,
son of Military Governor Chen,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.020
and

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.420
my own marriage to Liu Rumeng.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.100
Rumeng,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.500
these are Wang family heirlooms.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.180
Put the rings on both of them.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.780
Okay.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.380
Rumeng, come with me.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.140
Wenbin,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.980
from now on,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.340
we are family.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.700
Wonderful!

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.100
Mr. Li.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.740
Mr. Wang, congratulations!

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.700
Thank you, thank you.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.620
Mr. Li,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.860
regarding

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.020
the Chamber of Commerce matter,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.100
what is your view?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.020
Mr. Wang,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.940
the merchants are all upstanding.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.580
Not that you aren't upstanding enough,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.540
but this drink of yours...

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.300
I dare not accept it.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.420
It's just a drink,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.420
for good fortune.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.540
I toast you.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.500
Then this drink from Miss Liu,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.820
I shall savor it properly.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.580
Congratulations.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.900
Your first love
is now your mother-in-law.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.980
Though it seems
she doesn't want to go with you.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.900
What's the plan?

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.140
I'll go freshen up. Excuse me.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.660
Enough talk. Go help her first.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.020
Mr. Li, about our matter,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.340
you really must lend your support.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.980
Keep a close watch.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.380
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.460
- What's that sound?
- What's happening?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.500
Why are you here?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.500
What's going on?

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.980
Let's go.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.780
I don't know.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.500
Was it just for this?

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.740
You're injured?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.780
I'm fine.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380
Are you two alright?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.740
Hurry, let's go.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.420
People are coming this way, quick!

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.860
Go!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.900
A gun?

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.780
Go search!

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.260
Well...

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.620
As the Wang family's concubine,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.900
if everyone were to see

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.380
you with your son-in-law,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.900
how would you ever marry into the Wangs?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.500
What are you doing?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.100
Shoot me.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.580
Otherwise, my injury has no explanation.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.140
Chen Wenbin!

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.820
What are you doing?

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.180
Liu Rumeng

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.380
is to become
the Wang family's concubine.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.180
I know.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.980
Sir,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.020
Marshal Chen had too much to drink.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.220
He mistook me for Wan'er, that's why...

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.580
Is that so?

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.780
A thief broke into the house.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.780
Rumeng,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.300
I was worried about your safety,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.380
so I rushed over to check.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.140
I'm glad you're unharmed.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.460
Wan'er,

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.220
check quickly

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.020
if there's anything in the room

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.220
that shouldn't be here.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.020
We wouldn't want to wrong
an innocent person.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.220
Guards!

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.580
Search the room.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.380
Wenbin,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.180
do you mind

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.140
if we search you?

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.380
Just for safety's sake.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.100
Take it out.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.460
This is what you

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.140
left with me at The Paramount.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.980
You haven't forgotten, have you?

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.180
Liu Rumeng, you...!

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.860
What's going on?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.380
Sir! Miss Wang!

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.220
Someone was seen fleeing
from Miss Wang's room!

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.180
There's blood on the floor!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.740
After them, quickly!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.540
Mr. Wang,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.140
your house is quite lively tonight.
