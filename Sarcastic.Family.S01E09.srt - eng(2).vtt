00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.439
Welcome.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.879
Do you prefer cats or dogs?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.640
Uncle, I'm Li Cai.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.519
Li Lili's younger brother.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.640
So you are...

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.640
Lili's younger brother.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.439
Come in, please.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.240
Have a seat.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.800
The slops drink Lili gave me—

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.240
That drink.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.520
Slops drink.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.159
You made it?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.919
I made it.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.000
You two get along well.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.319
Why does it feel like I'm being pranked?

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:19.879
This...

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.479
By the way, Uncle—

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.960
My sis made this lunch for you.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.960
Please try it.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.919
It's fine.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.400
My sis said her cooking improved.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.280
Forget I said that.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.680
It's okay.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360
I have instant noodles.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.000
It's fine, really.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.360
I made this drink.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.840
No, no, no.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.439
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.319
There's instant noodles.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.599
What are you listening to?

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.039
Listening to it talk to you.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.840
Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What—what did it say?

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.560
It told me—

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.680
This alpaca's pen used to—

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.520
Need cleaning once a day.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.560
Now it's cleaned every three days.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.360
Is this lousy pet shop going under?

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.199
The alpaca's right.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.240
Such a big pet shop—

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.560
Only me as a temp worker.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.520
It's exhausting.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.400
Alpacas are so straightforward.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.080
Eat, poop, repeat.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.879
I'm doing two people's work alone.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.840
Boss Meng.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.919
Have you thought about giving me a raise?

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.199
You two are playing off each other.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.080
You two said it—

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Not the alpaca, right?

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.080
It was the alpaca.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.240
I'm just its mouth stand-in.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.360
Uncle Meng.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.560
I think what it said makes sense.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.639
For animals to grow—

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.919
They need a good environment.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.840
Only with a good environment—

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.800
Can they be healthy.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.319
You're so good with animals—

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.879
Why not help out here?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.840
Really?

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.039
Why are you excited?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280
He's making you work for free.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.520
How is it free labor?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.280
Think about it—

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.719
At those cat cafés or dog cafés—

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:56.479
Petting cats and dogs—

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.479
You have to pay them, right?

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.879
Here, you don't spend a cent.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.919
Exactly.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.120
So I save money.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.560
Isn't that like earning money?

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.879
That logic checks out.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:04.719
That's what I'm saying.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.919
See, this kid is smart.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.960
Alright, alright.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.439
If both sides agree, it's fine.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.879
Anyway, more help for me.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:10.680
That's not a bad thing.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.240
So—

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.080
Your pay—

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.479
Shouldn't you give some back?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.480
No, no, no.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.040
No.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.959
No.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.399
It's down.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720
It's down, it's down.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.120
How is it down?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.279
Isn't it still in the tree?

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.040
Yeah.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.680
The cat's down.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.040
Dad.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.279
The cat's down—

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.759
But my brother's still up there.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.120
My cat is purebred.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.319
It's worth ten or twenty thousand.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.199
My brother's purebred too!

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.079
Not pure.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.480
No, Dad—

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.920
How could you let him—

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.839
Do something so dangerous?

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.480
No—

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.160
You really can't blame me for this.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.000
Originally—

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.639
The cat was fine in the cage.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.120
He said cats shouldn't be caged.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.240
Cats need freedom.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.160
So he opened the cage.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.000
As soon as it opened—

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.959
The cat bolted out.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.720
I hadn't even reacted—

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:00.959
And your brother bolted out too.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.759
Yeah.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.279
Now it's not stuck in the cage—

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.720
It's stuck in the tree.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.399
Stop with the sarcastic comments.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.480
I'm warning you—

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.560
If anything happens to our kid—

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.160
You owe me emotional damages.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.519
Now it's your kid?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.600
This kid—

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.279
Don't rush to jump.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.000
Find a better spot.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.120
Slow, slow down.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:31.560
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.680
Is that okay?

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:39.800
Sis, I'm fine.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.519
It's all good now.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.560
This kid is really strong.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.480
Next time the cat climbs a tree,
it's up to you again.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.439
Dad.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:49.680
Let's not have a next time.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.480
There won't be a next time.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.079
Exactly.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.759
Stop picking on the honest kid.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.759
Making him do such risky work.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.920
You need to pay extra.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.120
Mom.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:02.800
Bro.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.079
How about we find a proper job?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360
I disagree with that.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.000
My job isn't improper at all.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.439
It doesn't even pay a salary.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:10.839
How is that a proper job?

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.120
Kid.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.480
Go work for a big company.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.519
You can earn more there.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.920
I'm not going to a big company.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.040
Big companies

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:18.240
will restrict my freedom.

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:19.160
See?

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.920
See?

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.680
Alright.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.800
You're free now.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.759
So this

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.439
goes back to our alpaca first.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.199
Cai.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.399
Have you ever heard this saying?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.800
The greater the ability,

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:32.680
the greater the responsibility.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.759
Never heard it.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.240
What's up?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.560
Here's the thing.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.079
There's a saying that goes like this:

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.560
The greater the ability,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.560
the greater the responsibility.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.000
Heard it now?

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.040
Heard it now.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.720
Let me ask you.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.920
Now that you're at home,

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.319
you have no responsibilities, right?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.199
Yeah, that's great.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:51.839
No need to be responsible.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:52.720
You have no responsibility.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.519
Does that mean you have no ability?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.040
That's not true.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.040
I've got plenty of ability.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.000
Darn it, that's it.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.120
With so much ability,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.800
shouldn't you take on big responsibilities?

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.519
We can't waste talent at home.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.199
We should go out and do something.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.279
Aren't I wasting it at home?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.240
I've got so much ability,

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.560
so I should take on big responsibilities.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.000
Right.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.279
How do I take on big responsibilities?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.079
I should go to a big company.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.600
That's right.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.360
I'm going to look for a job.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.480
Good for you.

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:14.759
Do you have a resume?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.279
No.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.959
Ask your brother-in-law.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:17.759
Let him make one for you.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.439
He's got experience.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.120
Right.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.439
That's his responsibility.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.160
Go ahead.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.480
That's not my responsibility.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.040
But it shows your ability.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.079
I'll go find him.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.879
Don't make each word in your title
a different color.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.839
It looks so much better this way.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:50.879
All those bright colors.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.360
What's up with your photo?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.560
Isn't that what you told me?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.360
Wear your best outfit for the photo.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.639
Your best outfit

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.120
is the Ultraman bodysuit.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.920
Yeah.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.199
Wait, wait, wait...

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.399
This specialty—this needs to change.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800
What did you even write here?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.560
Can drink cola through my nose.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.720
Can recite all Ultraman names.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.720
Didn't shower for two and a half years.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.920
What kind of skills are these?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.360
How are these not skills?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.480
Let me ask you two—

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.319
Can either of you do any of these three?

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.519
Honestly, no.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
Darn it, that's it then.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:23.680
No, wait.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.439
I have another skill to add.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.759
I can keep

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.000
cross-eyed for half an hour straight.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.279
Stay cross-eyed nonstop.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.960
Delete that right now.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.559
Sis,

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.399
are you jealous of my skills?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.919
Jealous of you?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.919
I want to hit you.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.519
Talk to the kid

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.440
a little nicer, will you?

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:44.159
Now you want to play the good guy.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.600
You never care any other time.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:46.399
Listen to me—

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.799
When I teach him, don't butt in.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.159
If something goes wrong, it's on you.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.480
His weird thinking is just like yours.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:51.440
Like me? How is it like me?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.320
It's all the environment's fault.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.039
You rubbed off on him.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.679
Enough, enough.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:54.600
You two, stop arguing.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:55.720
Try to be mature.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.759
Okay?

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.559
If there's a problem,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.360
I'll take responsibility.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.000
Forget it, forget it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.080
Write whatever you want.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.480
Show off your talent.

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.279
I think your brother's an idiot.

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:05.879
You're the idiot.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.200
I'm telling you, watch your mouth.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480
I think sharing our experiences with him

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.600
is totally useless.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.039
He'll still make the same mistakes.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.320
Aren't I worried he'll suffer?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.840
Suffer?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.519
You have to suffer to learn.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.240
Every young person goes through this.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.840
So why repeat our mistakes?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.519
The paths we've already taken—

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.679
If we can avoid them, why not?

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.200
Done writing.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.279
All finished.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.399
Let's figure out which company to apply to.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.240
No need to think about it.

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.679
I've already sent out a hundred resumes.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.799
To HR at all the big companies.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.240
Next,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.679
it's their turn to fight over me.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.360
Tell me—

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.360
if they really start fighting for me,

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:48.960
should I go to

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.919
Tencent

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.120
or Apple?

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.200
That's the question.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.159
Tencent.

00:09:58.919 --> 00:09:59.679
Apple.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.240
Come in.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:12.440
Come in, Xiao Li.

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.000
Have a seat.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.679
Looks like the expert we hired

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.679
was really accurate.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.360
Said we'd have important guests.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.279
And here they are.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.000
They're all top graduates.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.840
Call each one quickly.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.799
Pick the best one.

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.159
Send out the offer letter fast.

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.279
Tsinghua, Peking, Stanford—

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.080
all fighting to work for us.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.679
That's because of Three No's and One Creation.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.559
Three steps, one crash.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.120
Wouldn't that kill you?

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.600
It's our company's new philosophy.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:41.960
The Three No's and One Creation concept.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.240
Read it and you'll see.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.240
Our company is led by an academician.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.480
About to go public.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.919
Strictly follows

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.919
no overtime,

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.720
no rat race,

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.720
no internal strife—the Three No's.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:57.519
We offer employees a flexible,

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.399
diverse growth platform.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.240
Create

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360
the greatest value in life.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720
Three No's and One Creation, right?

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.799
So when you communicate,

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.000
on this basis,

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:06.679
be sure to

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.240
raise our company's image

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:09.360
even higher.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.919
No, but—

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:13.159
We're using this to lure people in.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:15.679
Once they're hired,

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.679
how do we deliver on it?

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:19.080
Don't worry about that.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.200
I'm number one at making empty promises.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.840
No way I can't keep talent.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.879
Plus,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.159
my wife loves me so much.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.799
How could I not work hard?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.159
That's true.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.240
Of course.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:31.360
And then

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.039
For those who didn't make it,

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.240
send them a rejection letter too.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.279
Just say their information

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.360
is now in our talent pool.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.960
Darn it, maybe we'll work together
in the future.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.720
Make it sound gentle.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.200
Our company's talent pool—

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.039
where is that, anyway?

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.720
We don't even have such a thing.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.559
Doesn't it make us look professional?

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.000
Just toss these two out.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.279
No need to send a rejection letter.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:53.720
Waste of electricity.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.039
Especially this one.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.799
This one looks neither human nor ghost.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.679
This one.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.600
Isn't that okay?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120
I think it looks fine.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.039
It's so colorful.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.120
See?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.200
Just throw it away.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.440
No need.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.639
Isn't this—

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.159
It has

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.480
design, right?

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.399
I think it's creative.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.559
Fury makes my hair stand on end.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.559
By the railing,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.320
as the rain stops.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.480
I look up.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.600
I cry out to the sky.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.960
My heart burns with passion.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.840
Thirty years of fame, now dust and dirt.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.879
Eight thousand miles under clouds and moon.

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:40.159
Don't waste your youth.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.399
Let your hair turn white young.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.639
Only regret remains.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.799
What's wrong with him?

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:53.200
He sent out one hundred resumes.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.919
Got ninety-nine rejection letters.

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:59.320
Feels like no one understands him.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.519
His greatest ambition.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.000
He empathizes with Yue Fei.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:06.720
This kid—

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:08.360
Did he get hit too hard?

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:10.679
Maybe he's having mental issues?

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.840
I told you your brother's a fool.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:48.480
Hello.

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:51.360
Yes, this is Ideal Design.

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:52.720
Let me ask you,

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.559
why did you choose our company?

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:57.039
I heard this job has flexible hours.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.919
No need to clock in.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.840
That's right.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.879
It's super flexible.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.120
Yesterday at 3 a.m.,

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.559
my boss asked me for a proposal.

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:04.519
The main thing is being unpredictable.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:10.159
The company benefits are great.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.600
We offer five insurances and one fund.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.759
You sign a labor contract,

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.320
and also a non-compete agreement.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:17.080
Your interests are fully protected.

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:18.720
A non-compete agreement?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.399
What does a non-compete mean?

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:21.440
After you leave,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.320
you can't work in renovation anymore.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.159
Even changing a bulb at home—

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.240
better be careful.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.399
Could lead to legal trouble.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.480
But I don't think you need to worry.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.080
Just don't quit, and it's fine.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.320
Got another one done.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.120
The company has a shuttle bus.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.279
You have your own car?

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.600
That's even more convenient.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.919
Let me check your address.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.039
You live downtown.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.159
Our company is moving soon.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.159
If there's no traffic,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.360
from your home to the office

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480
is just three hours.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.360
Why is the job market

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.399
so hot right now?

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:13.879
They all joined other companies.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.600
It's your Three No's and One Creation.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.440
Didn't create it right.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.080
I did create it.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.720
I created each one.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:20.279
So—

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.159
Why did they all leave?

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.480
Not all of them left.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.240
There's still one here.

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:28.600
Why don't I remember this one?

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.759
Looks pretty smart to me.

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:32.879
I missed this person.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:33.600
Yeah.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.480
I thought it was a pity at the time.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.639
I talked to this guy.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:38.840
His skills

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:40.159
match our company's strength

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.399
really well.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.440
Mainly, he really appreciates

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.720
your Three No's and One Creation.

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.559
And

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.120
he asks for a low salary.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:49.120
Contact him quickly.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:49.799
Call him.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.840
We're hiring a project assistant anyway.

00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:52.519
Doesn't matter.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:54.240
Don't waste any more time.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.399
Our main focus

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:56.559
is President Wang's project.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.360
Okay.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.159
I'll contact him right now.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.440
Three No's and One Creation.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:02.440
I'll put more effort into creating.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.799
Right.

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:03.080
Okay.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.080
Create him.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.840
Cai.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.600
Cai, you must do well tomorrow.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.840
Our boss lately—

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.840
is worried about a project.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:21.080
Don't make him upset.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.399
I'm telling you,

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.679
remember this.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.919
This job wasn't easy to get.

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:28.759
You have no idea behind the scenes

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:30.159
how much I've worked for you.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.720
It's all for you.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:33.840
Th-this—

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.120
Why are you crying now?

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.759
No, sis—

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:39.759
You worked too hard.

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:41.159
I'm so touched.

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.039
You kid—

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.759
With your grateful heart,

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.480
I'm already very moved.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.320
Don't cry, it's okay.

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:52.240
I'm hanging up.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.720
Fight monsters.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.679
Worked too hard.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.680
This is the office area.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.759
Usually, with your colleagues,

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.039
get along well with everyone.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.079
Learn more from others.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.960
Don't always stand with your hands behind your back.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.359
Are you acting like a boss here?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.680
Be a bit more humble.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.400
Up ahead is the break room.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.000
There's tea and coffee.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.480
You can have cold or hot water.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.440
This is the copy room.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.519
If you have any documents

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.000
to print or copy, do it here.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.599
This is the general manager's office.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:36.000
You—

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:43.720
What are you doing here?

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:45.680
Sis.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:47.759
Sis, look.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.440
What are you doing?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.119
ID photo.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.519
Can you do something serious?

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:55.400
Do you know how hard it was

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.559
to get this job here?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.200
I know.

00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:58.759
You know?

00:17:58.759 --> 00:17:59.400
Yeah.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.920
There were so many people

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.640
competing for this position with me.

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:03.319
Do you know why I stood out?

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:03.960
Do you know?

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:05.559
Why?

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:06.759
It's because

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.880
I didn't write my resume

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.720
the traditional way like you did.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.720
My resume

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.599
was unique.

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:13.559
So the boss valued my talent.

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:14.839
That's why at work

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.880
I can't just follow the rules like you.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.799
Otherwise, I'd just become

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:20.240
an ordinary corporate slave.

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.000
Wait, who are you talking about?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.359
Of course, I don't mean you, sis.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.079
Don't call me sis.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.319
Sis.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.079
Everyone else is working overtime.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.279
But you two are just arguing here.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.799
I heard you from far away.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.839
Chattering nonstop.

00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:36.839
Xiao Li, who is this?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.079
You know my name is Xiao Li?

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:38.680
This is my sis.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680
I'm Xiao Li.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.599
This is our company's new assistant.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.519
I'm showing him around.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.279
This kid is really sweet-talking.

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.319
Calls everyone "sis."

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:51.279
Really?

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:52.039
No, auntie.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.960
Not sis.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.119
You—

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:55.920
Hurry up and go.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.680
Stop messing around here.

00:18:56.759 --> 00:18:57.440
Go to work now.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:57.920
Time to work.

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.160
Hurry up, it's busy.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:00.960
Get to work, get to work.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.400
Didn't I tell you this was the third draft?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.519
Why did you send the fourth draft to the boss?

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:22.839
It's the fourth draft.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.880
I revised one draft.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.640
So it's the fourth draft.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.480
Why does an assistant get to change my design?

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.079
No—

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.599
An assistant

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.480
is supposed to help fix what's unreasonable.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:31.960
Um—

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.880
Sorry, sorry.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:33.920
I need you for something urgent.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.279
Come.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:34.920
Sorry.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.759
Hurry, hurry.

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:41.319
What are you doing over there?

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:42.319
Designing.

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:43.319
Isn't this a design company?

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:45.920
What kind of design is that?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.400
Colleagues are already stressed working overtime.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.039
Don't make things worse.

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:50.759
No—

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:53.160
The boss picked me out of thousands.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.960
For what reason?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.839
Just to have me print documents every day?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.920
He must want me to lead a big project.

00:19:58.079 --> 00:19:59.599
You even burn instant noodles.

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.039
And you want to lead a project?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.880
I've already led one.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.160
I've sent out the company's guidelines.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.200
I've already distributed them.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.759
What guidelines?

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:08.559
I posted them in the group, didn't you see?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.240
I even tagged everyone.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.720
Can you check the group promptly at work?

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:21.839
Delete it right now.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.079
Why delete it?

00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:25.119
I get what you mean.

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:26.039
Don't worry.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.559
If I become a department head,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.799
I'll promote you first.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.480
You, a leader?

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:31.880
No, do you really think

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.480
the boss hired you for your genius?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.759
That's why you got the job?

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:35.559
Otherwise, why?

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:38.519
Fine.

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:39.519
I can't deal with you anymore.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.160
I'm taking you to see the boss now.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.359
Let's talk this out.

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:42.759
Come.

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:44.200
Come.

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.119
What for?

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.640
Come in.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.519
Boss.

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.279
I was just looking for you, Xiao Li.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.119
What's up, President Li?

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.519
I'm looking for Xiao Li.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.680
Still pretending to be calm, huh?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.519
It's about you.

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:07.720
The folks from design just now

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.759
already reported everything to me.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.119
See?

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.240
You randomly posted stuff in the work group.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.319
President Li already knows.

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.640
Of course I know.

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.359
Thanks to Xiao Li,

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.160
we managed to save such a big project.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.640
It's what I should do.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000
W-what's going on?

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:26.440
You don't know about President Wang's project?

00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:27.720
I do know.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.680
His villa.

00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.880
His eight-year-old son was never satisfied, right?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.200
So I couldn't figure it out.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.839
Luckily, Xiao Li

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.400
pointed out the real issue.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:37.759
The design team just now

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:39.559
sent the latest plan to President Wang.

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:40.400
Father and son

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.519
were very satisfied.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.400
You really get design.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:45.920
Yeah.

00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.160
I spotted it right away.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.400
President Wang's son's bedroom

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.279
had design issues.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.240
Look here.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.440
The designer put in a bunch of Ultraman.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.680
But they were all wrong.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:55.920
Belial,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.160
Camearra, and Tregear

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.200
are all from the evil side.

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.240
How could you include them?

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:00.000
And also,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.519
the background is the M78 Nebula.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.960
They added people from the O50 Nebula

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.200
and the L77 Nebula

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.799
into the design.

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:06.599
How could the kid not get mad?

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:07.720
See?

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:08.839
It's all technical terms.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.759
Very professional.

00:22:10.599 --> 00:22:13.319
I'm planning to sign the contract with President Wang this weekend.

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:14.240
Finalize the details.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.400
I have to bring you, the hero.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:16.960
Sure.

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:19.000
Get up.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.400
I'm up.

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.160
Li Lili,

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:24.319
you contributed too.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.359
Thanks to your advice,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.599
otherwise we would've missed out

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.759
on such a great talent.

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:30.920
Right?

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.359
Well,

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:32.079
It's what I should do.

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:32.599
By the way, you—

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:34.240
Why did you come in to see me?

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.920
It's about this.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.039
This matter.

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.000
So it's settled, isn't it?

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.480
If there's nothing else,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.160
get back to work.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.880
Let's go.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.599
No, that's not what I meant.

00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:02.079
Did you two get what I said?

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:05.359
My boss wants to focus on training him now.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.400
They're grooming him for a management role.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.079
Darn it, isn't that settled?

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.559
Isn't that a good thing?

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:12.480
Your brother's job is stable now.

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.759
The boss really values him.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.759
Isn't that great?

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.240
No wonder he's been talking to me lately.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.319
That's different now.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.319
He talks to me while cleaning the litter.

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:21.759
Calibrate the granularity.

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:23.279
Do structural optimization.

00:23:23.599 --> 00:23:24.279
What does that mean?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.640
It means the cat litter doesn't clump.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.480
Did it clump together?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.799
He leveled it out with the scoop.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.519
That's a good thing.

00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:32.319
I think it's pretty good.

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:33.039
Just think about it.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.440
When someone is capable,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.720
you can pile on the responsibility.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.519
When you give responsibility,

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:38.799
their ability shoots up.

00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:39.920
That's a good thing.

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.400
What ability does he have?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.960
He just got lucky this time.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.279
If he becomes a leader later,

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.960
won't he cause even bigger trouble?

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:49.240
No, listen to yourself.

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:50.359
How can you be sure

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:51.559
he'll definitely mess up?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.799
You have to give him a chance to prove himself.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.160
Let him grow freely.

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:56.559
How do you know the path you chose

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.599
is really right for him?

00:23:59.400 --> 00:23:59.880
Right.

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.920
There's a song that goes like this.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.759
There's a kind of love called letting go.

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:04.599
One.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.359
Two.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.079
One.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.559
Two.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:07.039
Go.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.240
There's a kind of love—

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.359
Can you get to the point?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.519
We all know how to sing it.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.119
But it's hard to actually do it.

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:15.440
Think about why that is.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.559
Besides,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.160
Hanghang,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.960
I—

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.599
Well—

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:19.440
Resolutely let go.

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:20.519
Isn't that good?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.119
Isn't it good?

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:22.079
Dad, that's not it.

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:24.039
You're just plain lazy.

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:26.960
So you mean to say

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:29.160
my brother is actually capable,

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:30.799
I just never noticed?

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:31.720
Yeah.

00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:32.720
Let me tell you,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.920
I think Li Cai

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.559
has a lot of good qualities.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.240
Right.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:36.960
For example,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.680
when he worked at our pet shop,

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:41.519
he could listen to the alpaca's feelings.

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:43.119
Really?

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.400
My dad's done this for years,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400
and he never had that skill.

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:46.960
Then you really don't know me.

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:48.240
Why did I open a pet shop?

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:48.759
It shows

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:50.559
my ability to communicate with animals

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.319
is absolutely top-notch.

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:53.920
This, uh—

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:55.480
That's way too easy.

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:57.559
Isn't that just how he is?

00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.559
Alpaca,

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.160
see?

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:02.039
How nice.

00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:03.279
Totally able to communicate.

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:04.160
Let's have a chat.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.319
See, it's not hard.

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:06.000
Today, you—

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.839
Hey, hey, don't run away.

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:07.839
Let's talk, let's talk.

00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:10.440
How are you feeling today?

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:12.319
Dad.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:12.960
Dad.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.240
Are you okay, Dad?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.920
Dad.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:20.240
Humans

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:22.480
develop affection for their family.

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.000
But today,

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:25.880
I learned an important lesson.

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:27.480
Too much care

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:29.519
can actually backfire.

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:32.559
A psychology expert once said,

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.119
in this world,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.079
all love

00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:37.000
aims to bring people together.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.519
Only one kind of love

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.839
is meant for separation.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:41.240
And that's

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.920
the love parents have for their children.

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:44.960
True, successful love

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.039
is letting children

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:48.000
become independent as soon as possible.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:51.400
Let go and let them do what they love.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.240
That way,

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.839
they can find their own

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.200
bright future.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.279
What a lousy job.

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:02.920
I'm quitting.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.440
What happened?

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.400
Why?

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.000
President Wang's dumb son—

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:08.880
he insists

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.160
Ultraman Tiga can beat Ultraman King.

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.119
Can he really win?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.039
Of course not.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:12.720
He doesn't believe it.

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:13.480
He keeps arguing with me.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.200
We started bickering.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.200
Then we got into a fight.

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:17.200
You know who's the most annoying?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.920
Your boss.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:19.359
It's one thing for a kid to be clueless,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.680
but your boss took sides.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.039
Lousy company.

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:22.680
I'm quitting.

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:25.960
What are you writing, sis?

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:28.880
Nothing at all.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.160
I suggest you quit too.

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:31.200
Everyone should just quit.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.200
Dear Interstellar Encyclopedia Editorial Team,

00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.759
On behalf of six billion Earthlings,

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.400
I present Ultraman to our home planet.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.519
He stands for justice,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.440
hope,

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:55.400
