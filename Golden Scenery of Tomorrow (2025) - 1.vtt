00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.420
No, we're supposed to do it like this…

00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:44.923
- Oh my god!
- There's the professor.

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:46.532
Let's go get her.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:49.469
Wait, Professor, don't leave!

00:00:49.493 --> 00:00:52.222
Professor, please, don't leave yet.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.288
Professor!

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:54.915
Please, our projects

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.186
Diego, your project is late.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.338
The submission deadline
was this morning.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.050
We're so sorry, Prof. It took
us a while to finish it.

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:06.112
Please...

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:08.971
We promise we will
submit on time next time!

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:13.454
They kinda remind me of me,
Luna, and Ke back in college.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:16.913
Fine.

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:19.958
But this will be the last time

00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:21.501
I'll accept any late submission.

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:22.378
Do you understand?

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:23.420
Yes, Prof! Thank you so much.

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:24.255
Thank you! Thank you so much, Prof!

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:25.779
- Thank you so much!
- You're welcome.

00:01:29.064 --> 00:01:32.011
They look so passionate
about their studies.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.580
I guess they really love architecture.

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:36.415
Good for them.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.019
Sometimes I can't help but wonder

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:41.438
if I even deserve the
opportunity to work here

00:01:41.462 --> 00:01:43.523
as an architecture professor.

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:47.027
There are so many Filipinos who
dream of being in my position,

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.929
but here I am, still not sure
if I really love what I do.

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:56.571
Hello?

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.788
Via! Where are you?

00:01:58.812 --> 00:01:59.956
Just about to leave the university.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.499
I'm heading there now.

00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:03.752
Hurry up! We're already
at the café outside the venue.

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.903
The concert starts in an hour!

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.322
Yeah, okay. See you.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:15.722
I've just been trying to go
with the flow lately

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:18.123
since I usually don't really
have anything to do.

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:32.238
He's really amazing, isn't he?

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:33.615
- Yeah!
- Stop it.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.075
Hey, Via's here.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.035
There she is.

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.368
Is this seat taken?

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:39.061
- Yes, it's free.
- Thanks.

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:40.747
What do you want? Hold on.

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.040
Huh? No, it's okay. I'm fine.

00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:43.041
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:44.501
- I got held up by a student.
- No, it's okay.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:45.359
It's fine.

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:46.565
We just got here.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.588
Don't judge us if we end up crying later

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:50.006
at the concert, okay?

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.758
I feel like my tears are ready to fall

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:54.268
once I see him and hear his voice.

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.915
I swear, I'm just gonna start crying.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.955
Come on! No big deal,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.205
I'll even hand you the tissues myself.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.311
Hey, thanks for coming even though

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:04.795
we invited you last-minute.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.191
I just couldn't convince Gab and Elena.

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:11.036
Sorry, girls, he's just not
my favorite Filipino artist.

00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:12.779
I've got so many deadlines,
you know. I'm exhausted.

00:03:12.803 --> 00:03:14.239
Like right now - Whatever, Gab.

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:15.615
I just went with the flow

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.541
and joined my friends for this concert.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.036
I don't even know the artist!

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.790
He's gonna sing
that song, My Favorite Movie.

00:03:23.814 --> 00:03:24.999
- That's my favorite!
- Hey!

00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:26.275
That's my favorite, too.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.252
You guys are so dramatic.

00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:29.921
It probably just has a similar title, right?

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:31.548
Oh, come on. Let them be.

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:34.592
Yeah, seriously. Sorry if
I'm such a big fan, okay?

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:36.970
But really, why are we
even here in Spain

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:38.179
and not in the Philippines?

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:39.556
Right? If this were back home,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.725
But I came along anyway because
I wanted to hang out with them,

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.478
to relate to the things they're into.

00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:47.897
Look at them, they're both
so happy just knowing

00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.215
they'll finally see this singer.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.401
I didn't even know it was possible

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:55.637
to feel that kind of
excitement for a celebrity.

00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:57.781
I've never felt that before.

00:03:57.806 --> 00:03:59.409
- We match.
- We kinda match, don't we?

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.310
Though I actually like Via's bag better.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:04.897
You're on brand today.

00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:16.050
Wow, we're finally here.

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:19.804
Honestly, I've never really
experienced being

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:21.747
so into something or someone

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:25.375
that it made me cry.

00:04:28.253 --> 00:04:30.714
Except maybe for one person.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.178
Oh my gosh!
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.827
Oh my gosh, I'm so
happy we got great seats.

00:04:43.852 --> 00:04:46.765
- Exactly.
- We're right in front!

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.124
Come on, Via, let's go.

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:50.067
We're so excited for you to meet Larkin!

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:51.756
Let's go.

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:53.107
You guys go ahead, I'll follow.

00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:54.525
- You sure?
- Okay then.

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:56.693
- I can't wait anymore.
- Make sure you follow, okay?

00:04:56.717 --> 00:04:58.219
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:32.295
Hey, Via, are you okay?

00:05:32.422 --> 00:05:34.215
You're sweating a lot.

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:36.799
You're not used to being around
this many people, huh?

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.698
Huh? No, I'm fine.

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:40.689
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:44.116
Don't worry, girl. Once you hear him play,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.409
you'll definitely feel better.

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:49.079
Yes, he's so good live,
you might even cry.

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:50.289
I'm getting excited.

00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:51.540
I really want to see him already.

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:53.292
- He's taking so long, right?
- Yeah.

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:55.151
Aren't they going to call him out yet?

00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:00.031
Oh my god!

00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:05.929
He's here.

00:06:05.953 --> 00:06:07.371
Larkin!

00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.449
What's up, Barcelona?

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.204
Thank you so much for inviting me here.

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:50.124
Thank you for coming here.

00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:52.850
And especially to our fellow countrymen.

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.260
Hi, I'm Larkin Sanchez.

00:06:56.504 --> 00:06:59.090
I hope it's okay if
I sing my first original song.

00:06:59.674 --> 00:07:01.676
This song is about someone

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:05.805
who wants to confess their love
to their closest friend.

00:07:08.307 --> 00:07:09.725
But at the same time

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.966
too afraid to lose everything they have.

00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:14.646
Sing with me.

00:10:41.687 --> 00:10:42.855
Mommy!

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:45.900
Hey! Aidan, wait!

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.628
What?

00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:49.380
Can I see?

00:10:49.404 --> 00:10:50.630
Milk? Yes?

00:10:50.654 --> 00:10:52.573
Such a handsome boy! Yes?

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:02.642
Kino!

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:05.395
What's wrong? Why do you
look so grumpy this early?

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:06.355
I woke up late.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:07.439
And I still have so much to do.

00:11:07.463 --> 00:11:09.316
I'm not even done yet, and
now he wants to eat...

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.442
- Hurry, Ysha!
- I'm ready!

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:11.943
I'm not even done
taking care of these two yet.

00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:13.111
Come here, you two.

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:16.031
Arkin! I got a star from
my teacher yesterday!

00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:16.908
You must be proud of yourself.

00:11:16.932 --> 00:11:18.658
It's only been a week and
you already got a star.

00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:19.826
And she didn't want to take a bath...

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.495
Good job!

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.359
Because she was scared
the star might come off.

00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.123
And you, your hair's a mess.

00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:25.833
Let's fix it, come on.

00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:27.566
Wait a minute. Let me fix this first.

00:11:28.025 --> 00:11:29.777
- I'll leave that to you.
- Here, sit down.

00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:32.363
There you go! Show me?

00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:34.216
Wear your shoes now. Okay, you do it.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.407
Give me those shoes.

00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:37.575
Via?

00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:39.495
Got any extra eggs there?

00:11:40.287 --> 00:11:41.598
Of course, I already added an extra egg.

00:11:41.622 --> 00:11:42.891
I know it's your favorite.

00:11:42.915 --> 00:11:45.519
Wow, you're the best, Via!

00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:47.253
That's why you're my best friend.

00:11:49.922 --> 00:11:50.941
The other side now.

00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:52.758
Your turn. Wear your shoes.

00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:54.384
Oh no, Via.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.197
Sorry I couldn't help you out,
I woke up late.

00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.074
No problem, Pa.

00:11:59.098 --> 00:12:00.826
I know you were tired
from work yesterday,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.160
so I didn't wake you up.

00:12:02.184 --> 00:12:04.019
It's okay, we got this.

00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:05.157
Really?

00:12:05.312 --> 00:12:06.413
We can manage.

00:12:06.438 --> 00:12:07.523
Thank you.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.251
All right then, just be careful, okay?

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:12.045
Have fun, and sweetheart...

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:13.713
If you meet any new friends,

00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:14.674
invite them over, okay?

00:12:14.698 --> 00:12:16.115
I'll prepare some snacks for them.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.309
Pa, we'll get going now.

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:26.351
- Well?
- Let's go.

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:27.835
- You guys ready?
- Here's your bag.

00:12:28.627 --> 00:12:30.605
- Ready?
- I need to pee.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:31.274
Huh?

00:12:31.298 --> 00:12:33.275
Mira, go with Ysha.

00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:35.342
Don't forget to bring
your lunch boxes, okay?

00:12:36.003 --> 00:12:37.009
Pa!

00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:38.227
Thank you.

00:12:39.972 --> 00:12:41.116
- We'll go ahead.
- Thank you.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.076
- Bye, Pa!
- Take care, okay?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.434
Kino, hurry up! Let's go!

00:12:44.977 --> 00:12:45.954
You're so slow!

00:12:45.978 --> 00:12:47.581
Really? Are you turning this on me?

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:48.832
I'm the slow one now?

00:12:48.856 --> 00:12:50.417
We're gonna be late again. Come on!

00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.377
I was just waiting for you!

00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:52.401
- All right.
- Let's go!

00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:16.759
Stop squeezing in.

00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:18.905
Here's the fare...

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:21.180
Here's the fare! Two to Valeria High.

00:13:22.056 --> 00:13:24.808
I'll pay for you this time
since you packed me food.

00:13:25.142 --> 00:13:26.870
I always pack you food though!

00:13:26.894 --> 00:13:28.371
Why are you only treating me now?

00:13:28.395 --> 00:13:30.439
Because you always pay first.

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:33.025
Excuses.

00:13:33.849 --> 00:13:34.850
Okay, fine.

00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:37.422
From now on,
I'll always pay for your fare.

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:39.907
As long as we go to
school together every day.

00:13:40.108 --> 00:13:42.844
We go to school
together everyday, don't we?

00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.679
Since pre-school even, right?

00:13:44.703 --> 00:13:46.598
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.141
And when we start working,
we'll still go together.

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:49.249
No excuses.

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:51.377
You're so clingy.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.987
It's cramped, okay?

00:14:01.011 --> 00:14:02.197
Cramped?

00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:03.222
Whatever.

00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:12.564
You're so mean, Avianna.

00:14:13.148 --> 00:14:14.316
Scoot! Move!

00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:26.662
- Hurry up! You're so slow.
- Yeah. Let's go.

00:14:27.955 --> 00:14:29.975
Wait, your lunch, hold on.

00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:31.559
I'll just grab it later from your room.

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:32.228
What?

00:14:32.252 --> 00:14:33.436
Don't you dare come to our classroom,

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.646
especially with your friends.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.171
You guys are scaring my classmates.

00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:37.358
Why? Do I...

00:14:37.382 --> 00:14:38.400
Just get it from me at the canteen later.

00:14:38.424 --> 00:14:39.800
Do I really look that scary?

00:14:41.969 --> 00:14:43.405
My classmates said

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:44.531
you look like a troublemaker

00:14:44.555 --> 00:14:46.275
and that you're always getting into fights.

00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:49.285
No way. I don't join them, I just watch.

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:51.162
I'm actually really nice!

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:53.581
Anyway, just get it at the canteen later

00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:54.542
and seriously

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:57.818
don't get into any fights,
or I'll tell Aunt Allie, okay?

00:14:58.235 --> 00:14:59.653
I won't! I promise!

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:01.339
Good.

00:15:01.363 --> 00:15:01.882
Okay.

00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:03.133
I'm heading this way.
You go that way. Bye!

00:15:03.157 --> 00:15:03.967
I'm going with you.

00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:04.844
No, it's fine!

00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:06.052
I'm taking you to your classroom.

00:15:06.076 --> 00:15:08.013
That's enough. Go already!

00:15:08.037 --> 00:15:08.764
Bye!

00:15:08.788 --> 00:15:10.181
Okay, see you!

00:15:10.205 --> 00:15:12.041
Later! At lunch!

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:16.354
Okay, class, for our art project,

00:15:16.378 --> 00:15:18.648
I want you to draw a historical site

00:15:18.672 --> 00:15:19.715
in the Philippines.

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:23.469
Don't worry, you will do it by group.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.472
Hey, it's a group project!

00:15:27.347 --> 00:15:28.348
Class, listen.

00:15:28.682 --> 00:15:30.376
You can choose your group mates.

00:15:31.143 --> 00:15:32.579
Three members for each group.

00:15:32.603 --> 00:15:34.873
This is what I hate
the most about group projects,

00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:37.333
letting us choose our own group mates.

00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:39.085
I don't really have any close friends here.

00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:40.967
And it's only been one week of classes,

00:15:40.992 --> 00:15:43.536
how am I supposed to make friends?

00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:46.342
So how did they manage

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:48.035
to get close to each other so fast?

00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.874
Rock, Paper, Scissors, whoever loses...

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.960
Hi!

00:15:58.045 --> 00:16:00.506
There's only two of us.
You wanna join our group?

00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:01.442
Huh?

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:02.901
Yes, you're joining us.

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:03.569
You're our group mate
now so I'll go ahead

00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:04.694
and write your name down.

00:16:04.718 --> 00:16:06.946
Avia… Aviana. Right?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:07.947
Did I spell it right?

00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:08.972
Double N.

00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:10.326
Double N.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.743
Why is your nickname Via?

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:13.931
Why not Ana?

00:16:13.956 --> 00:16:14.578
- Right?
- Avi, Avi.

00:16:14.603 --> 00:16:15.603
Why not Avi?

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.604
I don't know.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.503
Ma'am! Group one. We're group one.

00:16:21.527 --> 00:16:23.171
Did everybody hear us?

00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:24.131
This girl is really...

00:16:24.155 --> 00:16:25.132
There's no prize!

00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:26.133
What are you talking about?

00:16:26.157 --> 00:16:27.175
- That's just how it is.
- Okay?

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:28.760
- We'll be presenting first.
- Perfect!

00:16:28.784 --> 00:16:30.428
So if someone has a similar concept,

00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:31.346
it would look like they copied us

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.264
and not the other way around.

00:16:32.288 --> 00:16:34.307
- Aren't I smart?
- You're right!

00:16:34.331 --> 00:16:35.517
Smart, right?

00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:37.727
And with that,
she's going to be the leader.

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:39.145
- She's the leader, okay?
- Huh?

00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:40.313
- Me?
- Yes.

00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:41.147
Why me?

00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:41.689
See...

00:16:41.713 --> 00:16:42.316
- It's right there.
- Look at this.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.441
- Leader.
- Leader.

00:16:43.465 --> 00:16:45.443
Avianna. Double N.

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:46.153
- Double N.
- Chill!

00:16:46.177 --> 00:16:47.278
Hey, we're just fooling around, okay?

00:16:47.302 --> 00:16:48.072
It's all a joke.

00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:49.114
This is just how we are.

00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:50.448
What're your socials? Hurry up.

00:16:50.472 --> 00:16:51.033
- Write it here.
- Write your socials here.

00:16:51.057 --> 00:16:52.229
Write it at the back instead,

00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:52.993
we wouldn't want the teacher to see it.

00:16:53.017 --> 00:16:54.327
We're gonna create our own group chat.

00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.995
Right. Avianna, with double N.

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:59.565
Avianna, with double N.

00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:07.924
Luna: Hello, group mates! Let's gooo!

00:17:07.948 --> 00:17:09.050
Luna: Hello! Luna: Hello!

00:17:09.074 --> 00:17:10.176
Luna: Hellooo!!! Kierra: You're so noisy!

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.743
Luna: What? Just a thumbs up?

00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:18.351
- I kind of want some more.
- I don't want any.

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:20.419
Ke, Luna! Come here!

00:17:24.006 --> 00:17:26.800
Maybe later. We'll be back. Thanks!

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:30.804
Hey! Hope it's okay if we sit with you.

00:17:31.388 --> 00:17:32.598
Hi.

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:35.934
Do you usually eat alone?

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:40.647
Really? You should join us next time.

00:17:40.856 --> 00:17:43.901
Eating alone can feel sad, right?

00:17:46.028 --> 00:17:47.636
That looks so good.

00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:48.798
The way it's cooked is perfect.

00:17:48.822 --> 00:17:49.799
The yolk is fully intact.

00:17:49.823 --> 00:17:51.116
Did you cook that?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.368
You really cook?

00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:55.722
Wow.

00:17:55.746 --> 00:17:57.539
Ke, see that? She can cook.

00:17:57.998 --> 00:17:59.142
I know how to cook, too.

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:00.792
Why don't you cook for me then?

00:18:04.254 --> 00:18:05.255
Give me some.

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:12.721
This is Lance, my boyfriend.

00:18:15.349 --> 00:18:16.391
Who were you with earlier?

00:18:17.351 --> 00:18:19.245
Philip, my classmate.

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:20.946
Didn't I tell you to stay away from him?

00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.784
And where were you last night?

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.468
Huh?

00:18:24.493 --> 00:18:26.453
I didn't allow you to go.
Did I tell you to go?

00:18:26.693 --> 00:18:29.404
I'm sorry. Don't be mad.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.432
Luna's boyfriend is so controlling.

00:18:32.532 --> 00:18:33.968
I wonder what she sees in him.

00:18:33.992 --> 00:18:35.827
Come on, don't be mad.

00:18:37.537 --> 00:18:38.538
Gotcha!

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:40.724
Kino! What are you doing?

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:41.823
Where's my lunch?

00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:43.418
My lunch.

00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:50.217
I thought you were suspended?

00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:52.219
Let's talk later.

00:18:52.552 --> 00:18:54.137
Don't be mad, please.

00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:00.310
This looks so good.

00:19:01.853 --> 00:19:02.830
Save it for later!

00:19:02.854 --> 00:19:04.494
You'll run out of food if you eat it now.

00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:08.277
Your friends?

00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:11.937
- My group mates.
- Hi, group mates.

00:19:11.962 --> 00:19:12.883
Hi.

00:19:12.907 --> 00:19:14.867
All right, you guys eat first.
I'll be over there.

00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:18.161
Bye-bye.

00:19:21.748 --> 00:19:22.874
Your boyfriend?

00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:24.894
Your boyfriend?

00:19:24.918 --> 00:19:25.894
No.

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.605
We're just childhood friends.
Best friends.

00:19:27.629 --> 00:19:28.880
Oh…

00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:32.191
Best friends, huh? Okay.

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.052
Let's talk about the art project.

00:19:48.057 --> 00:19:50.226
All right, team. Gather around, please.

00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:56.135
As you all know,

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:58.511
we have four new players this year.

00:19:58.535 --> 00:20:00.471
And as part of our tradition,

00:20:00.495 --> 00:20:03.057
we'll be doing a skills demo drill.

00:20:03.081 --> 00:20:04.058
Okay?

00:20:04.082 --> 00:20:05.834
I want you to show us what you've got.

00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:07.312
Do your best,

00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:10.064
this is your time to shine
and impress the seniors.

00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:11.113
Okay?

00:20:11.224 --> 00:20:12.225
Come on, let's go!

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.618
Why'd you throw it, bro?

00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:44.907
Girl in orange, sorry,
we didn't mean to hit you.

00:20:44.932 --> 00:20:46.142
Can you pass the ball?

00:20:51.154 --> 00:20:52.230
Thanks, you're the best!

00:20:52.255 --> 00:20:55.318
Oh my god, Camero's so handsome.

00:20:55.342 --> 00:20:57.195
He's really good-looking.

00:20:57.219 --> 00:20:59.221
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:06.228
You're all getting too distracted.

00:21:06.253 --> 00:21:07.253
Focus on the game.

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:20.717
I'll go ahead, bro.

00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:21.758
Okay, bye.

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:24.437
Finished with your training?

00:21:24.788 --> 00:21:26.828
I told you to go home first, right?

00:21:27.082 --> 00:21:29.876
I also told you we'd go home together.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:32.182
And I didn't even wait that long.

00:21:32.504 --> 00:21:33.981
We had a meeting at the music club.

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:37.426
I joined so you know I can play at events.

00:21:38.337 --> 00:21:40.113
That's good, because I thought

00:21:40.137 --> 00:21:42.323
you'd still try to force your way

00:21:42.347 --> 00:21:44.141
into the girls' volleyball team.

00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:47.120
You know, I really don't get your coach.

00:21:47.144 --> 00:21:50.581
Why won't she let me join the
girls' volleyball team?

00:21:50.605 --> 00:21:54.443
I'm tall, I'm good. I just don't get it.

00:21:56.194 --> 00:21:59.090
You don't get why you
can't get into the girls'

00:21:59.114 --> 00:22:00.451
volleyball team?

00:22:00.476 --> 00:22:02.853
Explain it to me. Why?

00:22:05.729 --> 00:22:06.521
By the way,

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:09.925
maybe you'd like to
join the music club too.

00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:13.294
Pass.

00:22:13.837 --> 00:22:14.843
Stingy.

00:22:16.256 --> 00:22:17.733
Am I sleeping over at your place tonight?

00:22:17.757 --> 00:22:18.734
Come on.

00:22:18.758 --> 00:22:19.759
Okay.

00:22:25.849 --> 00:22:27.285
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:28.560
We're here.

00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:31.247
- Hi, Via!
- Via!

00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:33.082
Hello, Ysha, Mira!

00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:33.876
Hi, Via!

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.109
- What are you guys doing?
- Hi, Arkin!

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:37.360
You guys should eat now.

00:22:37.611 --> 00:22:38.963
- Hey, Aidan!
- Hoy, Aidan!

00:22:38.987 --> 00:22:40.006
You guys are back.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.549
- Hello, Pa.
- Pa.

00:22:40.573 --> 00:22:42.115
Kino's gonna sleep here.

00:22:42.324 --> 00:22:43.300
Okay.

00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:43.844
Can I get a kiss first?

00:22:43.868 --> 00:22:45.470
You have a lot of clothes there, right?

00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:47.305
Yes, plenty in her room.

00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:48.681
Okay, change first,

00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:50.766
then I'll call you when it's time to eat.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.767
All right.

00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:52.972
Okay?

00:22:53.627 --> 00:22:55.253
That's enough.

00:22:55.545 --> 00:22:56.522
We'll go upstairs, Pa.

00:22:56.546 --> 00:22:57.923
- Okay.
- Be careful.

00:22:58.882 --> 00:22:59.883
You're getting heavy.

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:02.552
You're getting really heavy.

00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:09.778
I'm borrowing this.

00:23:17.169 --> 00:23:19.046
How's that song you're writing?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.821
Not done yet.

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:24.658
I don't even know what it's about.

00:23:25.492 --> 00:23:26.501
Why?

00:23:26.952 --> 00:23:28.537
Do you want to write a song?

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.884
Come on, sing the verse.

00:23:47.639 --> 00:23:48.640
Sing the verse.

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:50.397
Come on.

00:23:53.303 --> 00:23:55.622
Why not? Your voice is really beautiful.

00:23:55.753 --> 00:23:58.881
You'd really fit in
the music club. Please join.

00:23:59.169 --> 00:24:02.881
I'm not really into music, so I'll pass.

00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:05.945
Well,

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:09.744
at least now you're interested
in making friends with others.

00:24:10.368 --> 00:24:11.369
Friends?

00:24:11.394 --> 00:24:12.228
Yes.

00:24:12.253 --> 00:24:13.254
With who?

00:24:13.558 --> 00:24:14.476
The girls you were eating lunch with,

00:24:14.501 --> 00:24:15.835
your group mates.

00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:18.950
Luna and Kierra?

00:24:18.975 --> 00:24:21.770
They're not my friends.
They just ate with me.

00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:24.092
Then be friends with them.

00:24:24.426 --> 00:24:25.510
They seem okay.

00:24:26.553 --> 00:24:28.804
Sometimes, I worry about you.

00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:31.499
I'm fine being alone.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.869
And those girls
wouldn't want to be friends

00:24:33.893 --> 00:24:35.162
with someone like me.

00:24:35.186 --> 00:24:36.730
We're really just group mates.

00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:38.645
Why not?

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.880
Don't they know
the perks of being friends

00:24:40.905 --> 00:24:42.532
with Avianna Diaz?

00:24:42.886 --> 00:24:43.912
First...

00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:46.823
Free lunch.

00:24:47.307 --> 00:24:48.308
Second...

00:24:49.284 --> 00:24:50.577
Free lunch.

00:24:51.244 --> 00:24:51.972
Third...

00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:54.724
That's all the perks
you can think of? Really?

00:24:54.748 --> 00:24:55.849
Take a guess.

00:24:55.874 --> 00:24:56.875
Free lunch?

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:57.956
Right.

00:24:59.127 --> 00:25:00.262
Okay, fine.

00:25:00.545 --> 00:25:01.546
Let's make a deal.

00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.132
If you befriend them,

00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:07.403
I'll never ask you
to make my lunch. Ever.

00:25:07.427 --> 00:25:09.763
Forever and ever. Well?

00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:11.348
We got ourselves a deal?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.491
Come on.

00:25:12.515 --> 00:25:13.285
Really?

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:14.309
Yes.

00:25:14.426 --> 00:25:15.177
All right then.

00:25:15.202 --> 00:25:16.787
- No take-backs, okay?
- You said it.

00:25:16.812 --> 00:25:17.812
Yeah.

00:25:18.647 --> 00:25:20.583
Via, Arkin, time to eat!

00:25:20.607 --> 00:25:21.460
Food's ready.

00:25:21.484 --> 00:25:22.484
Just in time, I'm hungry.

00:25:23.068 --> 00:25:24.069
Let's go!

00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:31.469
Luna: Announcement! Groupmates!

00:25:31.493 --> 00:25:34.430
Let's do our project at
Kierra's house this Saturday,

00:25:34.454 --> 00:25:37.350
1 p.m. onwards. There'll be free snacks,

00:25:37.374 --> 00:25:40.061
the room's air-conditioned,
and the bathroom has a bidet,

00:25:40.085 --> 00:25:43.588
so make sure you
can come, okay? Okay!

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.860
Oh no. This is the first time

00:25:47.884 --> 00:25:50.237
I'll be going to a classmate's house.

00:25:50.261 --> 00:25:51.429
Kinda nerve-wracking…

00:25:54.057 --> 00:25:55.826
- Via, don't be shy.
- Via!

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.496
Put your stuff there and make
yourself at home, okay?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.129
- Thanks.
- Come here, sit here.

00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:01.606
Look.

00:26:02.273 --> 00:26:04.418
See this? I drew it.

00:26:04.442 --> 00:26:05.261
Is it good?

00:26:05.286 --> 00:26:06.287
Yes, it's really nice.

00:26:06.312 --> 00:26:07.313
So pretty.

00:26:07.737 --> 00:26:09.340
Even this one's really good.

00:26:09.364 --> 00:26:12.764
I made this. It's better than Luna's, right?

00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:14.750
Wow.

00:26:15.829 --> 00:26:18.015
They both look great,

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:22.520
but I'm not sure if I can draw that good.

00:26:22.544 --> 00:26:25.147
What? We've seen your drawings.

00:26:25.171 --> 00:26:26.482
You know, I actually think the three of us

00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:27.757
will get the highest grades.

00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:30.486
Someone's full of herself.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.636
It's true though.

00:26:31.928 --> 00:26:32.947
Come on, take your stuff out already.

00:26:32.971 --> 00:26:33.865
Girls!

00:26:33.889 --> 00:26:35.199
- Mommy!
- Hi, Auntie.

00:26:35.223 --> 00:26:36.367
I brought some snacks.

00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:37.563
Mommy, this is Via, by the way.

00:26:37.587 --> 00:26:39.839
Auntie, Via's our friend.

00:26:40.478 --> 00:26:42.605
- Hi, Via! Welcome!
- Hello.

00:26:43.314 --> 00:26:45.892
Girls, if you need me,
I'll just be downstairs, okay?

00:26:45.924 --> 00:26:47.344
- Okay, Auntie.
- I'll be downstairs.

00:26:47.368 --> 00:26:48.911
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:26:48.936 --> 00:26:49.984
Thank you so much.

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:52.550
My god, I'm so excited for the food.

00:26:52.574 --> 00:26:53.718
What? I thought...

00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:54.594
Friend?

00:26:54.618 --> 00:26:55.618
Huh?

00:26:55.678 --> 00:26:56.595
Friend?

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:59.515
Why? You don't want to be our friend?

00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:01.267
If I were Via, I wouldn't want
to be your friend either.

00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:02.476
Hey! I'm nice, okay?

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.019
- Huh?
- Via, I promise I'm really nice.

00:27:04.043 --> 00:27:05.688
You know what, I'll even give
you my chicken skin

00:27:05.712 --> 00:27:09.108
and I'll go with you anywhere, anytime.

00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:11.405
I can even help you
with your assignments.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.431
I promise.

00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:14.291
I'll do all that for you.

00:27:14.888 --> 00:27:16.532
But, why me?

00:27:16.556 --> 00:27:17.492
Why not?

00:27:17.516 --> 00:27:18.493
Yeah, why not?

00:27:18.517 --> 00:27:20.327
Well, you're our friend now.
You don't have a choice.

00:27:20.351 --> 00:27:21.352
Exactly.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.831
So here it is. Give me that.

00:27:23.855 --> 00:27:26.900
We'll always be with you, okay?
You can't be alone.

00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:28.753
Hey, let's eat.

00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:29.379
Oh, right!

00:27:29.403 --> 00:27:30.921
Try this, quick. It's really good.

00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:36.135
You know, for our project,
we should just collaborate.

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.345
Since our styles are kind of different.

00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:39.805
This girl is such a...

00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:41.182
What? I just want to shine.

00:27:41.206 --> 00:27:42.999
And I want it to be colorful and you.

00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:46.169
I should've asked Auntie for some ham.

00:27:47.378 --> 00:27:49.461
Via: Sorry, Kino, you lost the deal.

00:27:49.506 --> 00:27:50.442
I've got friends now.

00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:53.402
Via: So no more lunch for you. Haha.

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:54.803
Arkin: Waaahh!

00:27:59.557 --> 00:28:00.850
Good morning!

00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:08.858
Wow, you still packed
me lunch. Unbelievable.

00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:10.669
You're really heaven-sent, Via.

00:28:10.693 --> 00:28:12.797
You're such a kind person,
an actual angel.

00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:14.215
I'm willing to worship you.

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:15.800
Via… Via...

00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:16.824
This looks good...

00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:19.553
You're so dramatic. So annoying.

00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:23.706
I thought you were serious about
not making me lunch anymore.

00:28:23.998 --> 00:28:28.646
Why did you even make a bet
if you couldn't let go?

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.879
You probably...

00:28:30.672 --> 00:28:34.193
You probably thought I couldn't
make any friends, huh?

00:28:34.217 --> 00:28:36.278
No way! I was actually manifesting it.

00:28:36.303 --> 00:28:39.515
And I can totally live without lunch

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.292
if it means you'd make friends.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.810
- Via...
- What?

00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:46.170
I'm willing to skip lunch for you.

00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:48.582
That's why I packed you lunch,

00:28:48.606 --> 00:28:52.068
so I wouldn't feel guilty if you didn't eat.

00:28:55.613 --> 00:28:56.590
Wait a sec.

00:28:56.614 --> 00:28:58.801
Your necktie's all messy. Let me fix it.

00:28:58.825 --> 00:28:59.761
Okay.

00:28:59.785 --> 00:29:00.875
Hold on.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.056
Hey, that surprise quiz from
Sir Sabado was so hard.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.832
I think I barely passed.

00:29:06.207 --> 00:29:07.601
He gave us one, too.

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:09.377
I probably failed mine.

00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:11.480
No way, your score's high.

00:29:11.504 --> 00:29:14.024
We checked your papers,
you got nine out of ten.

00:29:14.048 --> 00:29:15.048
Really?

00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:17.051
Apparently, I'm good at guessing.

00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:20.156
All done?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180
Yeah.

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:22.640
Nice.

00:29:23.391 --> 00:29:24.535
Arkin!

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.579
Hi, Ysha! Good morning...

00:29:26.603 --> 00:29:27.663
Hey, what happened to your hair?

00:29:27.687 --> 00:29:30.440
It's messy. Come on,
let's fix it over there.

00:29:30.732 --> 00:29:32.692
How are you?
Have you eaten breakfast?

00:29:33.192 --> 00:29:34.712
Did you eat well? Did you eat a lot?

00:29:34.736 --> 00:29:35.789
- Yes.
- You ate a lot?

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.070
Yes.

00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:40.843
Arkin's always like that.
You'd think he's lazy,

00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:43.745
but the truth is, he's really smart.

00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:46.932
Sometimes I even
get jealous of him because

00:29:46.956 --> 00:29:51.020
I really have to put in effort
just to get passing grades.

00:29:51.044 --> 00:29:53.922
Arkin's actually amazing. He's special.

00:29:55.006 --> 00:29:59.719
You like playing with
makeup or dolls, right?

00:30:01.971 --> 00:30:05.558
Jeez, I am so sleepy.

00:30:09.854 --> 00:30:11.147
Chips again?

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.066
It's so early for junk food.

00:30:13.608 --> 00:30:15.151
Don't be like them.

00:30:15.568 --> 00:30:17.195
You weren't like this before.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.739
Honestly, you've gotten really fat.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.509
Haven't you seen your body
in the mirror lately?

00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:25.804
And your eating habits too,
tone it down, please.

00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:27.497
Am I really getting fat?

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:32.436
Wow, this guy's unbelievable.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.939
Controlling and a body-shamer.

00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:37.465
I really don't like Luna's boyfriend.

00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.055
Are you that Samantha who's been
spreading rumors about me?

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.611
What?

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:50.095
Don't “what” me.

00:30:50.478 --> 00:30:50.956
You're such a drama queen,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.540
and I don't plan on gossiping about it!

00:30:52.605 --> 00:30:54.166
Why are they fighting?

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.459
If you have nothing good to say,

00:30:55.483 --> 00:30:57.002
keep your mouth shut, okay?

00:30:57.026 --> 00:30:59.129
I didn't do anything wrong.
What's wrong with you?

00:30:59.153 --> 00:31:00.655
What's wrong with you!

00:31:03.411 --> 00:31:05.121
Are you okay? You all right?

00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:10.488
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:31:11.046 --> 00:31:12.923
That's Yanna.

00:31:13.418 --> 00:31:14.919
There's gossip about her

00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:18.589
making out with
someone behind the gym.

00:31:18.928 --> 00:31:20.263
It kinda seems true though.

00:31:22.343 --> 00:31:24.196
They say she's the daughter
of a former adult star.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.180
Looks like she's following
in her mom's footsteps.

00:31:28.182 --> 00:31:29.559
What's so funny about that?

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:31.122
Huh?

00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:23.780
You want some water?

00:32:26.157 --> 00:32:27.658
Have some.

00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:42.694
I'll get going...

00:33:06.781 --> 00:33:10.135
Wow, no one makes
fish balls like you, sir!

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:14.890
For real, his kikiam is the best.

00:33:14.914 --> 00:33:17.291
Sir, can I get four pieces, please?

00:33:18.376 --> 00:33:19.377
Thanks.

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:23.214
I'll have one more stick of fish balls, sir.

00:33:23.506 --> 00:33:25.299
Via! Let me have some.

00:33:25.925 --> 00:33:26.926
Come on, give me some.

00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:33.306
Kino, this is Luna and Kierra.

00:33:33.331 --> 00:33:35.333
Luna, Ke, this is Arkin, my best friend.

00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:37.462
Hi, best friend!

00:33:37.487 --> 00:33:38.572
Hello, group mates.

00:33:39.688 --> 00:33:41.857
You know, you're handsome.

00:33:41.882 --> 00:33:43.258
You look like a child star.

00:33:43.283 --> 00:33:45.452
- So cute!
- Hey!

00:33:57.481 --> 00:33:58.940
Via!

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.395
He pinched me.

00:34:01.419 --> 00:34:02.021
What's wrong with you?

00:34:02.045 --> 00:34:04.130
- Why'd you pinch Luna?
- Is it red?

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.227
I thought it's okay to get even.

00:34:07.252 --> 00:34:09.254
Luna's turning red. See, it's your fault.

00:34:09.302 --> 00:34:10.571
You keep pinching people for no reason,

00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:11.905
now you got payback.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:12.948
I'm sorry.

00:34:12.972 --> 00:34:15.576
Sorry, Luna. I'll just
buy you some fish balls.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.201
Just a piece.

00:34:16.225 --> 00:34:17.120
What do you mean, just a piece?

00:34:17.144 --> 00:34:18.912
Your friend's such a cheapskate.

00:34:18.936 --> 00:34:19.937
Buy all of this.

00:34:22.064 --> 00:34:23.733
You two are kinda cute.

00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:26.194
You're always together, like
a buy one take one deal.

00:34:28.404 --> 00:34:29.882
See? They really are cute.

00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:31.282
Bro, what's up?

00:34:31.657 --> 00:34:33.802
Fifty pesos worth of kwek-kwek, please.

00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:34.932
Sure.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.121
Who are you?

00:34:38.831 --> 00:34:40.041
And who are you?

00:34:46.921 --> 00:34:49.131
Hey, freshman,
your cheeks are turning red.

00:34:49.967 --> 00:34:54.305
Really? Is it that obvious?

00:34:57.016 --> 00:34:58.267
It's kinda cute, actually.

00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:02.039
How about this, bro? Is it obvious?

00:35:02.063 --> 00:35:03.164
Is it cute, too?

00:35:03.189 --> 00:35:04.857
You look like a tomato, man.

00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:09.487
I'm Sevi, by the way.

00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:11.131
Sevi...

00:35:11.155 --> 00:35:12.091
Sevi Camero.

00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:14.614
The one our classmate has a crush on...

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:18.309
Kierra, Luna, Via, and Via's best friend.

00:35:18.412 --> 00:35:19.997
Arkin.

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.210
Come on now, lend us fifty bucks of that.

00:35:24.627 --> 00:35:25.854
Sir, give these kids something.

00:35:25.878 --> 00:35:26.731
- You heard that?
- Wow,

00:35:26.755 --> 00:35:28.065
- He's treating us.
- Give us some extra.

00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:29.089
Sure thing!

00:35:29.799 --> 00:35:31.050
Bro, get us the expensive one.

00:35:31.801 --> 00:35:32.945
Sure, I got this.

00:35:32.969 --> 00:35:33.946
He said he's got it, Via.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.906
I don't want any!

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.890
You're not the only one
who'll be treating me now.

00:35:38.894 --> 00:35:41.521
Finally, it's the last week of school.

00:35:41.546 --> 00:35:43.373
Where are you
spending your summer, Via?

00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:44.873
Probably just at home.

00:35:44.897 --> 00:35:46.792
We still have volleyball
training at the club.

00:35:46.816 --> 00:35:48.669
What if I joined the volleyball club too?

00:35:48.693 --> 00:35:50.128
Then I'd be really good at spiking,

00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:52.113
and you can call me Ace.

00:35:52.652 --> 00:35:53.840
Let me try, come on.

00:35:53.864 --> 00:35:54.865
I'll show you, okay?

00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:55.992
Look at this.

00:35:57.326 --> 00:35:58.553
So it's like this first, right?

00:35:58.577 --> 00:36:00.472
Then like this, right?

00:36:00.496 --> 00:36:01.574
- Yeah?
- And then...

00:36:04.475 --> 00:36:05.499
Oh no, Via!

00:36:06.877 --> 00:36:07.522
Oh no!

00:36:07.546 --> 00:36:08.689
Oh my god, Via!

00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:11.942
- Hey! Hey!
- Via, I'm so sorry, Via!

00:36:11.966 --> 00:36:14.861
I told you, you really shouldn't
join the volleyball team!

00:36:14.885 --> 00:36:16.238
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

00:36:16.262 --> 00:36:17.281
- Via?
- I'm really sorry.

00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:18.723
Via, Via! Via!

00:36:18.948 --> 00:36:20.200
- What happened to you?
- No, I'm okay.

00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:21.285
You're bleeding, there's blood!

00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:22.369
Are you sure you're okay?

00:36:22.393 --> 00:36:23.412
I'm fine, really.

00:36:23.436 --> 00:36:24.163
Can you stand up?

00:36:24.187 --> 00:36:25.539
- You can't even stand!
- I'm standing.

00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:26.457
- What hurts?
- I said I'm standing.

00:36:26.481 --> 00:36:28.125
How many fingers? How many?

00:36:28.149 --> 00:36:28.876
Ten.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.794
Oh no, she's dumb now!

00:36:30.818 --> 00:36:32.421
I need to take you to the clinic.

00:36:32.445 --> 00:36:34.798
I'll hit you ten times if you don't stop!

00:36:34.822 --> 00:36:36.383
I said I'm fine!

00:36:36.407 --> 00:36:37.010
I'm fine!

00:36:37.034 --> 00:36:38.176
Via, you're not fine! You need

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.553
I'm taking you to the clinic, come on.

00:36:39.577 --> 00:36:40.513
Where's...

00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:41.537
Where's the clinic?

00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:42.638
Via, don't...

00:36:42.663 --> 00:36:43.599
Don't close your eyes, don't close them.

00:36:43.623 --> 00:36:45.267
Via, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this...

00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:46.518
You just had to try spiking, huh!

00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:47.312
I'm not playing volleyball ever again!

00:36:47.336 --> 00:36:48.536
This way could've been better.

00:36:50.788 --> 00:36:52.790
Arkin: Via I'll pick you up after my class.

00:36:52.815 --> 00:36:53.942
Arkin: Are you okay?

00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:56.882
Via: I'm fine. It didn't hit anything vital!

00:37:35.194 --> 00:37:36.862
Is she being bullied?

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:20.528
What the heck! You're in the way.

00:38:20.553 --> 00:38:22.263
I'm sorry. Are you crying?

00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:23.722
What do you care?

00:38:24.098 --> 00:38:26.197
- Attention-seeking bitch.
- Wait, aren't you...

00:38:32.898 --> 00:38:34.442
Hey, I'm Samantha.

00:38:35.576 --> 00:38:36.702
Do you know that girl?

00:38:38.154 --> 00:38:39.488
I don't know her.

00:38:41.258 --> 00:38:42.271
I see.

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.326
Thank you.

00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:01.417
Does it still hurt?

00:39:03.724 --> 00:39:05.017
It's really red.

00:39:06.493 --> 00:39:07.909
Are you even a volleyball player?

00:39:07.933 --> 00:39:11.061
You keep looking around, that's
why you got hit by the ball.

00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:13.048
You're being so dramatic.

00:39:13.289 --> 00:39:15.935
I already said I'm fine, it doesn't hurt.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.505
Guess I shouldn't have
let you sleep over tonight.

00:39:18.675 --> 00:39:19.712
Me?

00:39:19.737 --> 00:39:22.218
I'm literally here to take care
of you because you're injured.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.797
Jeez.

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:27.036
By the way,

00:39:27.995 --> 00:39:30.706
I'm joining the photojournalism
club next school year.

00:39:31.838 --> 00:39:33.674
They liked the shots I took.

00:39:36.882 --> 00:39:38.008
You're joining two clubs?

00:39:38.033 --> 00:39:39.145
Yes.

00:39:39.622 --> 00:39:42.458
Aside from music, I like cameras too.

00:39:42.992 --> 00:39:45.828
And so I can be there
during your games.

00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:49.799
Photographers usually get sent
to cover school events, right?

00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:53.288
They didn't let me join the
girls' volleyball team anyway,

00:39:53.312 --> 00:39:57.191
so I'll just take pictures of
you looking dumb for my edits.

00:39:57.756 --> 00:40:00.217
You really found another
way to annoy me, huh?

00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:05.666
And you? Maybe you wanna
join another club too.

00:40:06.198 --> 00:40:07.783
Come on, join the music club.

00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.326
So we can be together there.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.571
Can't you live without me?

00:40:13.836 --> 00:40:14.837
Nope.

00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:20.130
I don't want to join two clubs.
I'm fine with volleyball.

00:40:26.679 --> 00:40:29.890
That's a shame, they won't
get to hear your voice.

00:40:30.596 --> 00:40:31.600
Goodnight, Via.

00:40:33.634 --> 00:40:34.635
Goodnight, Kino.

00:40:53.412 --> 00:40:57.958
Hey guys, I'm running for
second-year student rep

00:40:57.983 --> 00:40:59.526
in the student council.

00:40:59.551 --> 00:41:00.469
Yeah!

00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:02.913
So you're into politics now?

00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:04.982
Of course! And like they say,

00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:08.113
you have to be active in school activities.

00:41:08.137 --> 00:41:09.031
They also said,

00:41:09.055 --> 00:41:11.157
make the most out
of your high school life.

00:41:13.183 --> 00:41:17.396
Come on, be part of
my campaign team, please?

00:41:17.646 --> 00:41:19.124
- I'm in.
- You're in?

00:41:19.148 --> 00:41:20.875
Hey, Via. You too, okay?

00:41:20.899 --> 00:41:23.378
I saw the poster you made,

00:41:23.402 --> 00:41:24.629
and I was like, it's so good!

00:41:24.653 --> 00:41:27.674
I really wish you'd make
my campaign poster too.

00:41:27.698 --> 00:41:30.993
Don't worry, there's
a little extra incentive.

00:41:31.285 --> 00:41:32.411
Come on, please?

00:41:32.554 --> 00:41:33.347
Sure, why not.

00:41:33.372 --> 00:41:34.570
Thank you!

00:41:37.142 --> 00:41:39.686
You see that good-looking
guy walking over there?

00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:41.403
That's Acel.

00:41:41.428 --> 00:41:43.222
He's running for president,

00:41:43.247 --> 00:41:44.582
and I'm under his party list.

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:48.777
The VP running with him is Sevi.

00:41:48.802 --> 00:41:50.010
Yeah, Sevi.

00:41:50.094 --> 00:41:52.513
That's a sure win. He's handsome.

00:41:53.057 --> 00:41:55.559
Yeah, but it's not just that,
his platform's really good too.

00:41:55.976 --> 00:41:58.687
Who else is running under Acel's party?

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.025
I heard it's a third-year rep,
I think… Samantha Vera?

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.419
- Samantha, huh…
- Yeah, she's running.

00:42:05.444 --> 00:42:06.654
I'm so excited, girl!

00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:08.797
It's gonna be like a beauty showdown.

00:42:08.822 --> 00:42:10.115
I'm really excited.

00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:13.118
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:42:13.952 --> 00:42:15.120
Why weren't you replying?

00:42:16.288 --> 00:42:17.623
We were doing research.

00:42:17.648 --> 00:42:18.559
Research?

00:42:18.583 --> 00:42:19.630
Yes.

00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:21.585
Looks more like you were just gossiping.

00:42:21.993 --> 00:42:23.202
What were you talking about?

00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:24.774
Well...

00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:27.508
Right, I just remembered.

00:42:28.038 --> 00:42:31.111
Yanna! Remember her, babe?

00:42:31.136 --> 00:42:32.031
Yes.

00:42:32.055 --> 00:42:33.639
The one I told you about before.

00:42:33.731 --> 00:42:37.225
She got caught again making out
with someone at the fire exit.

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:38.995
People were gossiping about her earlier,

00:42:39.019 --> 00:42:42.690
then the guy's girlfriend slapped her.

00:42:43.315 --> 00:42:44.459
- Yes.
- Poor thing.

00:42:44.483 --> 00:42:45.835
She's such a flirt, huh?

00:42:45.859 --> 00:42:47.754
Probably because she's the
daughter of an adult actress.

00:42:47.778 --> 00:42:48.778
Hey!

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.031
That's mean.

00:42:51.497 --> 00:42:53.582
Why does he hate Yanna so much?

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.098
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:42:57.122 --> 00:42:58.764
You've been glaring this whole time.

00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:00.141
Hey, Lance!

00:43:00.165 --> 00:43:01.165
What?

00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:05.146
Via! Give me my lunch. I'm starving.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.463
Lunch box.

00:43:08.048 --> 00:43:09.234
You know, - Lunch box.

00:43:09.258 --> 00:43:11.319
You should be the one carrying this.

00:43:11.343 --> 00:43:12.946
- All right, go eat.
- Thank you.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.221
Bye-bye.

00:43:20.686 --> 00:43:21.663
Bye-bye.

00:43:21.687 --> 00:43:23.355
Bye-bye!

00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:33.015
Guys, thanks for the time and
ideas you shared for our campaign.

00:43:34.257 --> 00:43:36.717
I can see I made the right
choice picking this team.

00:43:39.663 --> 00:43:42.684
Yeah, so let's give it our
best in the coming days.

00:43:42.708 --> 00:43:44.752
Yes!

00:43:47.087 --> 00:43:49.506
Your speech is
making me emotional, Pres.

00:43:50.382 --> 00:43:51.467
I really hope

00:43:52.426 --> 00:43:53.927
we win.

00:43:54.553 --> 00:43:58.265
And when that happens, Pres is
treating us to some snacks!

00:44:02.483 --> 00:44:03.651
All right. All right, then.

00:44:03.676 --> 00:44:05.260
Fine. I'll treat everyone, I promise.

00:44:05.285 --> 00:44:07.454
But for now, meeting adjourned.

00:44:07.825 --> 00:44:08.627
Thank you.

00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:10.795
Thank you, Pres.

00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:14.090
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:44:14.114 --> 00:44:14.717
Take care!

00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:16.366
Bye, everyone.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.490
Have you eaten yet?

00:44:19.563 --> 00:44:20.564
Not yet.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.173
Why? Are you treating us?

00:44:22.198 --> 00:44:23.283
What do you want to eat?

00:44:24.572 --> 00:44:26.199
Guys, I'll go ahead, okay?

00:44:27.037 --> 00:44:28.197
Samantha!

00:44:29.338 --> 00:44:30.315
Just call me Sam.

00:44:30.339 --> 00:44:32.776
Sam, come eat with us.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.736
There's a grill place outside.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.573
They've got chicken feet,
grilled intestines,

00:44:38.597 --> 00:44:40.729
and grilled blood. It's really
good. Have you tried it?

00:44:40.753 --> 00:44:42.963
Do you eat grilled blood?
Do you know what that is?

00:44:44.061 --> 00:44:45.705
What? Grilled blood?

00:44:45.729 --> 00:44:48.565
Hi, big sis. I'm Luna.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.255
I'm the candidate for
second-year representative.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.799
Yeah. I heard in the meeting earlier.

00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:57.282
You know what, just call me Sam.

00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:58.633
She's speaking English!

00:44:58.658 --> 00:45:02.454
Ke! Ke! Back me up. Let's switch!

00:45:02.479 --> 00:45:04.606
What? I'm not ready. Vice, you go!

00:45:08.252 --> 00:45:09.378
Good afternoon.

00:45:09.994 --> 00:45:11.871
How are you? I'm fine, thank you.

00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:14.823
Are you a foreigner?
Do you have dollars?

00:45:15.708 --> 00:45:17.793
I'm not a foreigner. Are you?

00:45:18.387 --> 00:45:19.805
You look so tall.

00:45:21.974 --> 00:45:24.327
Bro, she called me a foreigner.

00:45:24.351 --> 00:45:26.186
For real though,
do I look like a foreigner?

00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:27.454
No.

00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:28.647
She's just flattering you.

00:45:28.672 --> 00:45:29.881
Come on, let's go.

00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:33.944
Your boyfriend's
flirting with me, by the way.

00:45:34.611 --> 00:45:37.531
Can you please put a leash on your pet?

00:45:38.245 --> 00:45:39.329
I didn't know.

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:42.279
That's why I'm telling you.

00:45:42.703 --> 00:45:44.955
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

00:45:45.247 --> 00:45:46.790
I've done my part.

00:45:49.751 --> 00:45:50.728
Wow, fun times!

00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:52.605
The campaign hasn't even started yet,

00:45:52.629 --> 00:45:54.339
and there's drama already!

00:46:01.513 --> 00:46:02.931
Samantha Vera. Give it to them.

00:46:02.956 --> 00:46:06.877
Samantha Vera, third-year rep.
She's nice. Super nice.

00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:09.647
Bro, you've got
something on your cheek.

00:46:10.689 --> 00:46:11.833
I'm already helping him and he...

00:46:11.857 --> 00:46:13.126
Don't vote for him!

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.028
He's got a terrible attitude!

00:46:38.823 --> 00:46:40.783
- They're here.
- There they are.

00:46:41.403 --> 00:46:43.280
Class, listen to them first.

00:46:43.305 --> 00:46:44.782
Good day, everyone.

00:46:44.806 --> 00:46:46.141
I'm Acel.

00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:50.078
And I'm Sevi.

00:46:50.103 --> 00:46:52.480
Yes, and we are
the Ray of Light Partylist.

00:46:58.445 --> 00:46:59.131
Okay...

00:46:59.155 --> 00:47:01.007
If you vote for us,

00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:03.659
we'll be with you every step of the way.

00:47:03.951 --> 00:47:06.095
Guys, the Ray of Light
Partylist supports you.

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:07.119
Right, Sevi?

00:47:07.454 --> 00:47:08.457
Right!

00:47:08.872 --> 00:47:11.708
Once you vote for us,
we'll take care of you.

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:12.906
Okay?

00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.520
We are the Ray of Light Partylist.

00:47:14.544 --> 00:47:16.088
Ray of Light Partylist, let's go!

00:47:20.467 --> 00:47:22.344
- Hey!
- Guys, water.

00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:24.262
Here, Sevi.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.868
- You want some? Want some?
- Have some water.

00:47:28.892 --> 00:47:30.119
Looks like you already ate some,
that part's missing.

00:47:30.143 --> 00:47:31.080
You're being dramatic.

00:47:31.104 --> 00:47:32.080
You want some, Sevi?

00:47:32.104 --> 00:47:32.665
Yummy!

00:47:32.689 --> 00:47:34.690
- Via!
- This is my favorite.

00:47:39.236 --> 00:47:40.338
Lance: We need to talk.

00:47:40.362 --> 00:47:43.049
You know what, even the rice
Via cooks tastes good.

00:47:43.073 --> 00:47:44.658
Wow!

00:47:45.534 --> 00:47:47.411
Campaigning is so tiring.

00:47:48.328 --> 00:47:50.056
It's worth it. We're gonna win.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.415
Please vote for Sam Vera!

00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:54.721
Wait, you've been frowning
for a while now.

00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:56.068
What's wrong?

00:47:56.093 --> 00:47:57.270
- Is it because of—
- Luna!

00:47:57.295 --> 00:47:58.314
Speaking of...

00:47:58.338 --> 00:47:58.983
Speak of the devil.

00:47:59.007 --> 00:48:01.883
Luna, are you really planning
on not talking to me?

00:48:02.509 --> 00:48:04.570
Luna, that Yanna's
the one flirting with me,

00:48:04.594 --> 00:48:05.570
not the other way around.

00:48:05.595 --> 00:48:07.782
She keeps chatting and
messaging me nonstop.

00:48:07.806 --> 00:48:09.577
I've been ignoring her, okay?

00:48:09.766 --> 00:48:11.810
Come on, Luna, we've been
together for two years.

00:48:12.436 --> 00:48:14.021
You think I'd cheat on you now?

00:48:15.063 --> 00:48:17.399
Don't tell me you actually
believe her over me?

00:48:18.282 --> 00:48:23.202
Yanna said you invited her
to your house?

00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:24.326
Huh?

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.431
And you believed her?

00:48:27.561 --> 00:48:29.855
I don't even invite anyone over.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.298
Her, of all people? No way.

00:48:31.413 --> 00:48:33.925
That girl's just obsessed with me.

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:37.139
She's doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

00:48:39.237 --> 00:48:40.197
What's so funny?

00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:41.223
Nothing.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.651
- I asked you, what's so funny?
- Hey!

00:48:43.675 --> 00:48:44.111
- What's your problem?
- You jerk...

00:48:44.135 --> 00:48:45.112
She's being a bitch.

00:48:45.136 --> 00:48:46.720
- Let go of Via!
- She's such a bitch.

00:48:55.562 --> 00:48:56.563
Let go.

00:49:10.285 --> 00:49:11.286
Via

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.538
I'm really sorry. I'm so...

00:49:13.914 --> 00:49:15.683
Huh? What are you saying sorry for?

00:49:15.707 --> 00:49:16.976
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.853
I'm sorry too.

00:49:17.877 --> 00:49:19.520
I couldn't stop myself. I'm sorry.

00:49:19.544 --> 00:49:20.452
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:49:20.477 --> 00:49:22.896
Don't worry anymore.
Just forget about that jerk.

00:49:22.964 --> 00:49:24.609
By the way, Acel's calling you guys.

00:49:24.633 --> 00:49:25.693
He said he's treating us.

00:49:25.717 --> 00:49:27.737
Hallelujah! I'm starving!

00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:28.946
- Let's go.
- Come on!

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.782
- Let's go.
- Via…

00:49:30.806 --> 00:49:32.015
Hey, let's post some here.

00:49:32.432 --> 00:49:33.534
I'm really sorry, okay?

00:49:33.558 --> 00:49:34.614
It's fine, really.

00:49:38.105 --> 00:49:40.124
Okay. Guys, I brought some soft drinks.

00:49:40.148 --> 00:49:41.250
- Hey! Thanks, Pres!
- Who doesn't have any drinks?

00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:42.211
- Thanks, Pres.
- All good.

00:49:42.235 --> 00:49:43.753
- I got mine.
- You, Sam? Whose is this?

00:49:43.777 --> 00:49:45.213
Here, you want some more?

00:49:45.237 --> 00:49:47.298
No, Pres. I'll just have water later.

00:49:47.322 --> 00:49:47.925
You sure?

00:49:47.949 --> 00:49:49.050
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You're really nice, Pres.

00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:50.760
Via, here's one for you.

00:49:50.784 --> 00:49:52.035
Is this normal...

00:49:53.286 --> 00:49:54.287
Thanks, Pres.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:56.331
Of course.

00:49:57.707 --> 00:50:00.051
He's so caring toward other people.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.523
You know what, I think we
don't have utensils yet.

00:50:03.548 --> 00:50:04.215
I'll go grab some real quick.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.617
Wait. I'll help you, Pres.

00:50:06.466 --> 00:50:07.466
Let's go!

00:50:10.846 --> 00:50:12.472
- Five pairs, okay?
- Five? Okay.

00:50:15.876 --> 00:50:18.462
So even college students
come here too?

00:50:18.487 --> 00:50:19.821
Okay, done.

00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:24.442
You took so long.

00:50:24.808 --> 00:50:26.351
Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

00:50:28.697 --> 00:50:29.841
Hello.

00:50:29.865 --> 00:50:31.241
Hey.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.707
Don't give Sevi since he's
going to use his hands to eat.

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.941
Do they know each other?

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.134
Oh, okay!

00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:38.224
Guys!

00:50:38.248 --> 00:50:39.433
Sorry I took a while.

00:50:39.457 --> 00:50:40.857
- This is yours, Arkin.
- It's okay.

00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:42.061
Here.

00:50:42.085 --> 00:50:43.021
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you.

00:50:43.045 --> 00:50:44.129
Here's more.

00:50:45.147 --> 00:50:47.023
- Need help?
- Hold on, Via first.

00:50:47.048 --> 00:50:48.117
Okay.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.153
That's three pieces. Different flavors.

00:50:51.178 --> 00:50:53.406
- Finish them all!
- That's a lot,

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.307
I can't finish them.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.953
Why? You only ate
a little at lunch, didn't you?

00:50:58.977 --> 00:51:00.121
Make sure to eat properly.

00:51:00.145 --> 00:51:01.956
And you, on the other hand,
only drink soft drinks.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.106
Drink some water.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.501
Are you guys always like that?

00:51:04.525 --> 00:51:05.901
Like a married couple, bro.

00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:12.925
- We're just friends.
- What's your relationship?

00:51:12.949 --> 00:51:13.718
Friends?

00:51:13.742 --> 00:51:14.742
Childhood.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:26.171
Luna.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.344
Luna, are you okay?

00:51:33.803 --> 00:51:36.115
Look, I don't mean to pry,

00:51:36.139 --> 00:51:37.933
but you should just leave him.

00:51:39.184 --> 00:51:41.519
You should take care of yourself, Luna.

00:51:42.145 --> 00:51:46.959
Yeah. Honestly, I've never felt
good about that guy.

00:51:46.983 --> 00:51:48.783
I've had a bad feeling
about him since before.

00:51:57.786 --> 00:51:58.995
Excuse me.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.373
Let's eat somewhere else.

00:52:01.831 --> 00:52:02.643
Let's go.

00:52:02.667 --> 00:52:04.918
KJ, I'm really craving
for chicken, you know?

00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:08.439
Come on, we're blocking the way.

00:52:08.463 --> 00:52:10.399
That's enough, let's go.

00:52:10.423 --> 00:52:11.026
Luna.

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.318
What happened? Why are you crying?

00:52:12.342 --> 00:52:13.969
Is it because of your boyfriend?

00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:16.447
Forget him, I already know he's ugly

00:52:16.471 --> 00:52:17.806
even if I haven't met him.

00:52:18.848 --> 00:52:20.409
Luna, don't cry, okay?

00:52:20.433 --> 00:52:22.411
Don't cry over that bastard.

00:52:22.435 --> 00:52:23.559
He's ugly.

00:52:25.981 --> 00:52:29.192
What happened? Is it about
that Lance guy again?

00:52:32.654 --> 00:52:33.655
That jerk.

00:52:34.072 --> 00:52:39.035
So don't ever crush
on guys like that, okay?

00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:41.830
I would never.

00:52:51.298 --> 00:52:53.776
We're blocking the way, come on.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.137
That's enough. Just let him go.

00:53:00.056 --> 00:53:02.576
This whole week has been exhausting.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.060
I agree.

00:53:05.562 --> 00:53:08.565
I just hope they finish
tallying the votes soon.

00:53:08.857 --> 00:53:11.818
I really want to know if my bets won.

00:53:12.152 --> 00:53:16.072
But I've got a strong feeling
Luna's party is going to win.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.577
Hey, are you okay?

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.080
I think I'm going to break up with him.

00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:26.499
Really? You're actually doing it?

00:53:27.776 --> 00:53:32.864
Yeah, I feel like it's a good
thing I saw everything that happened.

00:53:33.214 --> 00:53:34.841
I saw how toxic he really is.

00:53:36.669 --> 00:53:39.339
Finally, Luna's come to her senses.

00:53:39.804 --> 00:53:41.276
Hey! What the hell?

00:53:41.308 --> 00:53:43.769
Take back everything you
said about my girlfriend.

00:53:43.794 --> 00:53:45.879
Because of you, we're not
even talking anymore.

00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:49.205
Why should I? I only told her the truth.

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.710
You're the one who should stop
spamming me with texts.

00:53:52.734 --> 00:53:56.714
Your flirting is getting annoying,
I'm not even into you.

00:53:56.738 --> 00:54:00.092
Wow, out of all the people
you've fooled around with,

00:54:00.116 --> 00:54:01.409
I'm the one you don't like?

00:54:02.327 --> 00:54:04.454
Quit pretending.

00:54:05.205 --> 00:54:08.291
For all I know,
you want a taste of me, too.

00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:10.752
You've got some nerve!

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.629
I haven't even kissed anyone yet!

00:54:12.921 --> 00:54:14.641
Here, let me give you your first kiss then.

00:54:15.423 --> 00:54:16.734
- You're disgusting!
- Luna!

00:54:16.758 --> 00:54:18.069
- So disgusting!
- Hey, Luna!

00:54:18.093 --> 00:54:19.904
- What the heck?
- You're disgusting!

00:54:19.928 --> 00:54:20.905
- Luna!
- You're disgusting!

00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:22.972
- Luna, that's enough!
- You're disgusting!

00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:27.853
Yanna!

00:54:29.354 --> 00:54:30.247
Out of the way!

00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.271
Stop!

00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:32.500
- What the—
- Move! Luna…

00:54:32.524 --> 00:54:34.835
- Babe! She's the one—
- Hey, don't you listen?

00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:36.504
Didn't I tell you to leave Luna alone?

00:54:36.528 --> 00:54:38.446
You perverted trash, that's what you are!

00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:39.925
Bitch...

00:54:39.949 --> 00:54:41.425
What did you say? Trash?

00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:43.177
- Yeah, I said you're trash.
- Huh?

00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:44.201
Trash, huh?

00:54:44.577 --> 00:54:45.389
I'm trash?

00:54:45.413 --> 00:54:46.460
Yes!

00:54:46.579 --> 00:54:47.872
You fucking bitch!

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.977
♪ You're mine… ♪

00:55:59.335 --> 00:56:01.298
I felt Arkin kick.

00:56:01.323 --> 00:56:03.617
Me too, Via kicked.

00:56:04.312 --> 00:56:05.855
You two.

00:56:07.289 --> 00:56:09.471
I think they liked our music.

00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:10.872
I think so, too.

00:56:11.831 --> 00:56:12.850
I'm getting kinda hungry.

00:56:12.874 --> 00:56:14.602
Same here, and I really need to pee.

00:56:14.626 --> 00:56:16.103
Let's rest for a bit. Break time, guys.

00:56:16.127 --> 00:56:17.200
Yeah, break time.

00:56:18.046 --> 00:56:20.608
Why do you keep following me around?

00:56:20.632 --> 00:56:23.801
Because we're best friends.

00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:29.283
We should always stay together.

00:56:29.307 --> 00:56:30.284
Why?

00:56:30.308 --> 00:56:33.353
Because you're my first friend.

00:56:50.036 --> 00:56:51.829
Guys, I have good news!

00:56:52.205 --> 00:56:54.457
We just signed a new contract!

00:56:57.085 --> 00:56:59.170
- Thank you so much!
- Guys!

00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:02.024
All right, snacks on me, guys!
Let's celebrate!

00:57:02.048 --> 00:57:04.133
You came just in time. Cheers!

00:57:41.879 --> 00:57:43.464
You waited for me again?

00:57:44.132 --> 00:57:45.150
Didn't I tell you?

00:57:45.174 --> 00:57:48.386
We go to school together
and leave together.

00:57:50.644 --> 00:57:51.854
You don't have a choice.

00:57:52.223 --> 00:57:53.224
You're so clingy.

00:57:53.249 --> 00:57:54.542
Super clingy.

00:57:55.143 --> 00:57:57.312
How was training? You tired?

00:57:57.787 --> 00:57:58.683
Yeah.

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.539
Yeah?

00:57:59.564 --> 00:58:00.564
I'm tired.

00:58:00.857 --> 00:58:01.944
You're tired?

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.401
Okay then.

00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:05.528
Come, hop on.

00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:08.172
- What?
- Get on.

00:58:08.197 --> 00:58:10.175
- No way.
- Hurry up.

00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:11.385
I said no way.

00:58:11.409 --> 00:58:12.428
I'll lie down right here if you don't get on.

00:58:12.452 --> 00:58:13.945
No! Don't - I'm really gonna lie down.

00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:15.084
I said no. Stop!

00:58:15.344 --> 00:58:16.765
Get up. I don't wanna.

00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:18.374
- Come on.
- No.

00:58:18.399 --> 00:58:19.525
Whatever.

00:58:20.376 --> 00:58:21.377
Get up.

00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:22.712
Stand up.

00:58:23.986 --> 00:58:24.986
Still tired?

00:58:25.145 --> 00:58:26.786
- Am I heavy?
- No.

00:58:26.811 --> 00:58:28.753
- Am I heavy?
- I can carry two of you.

00:59:05.296 --> 00:59:08.111
Why did you have to fight, Kino?

00:59:08.136 --> 00:59:09.777
You want me to just stand
there while that jerk

00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:10.927
had you by the collar?

00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:13.346
Does it still hurt?

00:59:18.506 --> 00:59:22.510
We only have three weeks left
before Foundation Day, guys.

00:59:23.073 --> 00:59:23.917
Hey, Yanna!

00:59:23.941 --> 00:59:26.570
You're joining the Miss Valerian pageant.

00:59:26.595 --> 00:59:28.515
You don't have a choice anymore,
I signed you up.

00:59:28.945 --> 00:59:30.154
Go ahead.

00:59:30.947 --> 00:59:33.533
I knew I'd find you here.

00:59:41.082 --> 00:59:42.291
There.

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:43.727
See?

00:59:43.751 --> 00:59:44.937
Why do you look so red?

00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:45.896
Let me see.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.690
- Huh?
- Do you have a fever?

00:59:46.714 --> 00:59:48.047
You feel warm.

00:59:49.006 --> 00:59:51.026
It's kinda hot in this room.

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.528
- Huh?
- I think the fan's...

00:59:52.552 --> 00:59:54.153
No, the aircon's on.

00:59:54.178 --> 00:59:55.179
Hi, Arkin.

00:59:58.599 --> 01:00:00.685
Kino, do you have a crush?
