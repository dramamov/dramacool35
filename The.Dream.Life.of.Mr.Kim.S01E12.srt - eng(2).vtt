THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:49.863
Mr. Kim.

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:55.077
Wait.

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:57.788
What are you doing here, sir?

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:01.333
Gosh.

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:04.169
What an unbelievable coincidence.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.338
He came here on purpose.

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.757
So, you're washing cars.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.551
I honestly had no idea you were here.

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:16.139
I don't know how he found out,
but he definitely knew.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:19.559
-It's been a while.
-It really has.

00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:22.521
Well, this is pretty awkward.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.023
I can't ask you to wash my car.

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:27.484
Maybe I should just go
to a machine wash nearby.

00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:33.657
No, on second thought,
I think that would be even ruder.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.117
How much longer on that one?

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:38.829
I just have to dry it and wax it.

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:41.915
Then I'll wait.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.842
HAND CAR WASH

00:01:58.014 --> 00:01:59.474
Take your time, sir.

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:00.934
Since I'm here anyway,

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:03.937
I'd be honored to have you wash my car.

00:02:05.313 --> 00:02:06.231
Why?

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.484
The thing is…

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:12.404
I could really use
some good luck right now.

00:02:19.578 --> 00:02:21.079
It's in two weeks.

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.499
The executive promotion announcement.

00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:33.258
Jeez.

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.310
Nak-su, your reservation's here.

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.269
What?

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:46.104
Your reservation's here.

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:48.774
Okay.

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.568
Right, I did have a reservation.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.905
It totally slipped my mind.
I have a reservation.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.492
I have to do that one
after I finish this.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:01.411
Is that right?

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:05.957
Well…

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:08.376
It is what it is.

00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:10.712
See you next time.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:14.341
I'll come back soon with good news.

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:19.137
Bye.

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:20.138
Yes, sir.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.024
-Yeong-gil!
-Yes?

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:33.193
-Change the engine oil on this one.
-Okay.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.737
Why would you lie like that?

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.864
Come on, you played along.

00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:40.283
Was that a former colleague from ACT?

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.537
Yes.

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.748
I might not be here next time.

00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:09.062
-It came out great.
-I'm getting a little emotional.

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.815
If you order over a thousand,
I can do 10,000 won each.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:14.609
Another 1,200 this time?

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.153
Just 100 for now, please.

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.410
One, two, three.

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:28.081
My family's on a tight budget these days.

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:29.541
My mom's constantly rushing around,

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:32.085
and my dad's busy
trying to clean things up.

00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:35.380
-Jeez.
-Try a different pose.

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:43.013
That's why we have
to get real results, Han-na.

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:45.557
Whether it's promotions or marketing,
we have to do it right.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.892
-Hey.
-We have to--

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:49.769
If the model looks like he's carrying
the weight of the world,

00:04:49.853 --> 00:04:51.605
who's going to buy the clothes?

00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:54.733
It says "Love Lives Here," remember?

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:59.988
-Sorry.
-If you really want to help your family,

00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:01.448
do your job right.

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:03.742
Act like a professional.

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:11.166
One more time.

00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:13.543
Let's take one as a couple.

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:24.054
One, two…

00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:33.229
One, two, three.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.287
Jeez.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:22.988
I'm home.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.033
The average selling price
of Seoul apartments

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:29.494
has risen by 0.6% compared to last month.

00:06:29.577 --> 00:06:32.288
Gangdong-gu, in particular,
surpassed the three Gangnam districts

00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:35.375
and recorded the highest rate
of increase within Seoul.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.210
For a while, Gangdong-gu
had been undervalued,

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:39.879
but with the launch of a large-scale
redevelopment project,

00:06:39.963 --> 00:06:42.298
the market sentiment has rebounded.

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:45.385
-The weather forecast…
-Also, Mapo-gu and Nowon-gu--

00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:46.428
Here it is.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.263
From late fall…

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:52.017
Have you found a place
to open your own office yet?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.102
People across the city stepped out…

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:58.189
A real estate agent I know
asked if I wanted

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:00.358
to take over her office.

00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:01.651
That's great.

00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:03.653
How much is the rental premium?

00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:07.949
Fifty million.

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:09.909
Really?

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:12.245
This is unusual for early winter.

00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:14.831
Heavy showers accompanied
by thunder and gusty winds

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.875
are expected across the country,

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.002
so be sure to bring an umbrella
when you go out.

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:20.545
Honey.

00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:23.631
-What if no one goes to the car wash?
-The rain will continue…

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:24.591
Well…

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:26.259
…making it hard to catch
a clear sky…

00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:27.969
Are you going to watch the ball game?

00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:30.138
-What channel was it?
-There's no game today.

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:31.306
You're right.

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:38.938
EPISODE 12
RAIN SHOWER

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.775
CAR WASH OWNERS' FORUM

00:07:46.613 --> 00:07:49.657
ACT HQ CORPORATE VEHICLES
CAR WASH SERVICE VENDOR RECRUITMENT

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:50.825
CAR WASH VENDOR RECRUITMENT

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:55.997
"6.2 million."

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:57.582
CONTRACT AMOUNT: 6.2 MILLION WON/MONTH

00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.751
Wow, they're paying well.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:01.544
Jeez.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.464
Well, look who's smiling.

00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:06.049
Yes.

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:09.177
Did you finally snap
from not working for a few days?

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:11.554
What are you looking at?

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.682
"ACT Headquarters Corporate Vehicles"?

00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:16.309
It's for washing the executives' cars.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:17.977
You can't do that.

00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:20.647
The competition
for those things is insane.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.565
Just look at the number of views.

00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:25.068
VIEWS: 3,453

00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:27.779
Plus, it's a major corporation.
They'll be really picky.

00:08:27.862 --> 00:08:29.364
You're not some master detailer.

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.825
You've only done small jobs
in the neighborhood.

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:32.784
A TON WILL APPLY

00:08:32.867 --> 00:08:34.369
I won't do it.

00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:38.623
If you can't, you can't.
Why say you "won't"?

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.129
No, it says here.
It requires two or more full-time staff.

00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:47.507
I see.

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.092
So you won't do it.

00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:50.969
Right.

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:52.846
You got so flustered
when that colleague came.

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:56.224
You wouldn't be able to get anything done
in a parking lot full of people you know.

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:57.350
You shouldn't apply.

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:01.354
I'm not worried about you.

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:03.815
Our brilliant Mr. Kim
will figure something out.

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:25.962
Honey.

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:26.921
Yes?

00:09:28.506 --> 00:09:31.968
Why don't you look into
opening your own automatic car wash?

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:36.264
-Why?
-It seems like everyone's going that way.

00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:38.349
Maybe because the economy's bad.

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:42.353
The car wash is doing fine.

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:46.524
It is?

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.069
Well, you know…

00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.282
Oh, right.

00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:58.453
Ta-da.

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:00.872
Su-gyeom's rent for this month.

00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:02.957
Wow, it's thick.

00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:07.503
Looks like his business is doing well.

00:10:08.713 --> 00:10:10.924
Don't you rather have your son as a tenant

00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:12.717
instead of the toast shop owner?

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:16.846
-Honey.
-Yes?

00:10:20.475 --> 00:10:23.645
So, ACT…

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:28.441
is looking for a company
to wash their corporate vehicles.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:29.734
At ACT?

00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:31.361
Yes.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.657
What should I do?
The terms are pretty good.

00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.577
It feels wrong, doesn't it?

00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:43.706
Or am I wrong? Should I do it?

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.752
It's not about what you "should" do.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:50.588
If something about it bothers you,
then you don't do it.

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:54.342
Whether it's an automatic car wash or ACT,

00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:56.803
just do whatever makes you comfortable.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:59.347
If Kim Nak-su does something,
he has his reasons.

00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:02.725
And if he doesn't,
I know he has his reasons for that too.

00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:24.622
CAR WASH VENDOR RECRUITMENT

00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:42.557
You're going to wash cars?

00:11:44.684 --> 00:11:46.436
Serves you right.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:49.022
All that talk about becoming an executive.

00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:52.025
I was 50 and you made me beg you twice.

00:11:52.108 --> 00:11:54.694
I got fired from Taejeong
because you took the Kukkiwon project.

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:55.987
Did you know that?

00:11:57.864 --> 00:11:59.198
I'm sorry.

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:02.785
-Tae-hwan.
-Yes.

00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:04.162
What are you doing?

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:05.246
Hello.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.832
We're done talking. He's about to leave.

00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:10.501
Go on inside.

00:12:11.294 --> 00:12:12.670
-I'm going back in.
-Hold on.

00:12:14.297 --> 00:12:16.966
Hand-washing cars is hard on the body

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.344
but easy on the mind.

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:21.471
Think about it seriously.

00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:27.685
Could you really bring yourself
to wash cars at ACT?

00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:32.357
In front of Sung-gu and Song-hee?

00:12:39.447 --> 00:12:40.615
A few days ago,

00:12:42.158 --> 00:12:43.993
Do Jin-woo came to the car wash.

00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:46.788
I couldn't wash his car.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.457
I lied to send him away.

00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:54.295
I felt so pathetic.

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.924
So you deliberately want to go to ACT

00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:00.927
to try and overcome
that pathetic pride of yours. Is that it?

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.470
I want to understand.

00:13:03.388 --> 00:13:05.473
What the company I worked at for 25 years

00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:09.310
truly means to me in my life.

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:16.776
Jeez.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.075
All right. Good thing you came to me.

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.744
You're lucky to have a friend like me.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.371
What is it?

00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:31.541
This commercial building is part
of the third new city development.

00:13:31.624 --> 00:13:32.959
The subway's going in on the left,

00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:34.919
and the second and third floors
are sold out.

00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:36.337
-You--
-Just listen.

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:37.505
The foot traffic's huge,

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:40.216
and a big franchise cafe
is moving in on the second floor.

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:42.844
I bargained it down to 1.1 billion won.

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:47.056
You haven't spent your severance, right?
We could each put in 550 million--

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.641
You dumbass!

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:50.518
-Come on. Get over here.
-Why?

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:51.727
Follow me, you punk.

00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:54.272
-I'm coming.
-Seriously, this guy!

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.523
Where are you going?

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:57.984
-I haven't told anyone else about this.
-We'll be right back!

00:13:58.067 --> 00:13:59.610
-Get over here.
-What is it?

00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:01.571
MANGJIN PLAZA
URGENT SALE, FOR LEASE

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:03.448
Here it is.

00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:05.825
My 500 million severance

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:07.702
and a 550 million won loan.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.415
LEASE INQUIRIES

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:17.837
But you managed to find a tenant.

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:20.339
A tenant?

00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:22.175
Hi, Dad!

00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:27.305
I couldn't find one,
so Su-gyeom is using it.

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:31.058
Snap out of it. Let's go practice.

00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:33.144
Washing cars.

00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:36.189
Keep it up.

00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:39.567
Let's go.

00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:41.319
Get a grip.

00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:49.368
ACT HQ CORPORATE VEHICLES
CAR WASH VENDOR INTERVIEWS

00:14:56.209 --> 00:14:57.835
A lot of young people showed up.

00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.420
Don't chicken out.

00:14:59.504 --> 00:15:00.963
Tough odds for us old-timers.

00:15:01.047 --> 00:15:02.632
It's fine.

00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:05.426
INTERVIEW ROOM

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.303
-Refreshing Car Wash.
-Yes.

00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:08.679
Come on in.

00:15:09.222 --> 00:15:11.224
Remember, passion and spirit.

00:15:11.307 --> 00:15:12.225
Okay?

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:13.935
Let's get in there.

00:15:14.018 --> 00:15:15.478
Take a seat.

00:15:20.274 --> 00:15:21.317
Two, three.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.319
-Hello, we're--
-Hello, we're--

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:24.820
Yes, please have a seat.

00:15:26.864 --> 00:15:27.865
Yes.

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:29.116
NAME: KIM NAK-SU

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.118
In line with ACT's management philosophy…

00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:32.078
NAME: HEO TAE-HWAN

00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:34.455
…by using eco-friendly detergents…

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:37.708
we consider the environment, and…

00:15:38.668 --> 00:15:41.087
by providing a car wash history service,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.006
we offer ACT employees a refreshing…

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.966
GENERAL MANAGER

00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:47.385
…a refreshing car wash experience

00:15:48.094 --> 00:15:49.679
which truly sets us apart…

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:52.265
I mean, that truly sets us apart.
Thank you.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:56.269
You were a general manager here?

00:15:56.352 --> 00:15:57.520
Yes.

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.897
-And you were a manager.
-Yes.

00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:01.691
-Surprised?
-No.

00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:03.317
Well,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.945
we get applicants like you often,

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:07.989
but in the end, they don't last.

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:10.866
I last… I lasted 25 years.

00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:16.122
Anyway, I'll see you later.

00:16:16.747 --> 00:16:17.623
Yes.

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:36.934
Please come this way.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.145
Please stand behind this line.

00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:41.522
Form two lines, please.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.399
Refreshing Car Wash.

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:44.358
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:16:44.442 --> 00:16:45.943
You can take this car.

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:50.031
-Crystal Wash.
-Refreshing Car Wash.

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:52.116
-You can do this car.
-Easy Car Clean.

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:53.993
-Yes.
-You can take that car.

00:16:55.244 --> 00:16:57.747
The rest of you, please wait here for now.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.374
Starting now, you have ten minutes
to wash this car.

00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:01.584
Please keep the product

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:02.793
-from splashing around.
-Okay.

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:04.462
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:06.589
Okay, begin!

00:17:09.884 --> 00:17:12.553
Try your best not to
splash the cleaning products.

00:17:33.616 --> 00:17:34.950
Here.

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:03.229
The problem with this car

00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:04.980
is that the sensors
are just too sensitive.

00:18:05.064 --> 00:18:06.148
You know your cars.

00:18:07.108 --> 00:18:09.527
I used to drive this
when I was an assistant manager.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.030
That gray sedan over there?
I've driven it more than my own car.

00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:16.450
But have you driven an executive's car?

00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:19.662
"2809." That's my boss's car.

00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:24.041
He may not care about other things,
but he can't stand dirty wheels.

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:27.169
Since we have
a full understanding of these things,

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.464
we're able to offer
this kind of special service.

00:18:30.548 --> 00:18:31.841
Hey, we're behind! Let's hurry!

00:18:31.924 --> 00:18:33.384
Please shave 30 seconds off!

00:18:58.492 --> 00:18:59.869
WAITING AREA

00:19:00.578 --> 00:19:03.706
The corporate car wash vendor
for the second half of this year…

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:08.377
is Refreshing Car Wash.

00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:16.177
Thank you so much.

00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:21.348
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:22.349
WIND QUICK DELIVERY

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:23.559
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:29.690
-We sold almost all our inventory.
-Yes!

00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:37.531
So what should our next item be?

00:19:39.325 --> 00:19:40.910
Look at you, CEO Kim Su-gyeom.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.746
Now that's how a successful CEO sits.

00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:48.667
No. I'll remain humble.

00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.711
Come on. Go even further.

00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:52.630
Put your feet up on the desk
and everything.

00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:56.425
All right, then. Maybe just a little…

00:20:01.347 --> 00:20:02.598
One second.

00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:03.599
Okay.

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:23.577
That call earlier was from your dad.

00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:24.870
Yes.

00:20:24.954 --> 00:20:27.581
So you're packing up
and flying to the US right now?

00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:30.626
Yes, as soon as I sort things out.

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:33.128
Did your dad say to come right away?

00:20:33.212 --> 00:20:34.922
Yes, he was really mad.

00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:37.508
And I think he's not feeling well.

00:20:38.926 --> 00:20:40.511
I'll sort things out and be back soon.

00:20:40.594 --> 00:20:43.389
Hold down the fort, all right?

00:20:46.642 --> 00:20:47.852
The bus is here.

00:20:49.311 --> 00:20:50.229
Bye.

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:51.897
Han-na.

00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:53.399
Yes?

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:56.277
What should I do?

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.029
What?

00:20:59.113 --> 00:21:00.573
Without you here.

00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:03.784
What am I supposed to do?

00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:07.746
Hey, how should I know?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.835
You'll figure it out somehow.

00:21:14.545 --> 00:21:15.671
I'm going.

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:18.674
Excuse me.

00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:37.860
What's this?

00:21:37.943 --> 00:21:40.070
Are you trying to steal my job?

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:43.657
I got the job.

00:21:44.408 --> 00:21:46.118
I start next week.

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:48.537
That's great.

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:55.377
REFRESHING CAR WASH

00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:59.340
Take all the car washing supplies

00:21:59.423 --> 00:22:00.758
in the trunk of this car.

00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:02.968
What?

00:22:04.345 --> 00:22:05.596
A gift for your new job.

00:22:06.096 --> 00:22:08.223
When you got your first job 25 years ago,

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:09.975
I couldn't afford it.

00:22:10.726 --> 00:22:12.061
Let's just call it even with this.

00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:13.604
ON-SITE AND CORPORATE CAR WASH

00:22:15.648 --> 00:22:16.815
You knew I'd get the job?

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:20.277
You're our family's
greatest success story.

00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:21.654
Of course you would land the job.

00:22:21.737 --> 00:22:25.199
If you'd gotten tutoring instead of me,
you would've gotten into SNU.

00:22:26.367 --> 00:22:28.118
What's the point of saying that now?

00:22:29.954 --> 00:22:31.163
Don't come back now.

00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:36.669
Wash cars in the big city.

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:40.172
Don't be like me, stuck on the outskirts.

00:22:42.257 --> 00:22:44.176
Hey, don't say that!

00:22:44.927 --> 00:22:46.220
You're great.

00:22:57.314 --> 00:22:59.149
OPEN YEAR-ROUND
REFRESHING CAR WASH

00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:03.153
I think we're almost done.

00:23:03.904 --> 00:23:04.905
Okay.

00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:07.658
-Congratulations on the job!
-Congratulations!

00:23:10.285 --> 00:23:12.121
You really didn't have to get a cake.

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:14.999
Come on. It's like you won
the World's Best Car Wash Competition.

00:23:15.082 --> 00:23:17.084
-Put it here.
-Congratulations again, sir.

00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:19.878
All those late nights you worked
finally paid off.

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:21.046
Oh, come on.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.549
Say "thank you" already.

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:25.384
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you.

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:27.052
Should we blow out the candles together?

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:28.762
-Sure.
-One, two, three!

00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:32.016
Congratulations!

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:33.559
Congrats! You pulled it off!

00:23:33.642 --> 00:23:37.062
-Make sure you do a good job.
-I just need to do what I'm told.

00:23:37.146 --> 00:23:39.356
-But you are good at it.
-Let's go eat. My treat.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.233
-What?
-Let's grill some meat today.

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:44.153
-Stone-grilled barbecue!
-Stone-grilled barbecue!

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:47.156
The jjajang there is really good.
It's a great place.

00:23:47.239 --> 00:23:49.533
-Hey, you have to take the cake!
-Right.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:51.660
Here, be careful.

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.370
So, about this--

00:23:53.912 --> 00:23:54.955
-Honey.
-Yes?

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:57.708
If you run into someone you know,
just smile, okay?

00:23:58.584 --> 00:24:00.544
Just say hello to them first.

00:24:00.627 --> 00:24:02.671
It's more embarrassing
to try and hide. Got it?

00:24:02.755 --> 00:24:04.256
You're worrying for nothing again.

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:07.217
If I cared about things like that,
I wouldn't have applied.

00:24:07.301 --> 00:24:08.177
Okay.

00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:18.187
REFRESHING CAR WASH

00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:22.399
What's with the mask?

00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:24.401
Let's take the stuff out.

00:24:26.028 --> 00:24:27.321
For crying out loud.

00:24:27.404 --> 00:24:29.907
After talking so big
in front of your wife…

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.284
-It's for the dust.
-Whatever.

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:33.994
Hey, Ik-hyeon's here.

00:24:35.662 --> 00:24:36.872
Never try acting.

00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:40.501
Mr. Kim.

00:24:51.804 --> 00:24:53.222
Let me do it.

00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:54.807
Ik-hyeon, it's okay.

00:24:55.307 --> 00:24:56.642
I don't mind.

00:24:59.103 --> 00:24:59.978
Ik-hyeon.

00:25:00.062 --> 00:25:01.647
Don't worry, sir.

00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:03.649
It's not that I'm worried.

00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.360
Everyone will find out eventually…

00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:07.778
TODAY'S SCHEDULE: 35 CARS

00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:09.613
…that we're doing this.

00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:11.281
So no need to tell them in advance--

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.495
Mr. Kim.

00:25:16.578 --> 00:25:19.123
I'll keep it a secret. I will.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.417
I know it's not my place,
but if I could just say one thing.

00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:23.710
Go ahead.

00:25:23.794 --> 00:25:25.921
It makes me nervous
when you get all serious like that.

00:25:26.004 --> 00:25:27.256
What is it?

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.092
I respect you.

00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:32.511
I truly do.

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:44.022
He probably really meant that.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.276
He has nothing to gain
by flattering you now, right?

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.112
How about a nice iced Americano?

00:25:52.781 --> 00:25:53.824
Sounds good.

00:25:59.788 --> 00:26:02.040
This is going so much faster
with the two of us.

00:26:02.124 --> 00:26:03.667
The cars are mostly clean.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.752
I don't think this will be
too hard at all.

00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:07.713
That's why it was so competitive.

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:08.755
This is totally doable.

00:26:09.715 --> 00:26:11.550
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:14.136
There was one thing
I forgot to mention earlier.

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:15.971
The other vehicles are fine,

00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:18.473
but the executive vehicles
require some special care.

00:26:18.557 --> 00:26:19.641
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:26:19.725 --> 00:26:21.727
These are the handover instructions.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.522
Just take a look at this
and follow it exactly as written.

00:26:25.606 --> 00:26:26.481
All right.

00:26:26.565 --> 00:26:28.734
Read it carefully.
Don't skip anything. Take care.

00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:29.776
Just a moment.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.030
Do we have to use these exact brands?

00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:34.823
That's why I gave it to you.

00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:37.743
So what about the cost
of these products?

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:39.995
That's included in the service fee.

00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:42.789
You should read the contract properly.

00:26:42.873 --> 00:26:46.043
And why do we clean the golf clubs?

00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:53.467
We understand. All right.

00:26:54.051 --> 00:26:55.719
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.140
And have your drinks or snacks
over there in the corner, out of sight.

00:27:00.224 --> 00:27:01.433
Right.

00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:06.271
-Take care.
-Yes.

00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:07.981
-Yes.
-Understood.

00:27:09.107 --> 00:27:11.735
"Sensitive to tire pressure."
What the hell?

00:27:11.818 --> 00:27:13.403
-Who gives a damn?
-Hey.

00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:16.406
Let's just do it. Come on.

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:21.703
Didn't you use to go out
on the course with Mr. Hwang sometimes?

00:27:22.329 --> 00:27:23.372
Oh man.

00:27:23.455 --> 00:27:25.958
And now you're cleaning
the man's golf clubs.

00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.084
What a life.

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:31.296
The air pressure is fine.
What more do they want from us?

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.881
Do they want us to add more?

00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:35.175
-Keep it down.
-Excuse me, you two.

00:27:36.468 --> 00:27:37.761
Come with me for a moment.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.848
About Managing Director Cho Gi-jung.

00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:45.018
The only joy he gets on his commute
is watching the Hangang River.

00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:48.772
Today, those fingerprints on the glass

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:51.149
totally threw him off.

00:27:51.733 --> 00:27:52.609
We're sorry.

00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:55.904
Put yourself in his shoes.

00:27:55.988 --> 00:27:58.323
In a way, his precious daily routine
was disrupted.

00:27:58.407 --> 00:27:59.741
Wouldn't you be angry?

00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:10.294
See? It's your hand.

00:28:10.377 --> 00:28:12.087
Those stubby fingers.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.256
And you've got piano hands?

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:15.799
Your fingers look exactly the same.

00:28:15.882 --> 00:28:17.009
Pass me the towel.

00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:21.471
-What in the world…
-You should've been more careful.

00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:23.849
I don't think this was us.

00:28:23.932 --> 00:28:26.226
It's definitely your hand.
Be careful from now on.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.353
I don't think it's ours.
Someone else must have--

00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:30.397
You were leaning here
and drinking coffee.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.440
I saw you.

00:28:32.482 --> 00:28:34.359
My, they're working so hard.

00:28:36.862 --> 00:28:38.780
This is delicious.

00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:43.785
-What are we doing, hiding here?
-Just eat. We don't have time.

00:28:44.995 --> 00:28:46.079
Have some seaweed.

00:28:46.872 --> 00:28:48.248
I eat this every day.

00:28:48.332 --> 00:28:49.624
Really?

00:28:50.876 --> 00:28:52.377
There you are.

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:54.296
Can one of you come with me?

00:28:54.379 --> 00:28:55.255
Hurry.

00:28:55.922 --> 00:28:57.549
-Keep eating.
-What?

00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:01.595
-I'm eating your seaweed.
-Don't finish it!

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:03.972
Damn it.

00:29:05.349 --> 00:29:06.683
Over here, sir.

00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.226
Yes, this car.

00:29:11.188 --> 00:29:12.439
Actually, I…

00:29:17.903 --> 00:29:19.905
I'm so sorry.
Something came up unexpectedly.

00:29:19.988 --> 00:29:21.656
It's no problem at all.

00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:23.992
Yes.

00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:26.161
I was just on my way out.

00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.998
Yes, of course.
I'll call you when I get there.

00:29:30.082 --> 00:29:31.375
Okay.

00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:34.544
-He just started.
-Really?

00:29:34.628 --> 00:29:37.005
Make it quick, please.
I have to leave right now.

00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:38.256
Yes, sir.

00:29:47.974 --> 00:29:50.560
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HWANG TAE-SAN

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.444
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:03.156
I'm just on my way out now.

00:30:03.782 --> 00:30:06.326
I'm sorry. I must have missed that.

00:30:07.244 --> 00:30:08.995
Dinner? Tonight?

00:30:10.122 --> 00:30:12.541
Yes, I understand.

00:30:16.628 --> 00:30:18.964
Hey, open all the windows.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:24.553
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HWANG TAE-SAN

00:30:28.807 --> 00:30:30.100
Sir, are you okay?

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.853
I can't… I can't breathe.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.188
Are you okay?

00:30:35.272 --> 00:30:37.357
Yes, I'm fine.

00:30:37.441 --> 00:30:39.192
Sir,
please call the company clinic--

00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:40.235
No, don't!

00:30:41.403 --> 00:30:43.905
Not the company clinic. Don't.

00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:45.949
I'm fine.

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:47.993
Should I get you something to drink, then?

00:30:48.076 --> 00:30:49.161
Just some water, please.

00:30:49.244 --> 00:30:50.370
Just a moment, sir.

00:30:59.921 --> 00:31:00.922
Sir.

00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.634
If you're done here,
you can get back to work.

00:31:04.718 --> 00:31:07.637
I'm fine. I'm…

00:31:08.513 --> 00:31:09.598
fine…

00:31:16.396 --> 00:31:18.106
What are you doing here?

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.944
Why are you here…

00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:29.451
You turned me down

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:32.412
for this?

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.303
-That's not it, Jeong-tae.
-You…

00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:51.348
Do you have any idea what I went through

00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:53.683
to make you an executive?

00:31:53.767 --> 00:31:55.143
Don't try to talk.

00:31:55.227 --> 00:31:57.437
Jeong-tae, breathe slowly.

00:31:58.146 --> 00:31:59.606
And loosen your belt.

00:32:00.607 --> 00:32:01.858
You need to see a doctor.

00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:05.028
It's not fatal.
You were just startled, that's all.

00:32:06.196 --> 00:32:07.989
But it won't go away on its own.

00:32:08.073 --> 00:32:10.283
You need to see a doctor
and take medicine.

00:32:11.243 --> 00:32:13.995
I know what that's like.
You have to listen to me.

00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:16.665
And take things easy.

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:20.377
Sir!

00:32:22.546 --> 00:32:23.797
I brought you some water.

00:32:28.552 --> 00:32:30.178
Please take him to a doctor.

00:32:30.262 --> 00:32:31.346
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:52.867
Thank you.

00:32:57.664 --> 00:32:58.582
Thank you.

00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:00.000
Sure. Bye.

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:16.975
MANAGING DIRECTOR LEE HAN-NA

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.941
Dad.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.737
Are you going to a funeral?

00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:30.780
No.

00:33:30.864 --> 00:33:32.824
Can you give me a ride?

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.790
It's a mentorship interview for students.
Did they tell you to wear a suit?

00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:42.417
No, it's just…

00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:45.837
The interviewers are from the HR team
of a major corporation.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.590
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:33:50.425 --> 00:33:52.302
I need more experience, Dad.

00:33:53.762 --> 00:33:55.513
I'm still not sure what I like

00:33:55.597 --> 00:33:58.224
and what I want to be.

00:34:01.353 --> 00:34:03.021
You need experience?

00:34:05.106 --> 00:34:07.108
You retook your CSAT,

00:34:07.192 --> 00:34:09.277
worked at a startup,

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.821
even got scammed,

00:34:12.906 --> 00:34:16.034
and ran an online store.
A 20-year-old who's done all that?

00:34:17.702 --> 00:34:21.164
If you ask me, you've already got
more than enough experience.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.626
Out of all that, wasn't there
a single thing you enjoyed?

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.420
There was, but--

00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:28.463
There you go.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.257
Then what are you so unsure about?

00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:34.302
Just start from there, kid.

00:34:35.804 --> 00:34:37.681
Why make it so complicated?

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:46.815
Kim Su-gyeom?

00:34:47.482 --> 00:34:48.400
What?

00:34:48.483 --> 00:34:51.111
That's the Kim Su-gyeom I remember.

00:34:51.194 --> 00:34:55.573
A kid with a peculiar rebellious streak
and a stubborn, by-the-book nature.

00:34:55.657 --> 00:34:57.325
We make a good team, don't we?

00:34:57.409 --> 00:35:01.037
Why don't we get some stock
and start selling for real?

00:35:01.663 --> 00:35:05.083
Should we put something like this
on our hoodies?

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:08.753
If it weren't for you,
I couldn't have done anything.

00:35:09.254 --> 00:35:11.089
You make me

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:14.718
want to become something more.

00:35:15.927 --> 00:35:18.012
You'll figure it out somehow.

00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:23.518
HAN-NA

00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:27.188
I've arrived at the airport.
Take care while I'm gone.

00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:33.611
Dad, can you pull over up there?

00:35:37.365 --> 00:35:38.450
I'll call you, Dad.

00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:39.451
Okay.

00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:41.119
Thank you.

00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:52.255
Hello.

00:36:04.476 --> 00:36:05.435
Thank you.

00:36:12.317 --> 00:36:14.152
Attention passengers.

00:36:14.778 --> 00:36:16.654
Under aviation security rules,

00:36:16.738 --> 00:36:19.282
liquids and gels are not allowed

00:36:19.783 --> 00:36:21.409
in carry-on baggage…

00:36:21.493 --> 00:36:23.036
HAN-NA, WHERE ARE YOU?
WAIT FOR ME

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.746
…for international flights.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.969
I've been looking all over for you.

00:37:36.234 --> 00:37:38.027
Did you take a taxi again?

00:37:44.117 --> 00:37:45.326
Why'd you come?

00:37:47.954 --> 00:37:49.873
I really have to go now.

00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:53.585
I know.

00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:56.713
Look, I…

00:38:03.386 --> 00:38:04.846
I like you.

00:38:39.756 --> 00:38:40.882
Take it.

00:38:45.637 --> 00:38:46.846
What are you doing?

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.514
My apologies.

00:38:50.767 --> 00:38:52.560
You know, it just occurred to me

00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:56.147
that your office gets a lot of sunlight.

00:38:56.898 --> 00:39:00.944
I thought a little potted plant
by the window would be nice.

00:39:35.353 --> 00:39:36.813
2025 EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:38.648
ANNOUNCEMENT TIME CHANGED
TO 2:00 P.M. TODAY

00:39:43.444 --> 00:39:44.696
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:40:11.556 --> 00:40:13.099
-I'll be on my way, sir.
-Okay.

00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:14.559
Right. Yesterday,

00:40:15.143 --> 00:40:16.978
we got a yakgwa gift set delivered.

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:19.981
-Excuse me?
-It's from a client.

00:40:20.064 --> 00:40:22.567
I left it in the staff lounge
for everyone.

00:40:23.234 --> 00:40:25.653
Thank you. That's very kind.

00:40:25.737 --> 00:40:28.156
Grab a box and take it to Mr. Kim.

00:40:28.948 --> 00:40:30.408
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:31.868
He's nearby.

00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:36.247
And let me know
if he seems happy to get it.

00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:39.459
Thanks.

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:53.181
I should go pre-rinse that car.

00:41:04.317 --> 00:41:05.234
What is it?

00:41:05.818 --> 00:41:08.321
If you have something to say, say it.
I'm busy.

00:41:10.406 --> 00:41:12.033
I don't understand.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.659
What?

00:41:13.743 --> 00:41:15.953
Whatever Mr. Baek asked you to do,

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:18.456
was it really harder than this?

00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:22.001
If you were going to hide
and work wearing a mask,

00:41:22.085 --> 00:41:23.294
you could have just--

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:28.049
I'm sorry.

00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:30.510
Is this better?

00:41:32.929 --> 00:41:35.139
Do Jin-woo knows you work here.

00:41:35.973 --> 00:41:38.935
He told me to give this to you.

00:41:41.687 --> 00:41:42.730
You won't take it, right?

00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:45.817
I'll tell him you refused.

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:47.777
What is it?

00:41:48.778 --> 00:41:49.654
Yakgwa.

00:41:51.197 --> 00:41:52.949
Sounds delicious. Leave it.

00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:56.410
Leave it.

00:42:06.295 --> 00:42:08.131
I'll say you didn't take it.

00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:09.924
Why do you care about my pride?

00:42:10.007 --> 00:42:11.425
I don't know.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.470
I just wish you didn't accept it.

00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:17.306
I don't want to see
Do Jin-woo toying with you.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.516
You…

00:42:19.225 --> 00:42:20.309
really liked me, didn't you?

00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:22.395
Yes, I guess so.

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:25.439
The executive promotions
will be announced soon.

00:42:25.523 --> 00:42:27.775
You'll have to wash
Do Jin-woo's car starting tomorrow.

00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:29.527
Can you really do that?

00:42:32.446 --> 00:42:33.447
Sung-gu.

00:42:34.323 --> 00:42:37.076
Do you skip work
if you wake up in a bad mood?

00:42:39.287 --> 00:42:40.705
What kind of question is that?

00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:42.832
Come on.

00:42:43.457 --> 00:42:44.917
Get back to work.

00:42:49.797 --> 00:42:50.673
All right.

00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:14.989
One minute until the announcement.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.367
Why are you more worked up than I am?

00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:19.869
Fifty-five, fifty-four…

00:43:19.952 --> 00:43:21.621
-Get back to work.
-…fifty-three…

00:43:21.704 --> 00:43:23.956
-Go on.
-…fifty-two, fifty-one, fifty,

00:43:24.957 --> 00:43:26.834
forty-nine, forty-eight,

00:43:26.918 --> 00:43:30.129
forty-seven, forty-six, forty-five,

00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:31.923
forty-four, forty-three…

00:43:32.548 --> 00:43:34.550
The announcement is up.

00:43:38.596 --> 00:43:41.224
SALES DIVISION REORGANIZATION
AND EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:05.998
Nak-su, what are you doing?

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.167
Come on, let's finish this up.

00:44:08.251 --> 00:44:10.294
Okay, I'm coming.

00:44:35.903 --> 00:44:37.405
-Sir?
-Yes.

00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:39.323
This month's evaluation.

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:44.412
-Good work.
-You too.

00:44:44.495 --> 00:44:45.413
Nak-su, what is it?

00:44:48.332 --> 00:44:49.875
CAR WASH SERVICE WRITTEN EVALUATION

00:44:50.835 --> 00:44:52.086
Is this a decent score?

00:44:52.169 --> 00:44:53.087
SATISFIED

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.840
In corporate terms, it's an A.
So it's good, right?

00:44:55.923 --> 00:44:57.883
I used to always give you A's too.

00:45:00.594 --> 00:45:03.556
Then let's work harder, okay?
We need to renew our contract.

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:05.599
-Right.
-Sorry, I have to go now.

00:45:05.683 --> 00:45:07.476
-Hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:12.189
Hey, honey. I'm leaving now. Yes.

00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:23.951
"THE WAY BACK"

00:45:38.466 --> 00:45:40.051
…street corner

00:45:40.134 --> 00:45:43.304
Where I wait alone in sorrow

00:45:43.387 --> 00:45:47.183
Only the cold rain and wind

00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:51.145
Blow on my cheeks

00:45:51.228 --> 00:45:57.568
Even if I can't say I love you

00:45:58.652 --> 00:46:05.076
-I have to…
-I have to at least say goodbye

00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:09.163
The one who left

00:46:09.246 --> 00:46:11.207
Without a word--

00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:13.292
Why'd you turn it off?

00:46:13.376 --> 00:46:15.336
I hate it when people sing along with me.

00:46:17.797 --> 00:46:19.757
You probably just hated that it was me.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.219
I've seen you sing a duet
with Baek Jeong-tae…

00:46:26.263 --> 00:46:27.681
at karaoke quite a few times.

00:46:29.392 --> 00:46:31.394
You've been drinking.
Did you call for a driver?

00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:32.853
Yes, I did.

00:46:32.937 --> 00:46:34.772
Good. Head on out.

00:46:37.525 --> 00:46:39.652
You should have washed my car that day.

00:46:43.739 --> 00:46:46.450
I told you I needed some good luck.

00:46:52.665 --> 00:46:53.791
I didn't make it.

00:46:57.461 --> 00:47:00.214
I'm the designated driver.
Anyone going to Banpo-dong?

00:47:00.297 --> 00:47:02.258
That's me. What took you so long?

00:47:02.883 --> 00:47:05.469
I'm sorry. The entrance was hard to find.

00:47:06.303 --> 00:47:07.930
I called ages ago. Jeez.

00:47:09.723 --> 00:47:11.183
Give her the keys already.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.978
Thanks.

00:47:14.562 --> 00:47:16.063
Where is the car parked?

00:47:16.564 --> 00:47:17.857
Just press the button on the key.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.358
I'm too drunk to remember.

00:47:26.407 --> 00:47:28.784
I'm sorry.
You should call for another driver.

00:47:28.868 --> 00:47:29.869
What do you mean?

00:47:29.952 --> 00:47:32.872
From my experience,
I don't think this will end well.

00:47:33.372 --> 00:47:34.457
Take care.

00:47:35.124 --> 00:47:36.876
Wait a minute. Hey.

00:47:36.959 --> 00:47:39.211
-Ma'am, wait!
-Hey! Don't.

00:47:39.295 --> 00:47:41.672
-Where are you going?
-Enough. Don't.

00:47:42.423 --> 00:47:43.841
Can you believe this?

00:47:45.134 --> 00:47:47.052
Have I done something seriously wrong?

00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:50.222
That's for her to decide.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.479
Yes. You're right.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.986
I'm not the one who gets to decide.

00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:11.869
Call for another driver,
or figure it out yourself.

00:48:11.952 --> 00:48:12.995
I'm busy.

00:48:13.078 --> 00:48:14.246
Yes, sir.

00:48:25.049 --> 00:48:26.175
Mr. Kim.

00:48:28.761 --> 00:48:31.180
Why do you think I didn't make it?

00:48:33.474 --> 00:48:35.142
Did Mr. Hwang change his mind?

00:48:35.226 --> 00:48:38.604
Or did the other committee members object?

00:48:40.147 --> 00:48:41.565
Or maybe

00:48:42.149 --> 00:48:44.693
they thought I was
too young to be an executive.

00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:47.530
If not that, then was it because

00:48:48.155 --> 00:48:50.032
I only went to a junior college?

00:48:51.742 --> 00:48:53.077
Mr. Kim.

00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:58.415
Why on earth didn't I make it?

00:48:59.792 --> 00:49:01.544
What was the reason I was rejected?

00:49:03.337 --> 00:49:05.464
You know this company inside and out.

00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:07.383
Why did…

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:09.510
Why didn't I get it?

00:49:09.593 --> 00:49:11.053
I really don't know why.

00:49:12.054 --> 00:49:13.514
From the day I joined this company,

00:49:13.597 --> 00:49:16.850
the only thing I ever thought about
was my performance!

00:49:19.228 --> 00:49:20.479
I have…

00:49:24.817 --> 00:49:27.319
I have devoted 19 years of my life to ACT.

00:49:31.949 --> 00:49:34.201
That means I deserve to be

00:49:35.452 --> 00:49:38.122
an executive at least once, doesn't it?

00:49:43.877 --> 00:49:44.962
I get it.

00:49:48.966 --> 00:49:49.883
Then why…

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.388
Why!

00:49:56.015 --> 00:49:57.975
There was no competition, so why?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.970
Baek Jeong-tae is staying another year.

00:50:37.264 --> 00:50:40.476
He might just send me to the factory,
like he did with you.

00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:45.814
He probably won't.

00:50:47.149 --> 00:50:48.025
Why not?

00:50:48.108 --> 00:50:51.028
Because he needs you
to become an executive director.

00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:55.658
That's how the company
uses you and Baek Jeong-tae.

00:50:57.576 --> 00:51:00.162
I don't want to work for a company
that uses me like that anymore.

00:51:00.245 --> 00:51:01.914
Then quit, you punk.

00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:03.415
Your family's rich, right?

00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:06.335
That apartment isn't mine.

00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:08.754
It's in my in-laws' name.

00:51:10.005 --> 00:51:11.298
Is that right?

00:51:12.716 --> 00:51:13.926
That explains it.

00:51:15.928 --> 00:51:17.012
I see.

00:51:18.972 --> 00:51:20.224
Jeez.

00:51:21.392 --> 00:51:24.103
Now you seem more like the Mr. Kim I know.

00:51:24.812 --> 00:51:25.688
What, you punk?

00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:27.981
You seemed different until just now.

00:51:28.065 --> 00:51:29.400
To be honest,

00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:34.029
I thought you'd be happy that
I didn't become the managing director.

00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:41.203
I was secretly looking forward
to washing your car.

00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:46.375
I thought it might make me
feel a bit relieved.

00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:48.877
It's a shame it didn't happen.

00:51:54.967 --> 00:51:57.344
How have you been
since you left the company?

00:51:58.387 --> 00:51:59.972
What on earth happened to you

00:52:00.055 --> 00:52:02.808
that made you capable
of saying something like that?

00:52:09.148 --> 00:52:10.315
I'm sorry.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.528
We're not really the type
for cozy little talks like this.

00:52:16.989 --> 00:52:18.115
Right.

00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:22.578
BANPO BRIDGE
WELCOME TO SEOCHO

00:52:37.718 --> 00:52:38.761
Bye.

00:52:41.054 --> 00:52:42.389
Mr. Kim.

00:52:54.318 --> 00:52:55.360
Here.

00:53:07.414 --> 00:53:08.916
Mr. Kim, why…

00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:12.961
Why didn't I make it?

00:53:25.808 --> 00:53:27.643
Why did you want to be an executive?

00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:31.021
Excuse me?

00:53:31.104 --> 00:53:33.232
Not why you didn't make it.

00:53:34.525 --> 00:53:36.610
The reason you pushed yourself so hard

00:53:36.693 --> 00:53:38.821
and what you were living for.

00:53:39.488 --> 00:53:40.614
Do you know?

00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:51.959
Jin-woo.

00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:56.922
Try being honest with yourself.

00:53:58.841 --> 00:54:00.884
That should help you in life.

00:54:04.555 --> 00:54:05.639
Oh, and…

00:54:09.518 --> 00:54:10.894
I think I earned this much.

00:54:22.155 --> 00:54:23.282
I lost.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.410
I'm the one who lost.

00:54:43.427 --> 00:54:45.804
Do Jin-woo didn't quit the company.

00:54:46.638 --> 00:54:50.058
And just as I thought, Baek Jeong-tae
didn't send him to the factory.

00:54:50.726 --> 00:54:51.935
Will this even work?

00:54:54.313 --> 00:54:58.317
Their relationship
was one of mutual necessity.

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:00.152
I'll make it work.

00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:02.779
I'll get as much help as I can
from the other divisions.

00:55:02.863 --> 00:55:03.989
I'll go meet

00:55:04.907 --> 00:55:06.074
the support team.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.202
The AI surveillance camera package
and private network…

00:55:09.286 --> 00:55:11.830
These guys are still holding on
to their positions.

00:55:12.372 --> 00:55:13.749
…successfully rebounded.

00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:16.501
Recently, as fiscal tightening has eased,

00:55:16.585 --> 00:55:19.338
the volume of public institution bids
has been expanding again.

00:55:19.421 --> 00:55:21.465
-This means…
-The only thing that's changed

00:55:21.548 --> 00:55:24.593
is that they get to attend meetings again.

00:55:32.893 --> 00:55:33.810
Sir.

00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:39.191
The managing director
asked me to give you this.

00:55:39.942 --> 00:55:43.153
He wanted me to thank you
for always washing his car so well.

00:55:51.995 --> 00:55:54.665
BEEF SHORT RIBS

00:56:01.546 --> 00:56:03.966
This time, we get to eat it.

00:56:05.217 --> 00:56:06.927
Take your time and savor it.

00:56:07.552 --> 00:56:08.679
Here, say "Ah."

00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.389
It's so good.

00:56:28.281 --> 00:56:31.618
Su-gyeom is still juggling
his business and college.

00:56:33.745 --> 00:56:35.288
YONSEO UNIVERSITY
MENTORING PROGRAM

00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:39.126
Hello.

00:56:39.209 --> 00:56:41.712
I'm Assistant Manager Kwon Song-hee,
the mentor for Team 3.

00:56:41.795 --> 00:56:42.671
Nice to meet you.

00:56:45.048 --> 00:56:47.676
JOB BOOT CAMP WITH ACT
5-WEEK WORK EXPERIENCE WITH PROFESSIONALS

00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:58.854
What's with this font?
Why is it so festive?

00:56:58.937 --> 00:57:00.063
I'm sorry.

00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:03.859
Sales is all about the details.

00:57:04.651 --> 00:57:06.194
Am I right or wrong?

00:57:06.278 --> 00:57:08.447
Change it. Quickly. Now!

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:11.616
Not that one. No.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.953
He says the mentoring program
is harder than he expected.

00:57:15.037 --> 00:57:16.747
And this. What's with this blue color?

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:17.748
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:20.751
-Thank you for your hard work.
-And we failed to renew

00:57:21.251 --> 00:57:22.335
our contract with ACT.

00:57:22.419 --> 00:57:23.837
-This is so unfair.
-Hey.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.589
Don't make a scene. Let's go.

00:57:26.214 --> 00:57:28.300
We got fired from the same company twice.

00:57:29.134 --> 00:57:30.886
No, I can't anymore.

00:57:30.969 --> 00:57:33.305
We told them we quit
and walked out of there.

00:57:35.474 --> 00:57:36.641
What do I do now?

00:57:36.725 --> 00:57:38.852
You could say
I fired the company this time.

00:57:38.935 --> 00:57:40.062
That's right.

00:57:40.562 --> 00:57:42.022
-Not again.
-It's coming.

00:57:43.607 --> 00:57:45.525
Let's go get some barbecue.

00:57:47.319 --> 00:57:48.820
It's okay.

00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:53.533
It'll pass.

00:57:55.452 --> 00:57:57.662
I was just startled, that's all.

00:57:58.538 --> 00:57:59.873
I'm back.

00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:01.750
REFRESHING CAR WASH

00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:06.546
I ended up back at my brother's auto shop.

00:58:12.094 --> 00:58:14.304
There's one thing that's different.

00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:17.599
Listen. Let's lower the price
and separate interior and exterior washes.

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:19.810
At over two hours per car,
there's no profit in it.

00:58:19.893 --> 00:58:22.145
I officially went into business
with Heo Tae-hwan.

00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:25.232
In the end, managing our regulars
has to be our main focus.

00:58:25.315 --> 00:58:27.150
We'll be reservation-only.

00:58:27.234 --> 00:58:29.194
And with the customer data we collect,

00:58:29.277 --> 00:58:31.404
we can send out texts periodically.

00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:35.408
So, what I mean is,

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.328
let's go out and make some sales.

00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:43.416
And I now have time to take a walk
with my wife every night.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.376
Oh my.

00:58:48.588 --> 00:58:51.049
Gosh, it stings.

00:58:51.758 --> 00:58:53.802
Goodness, hurry up.

00:58:54.427 --> 00:58:55.637
Okay. Man.

00:58:58.056 --> 00:58:59.808
Gosh.

00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:02.853
Can you believe we're the only ones

00:59:03.478 --> 00:59:05.105
who were missing out on this?

00:59:05.188 --> 00:59:06.189
I know, right?

00:59:07.149 --> 00:59:11.069
I've worn dress shoes my whole life
and never knew what this felt like.

00:59:17.534 --> 00:59:19.035
Let's do it.

00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:21.037
Let's take over the office.

00:59:24.249 --> 00:59:26.835
Let's pay the 50 million won
for the rental premium.

00:59:27.919 --> 00:59:29.754
I have a steady income.

00:59:30.505 --> 00:59:31.506
So let's do it.

00:59:33.341 --> 00:59:36.219
Don't let that license
you worked so hard for go to waste.

00:59:42.684 --> 00:59:46.021
I'll think about it
until we get to that streetlight.

00:59:48.857 --> 00:59:50.275
-Honey.
-Yes?

00:59:51.234 --> 00:59:54.487
I know this is random,
but isn't it amazing sometimes?

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.199
That we're living like this?

00:59:57.908 --> 00:59:58.783
What?

00:59:59.326 --> 01:00:01.203
How did you know I was going to say that?

01:00:01.286 --> 01:00:02.704
I think about it a lot too.

01:00:03.997 --> 01:00:06.958
-Gosh.
-You know, back when we first met…

01:00:07.042 --> 01:00:08.293
Yes.

01:00:08.919 --> 01:00:10.795
If I hadn't

01:00:11.838 --> 01:00:14.216
run to that bus stop…

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:17.719
I wouldn't have been
the top performer that month, would I?

01:00:18.303 --> 01:00:20.055
Right. And…

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:25.352
We wouldn't even have Su-gyeom.

01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:26.478
Exactly.

01:00:28.688 --> 01:00:31.650
What would've happened

01:00:33.235 --> 01:00:36.821
if you hadn't pushed us
to buy that apartment?

01:00:37.364 --> 01:00:39.783
How would we have handled

01:00:39.866 --> 01:00:41.910
-the loan for the commercial unit?
-Jeez.

01:00:43.828 --> 01:00:45.372
And what would've happened…

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:49.793
if I hadn't bought that commercial unit?

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.879
-If you hadn't…
-Yes.

01:00:54.631 --> 01:00:56.758
…then you might've caused a bigger mess.

01:00:58.343 --> 01:00:59.970
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.224
Let's just say

01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:07.769
we got off lightly.

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:09.896
It could've been worse.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.816
How do you stay so positive?
You're amazing.

01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:15.694
Not everyone can do what you did.

01:01:16.444 --> 01:01:19.614
Who else would think to wash cars
in the parking lot of a company

01:01:19.698 --> 01:01:21.950
they'd worked at for 25 years?

01:01:22.534 --> 01:01:24.494
Anyone could do it.

01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:26.121
It's just for the money.

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.039
You're trying to play it cool again.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.089
Only Kim Nak-su would make that choice.

01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:40.635
Anyone else would've stumbled,
and that would've been the end of them.

01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:42.512
Only you, Kim Nak-su,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.098
could have made it this far.

01:01:46.474 --> 01:01:48.018
That's how I see it.

01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:54.399
So let's take it easy from now on, okay?

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:57.569
Let's take small steps

01:01:57.652 --> 01:02:00.405
so that even if we fall,
we won't get hurt too badly.

01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:03.450
Barefoot. Just like this.

01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:17.422
I don't want to take over the office
and pay for the rental premium.

01:02:17.505 --> 01:02:18.882
That's no fun.

01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:23.345
I want to build something
from scratch on my own.

01:02:24.804 --> 01:02:26.431
That's more my style.

01:02:26.514 --> 01:02:29.559
If you do something
you're not cut out for, it can backfire.

01:02:30.185 --> 01:02:31.603
So what's the better move?

01:02:31.686 --> 01:02:33.063
Pretty obvious, right?

01:02:36.066 --> 01:02:36.941
Park Ha-jin.

01:02:38.026 --> 01:02:39.611
Why are you

01:02:40.987 --> 01:02:42.280
so adorable?

01:02:45.825 --> 01:02:46.743
Kim Nak-su.

01:02:48.078 --> 01:02:49.788
Why do you make me

01:02:51.039 --> 01:02:52.165
feel sorry for you?

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.632
You're amazing, Park Ha-jin.

01:03:03.635 --> 01:03:06.012
You're great, Kim Nak-su.

01:03:07.222 --> 01:03:08.890
You're scary, Park Ha-jin.

01:03:12.102 --> 01:03:14.145
You're cute, Kim Nak-su.

01:03:16.731 --> 01:03:19.776
-This is nice, right?
-It is.

01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:21.111
Let's walk more often.

01:03:21.611 --> 01:03:24.656
Okay. Should we take a picture?

01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:26.950
-What?
-Let's take one to remember this.

01:03:27.033 --> 01:03:28.618
A selfie. Here.

01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:30.954
Hold on.

01:03:32.664 --> 01:03:35.417
One, two, three.

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:39.838
REFRESHING CAR WASH

01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:55.353
Can I have it?

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:57.272
Go ahead.

01:04:00.191 --> 01:04:01.484
I'll be back.

01:04:01.568 --> 01:04:02.777
Hey, I have the card.

01:04:02.861 --> 01:04:04.446
-What? Right.
-The card.

01:04:04.529 --> 01:04:06.781
Don't buy the jumbo-sized wax.
Get the small one.

01:04:06.865 --> 01:04:08.283
-Okay.
-You always go big.

01:04:08.366 --> 01:04:09.951
-Okay.
-Big appetite, big head.

01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:11.453
Hey, stop it.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.052
Shoot!

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:30.054
Jeez.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.890
Man!

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:37.187
-Get inside!
-It's a rain shower!

01:04:44.319 --> 01:04:45.361
Gosh.

01:04:47.697 --> 01:04:49.908
Where did this rain suddenly come from?

01:04:52.619 --> 01:04:54.120
We just have to wait it out.

01:04:54.204 --> 01:04:55.205
Let's take a break.

01:04:58.666 --> 01:04:59.667
Oh man.

01:05:26.528 --> 01:05:28.279
Nak-su! Get in here.

01:05:29.113 --> 01:05:31.407
Tell me right now. Can you do it or not?

01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:34.077
What should I do?
Please tell me.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.746
-Come on, what do I do?
-Are you HQ's errand boy?

01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:39.541
You might as well be the errand boy.
What else would you do?

01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:41.834
Sir. You don't want
the extra 200,000 won?

01:05:41.918 --> 01:05:43.545
Let's stop here.

01:05:43.628 --> 01:05:45.296
Mr. Kim.
Please take care of this.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.674
Can you take the lead
and try to sort it out?

01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:50.218
I don't think we can solve this that way.

01:05:50.301 --> 01:05:51.344
You punk.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.471
-What you're doing isn't work.
-Mr. Kim.

01:05:53.555 --> 01:05:54.764
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:57.475
-Nak-su!
-Come to your senses, Kim Nak-su!

01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:01.938
Dad.

01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:04.774
Hey, Mr. Unemployed.
Hey there, unemployed Mr. Kim.

01:06:04.857 --> 01:06:07.694
We made 340,000 won, Dad.

01:06:07.777 --> 01:06:09.404
I landed my first contract today.

01:06:09.487 --> 01:06:11.864
Why would I be ashamed
of you for working?

01:06:11.948 --> 01:06:14.117
I'm just worried
you'll get into an accident.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.119
You don't have to push yourself.

01:06:16.202 --> 01:06:17.453
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.372
What are you sorry for?

01:06:19.872 --> 01:06:21.040
Thank you, Dad.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.543
You've been through so much.

01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:25.169
General Manager Kim.

01:06:27.547 --> 01:06:28.590
Nak-su.

01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:31.801
Be happy.

01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:39.767
Lunchtime!

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:44.814
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:08:59.949 --> 01:09:01.951
