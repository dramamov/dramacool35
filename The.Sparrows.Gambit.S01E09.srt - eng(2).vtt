00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
[Episode 9]

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.060
I have a shipment.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.660
I'll use your dock.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.660
Bring it back intact.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.300
This is your final chance.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.460
Do you want to know

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.260
who killed the Lin family back then?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.860
It was my father.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.580
Your so-called savior.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.300
He planned it.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.700
Get the kid out.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.220
Yes.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.260
After the Lin family fire,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.260
my father saved you.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.220
He let you live ten more years

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.020
as Qingmao.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.460
From today, you will

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.620
enter the Wang family's orphanage
for training.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.300
Lin Qingyi,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.580
from now on, you are Qingmao.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.220
I will help you

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.420
find the one who murdered your family.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.220
This time, at any cost,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.740
the Wang family's crimes
must be exposed to the world.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.660
Rumeng. Rumeng!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.140
Rumeng,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.700
I know you are Qingmao.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.820
But with your strength alone,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.780
how can you
take on the entire Wang family?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.580
Chick, today, this shipment and you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.900
are mine to take.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.980
We'll see

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.380
if you have what it takes.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.060
Get her!

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.900
Chen Wenbin!

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.020
Look out!

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.100
An ugly freak.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.460
An abandoned boy.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.780
I am not abandoned!

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.620
My father will come for me!

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.860
Are you okay?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.780
I'm fine.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.300
My face is ugly.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.500
No, it's not.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.500
The ones who hit you are the ugly ones.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.100
I'm Su Jinmo.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.660
I just came to the orphanage a year ago.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.660
What's your name?

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.820
My name is Lin...

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.700
My name is Qingmao.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.820
I haven't seen you

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.100
around the orphanage lately.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.700
Are you an orphan too?

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.500
I live on the back hill.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.260
My mom and dad, they both...

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.860
We fight side by side today.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.420
That makes us family.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.820
This Tiger-Head Lock is our pledge.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.620
I will always protect you.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.820
Su Jinmo, you got candy again!

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.900
I didn't mean to...

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.900
Does it hurt?

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.940
It's fine.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.460
Candy makes it stop hurting.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.980
Su Jinmo,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.980
come out here for a moment.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.860
Wait for me.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.300
Your family is here to pick you up.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.620
I... I'm not going!

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.740
Let go of me!

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.620
Jinmo!

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.220
Jinmo!

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.020
Qingmao!

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.060
Jinmo!

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.700
Su Jinmo.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.380
It's you.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.860
You... you're hurt.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.980
Liu Rumeng,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.020
did you really think
you could take the cargo?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.940
Only I am authorized to collect

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.740
the Wang family's cargo.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.500
So,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.820
you admit this belongs
to the Wang family?

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.620
It does!

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.380
Come on, look at the camera.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.380
Everyone, smile!

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.300
Opium trafficking is a serious case.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.700
I'm here reporting live
for the Song City Daily.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.260
Before you pin such a serious charge
on us,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.500
you should see

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.260
what's really inside.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.020
Tea?

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.700
A bit damp.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.060
Liu Rumeng,

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.100
you really work hard
for other's thing, huh?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.980
Thanks to you,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.020
the Wang family's shipment

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.420
should have arrived safely by now.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.180
Sir! Sir!

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.260
The goods have been supplied.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.100
The funds have been covered. Look.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.380
It seems Liu Rumeng isn't
so formidable after all.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.100
At the scene,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.820
who else was there?

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.260
It was Marshal Chen
who called the police.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.460
He protected Miss Liu.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.580
I knew it was him.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.620
Deliver all these funds
to the Chen family.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.900
Wan'er and Wenbin are to be married
immediately.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.140
What about Liu Rumeng?

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.900
Should we still keep watch on her?

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.380
Of course, we keep watch.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.740
Right now,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.100
she's a bird in a cage.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.180
We must keep her under our eyes.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.860
Give her my terms.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.020
And she will accept them.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.460
Otherwise, Chen Wenbin

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.740
will die.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.500
Understood.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.860
Still so fierce, are you?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.580
Go on, show me how fierce you are.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.500
Marshal Chen,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.100
please control yourself.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.780
Wenbin!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.540
Dad!

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.980
Dad, hurry up and announce it!

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.500
Look how impatient you are.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.620
Now that everyone is here,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.020
I will make the announcement.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.860
Today

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.180
is a joyous occasion,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.700
a day of double happiness.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.660
This first blessing

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.500
is that...

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.500
Wenbin,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.020
your father has agreed

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.500
to your marriage to Wan'er.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.580
Dad, you only mentioned one thing to me.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.100
What is the other?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.300
As for the second blessing...

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.220
Wenbin,
it is also a great occasion for me.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.700
Miss Liu

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.300
will shortly become

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.460
my concubine.
