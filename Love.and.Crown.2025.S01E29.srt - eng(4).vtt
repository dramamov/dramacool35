00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.800
No victory comes

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.750
without risk.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.630
It's time to take the gamble.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:28.990
Father!

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.350
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.080
Physician Li,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.960
didn't you send word to the palace

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.630
that my father showed signs of waking?

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.160
Me?

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.630
I...

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.560
I don't recall...

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.830
Oh, no.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:55.870
It's Xiao Huan.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.830
Something has happened in the palace.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.510
The Imperial Father-in-law has awakened!

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.440
Father.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.040
Father.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.080
You're awake.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.080
Father!

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.800
Cangcang...

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.440
Yes?

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.630
What is it?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.280
Preceptor Du...

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.350
Preceptor Du?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.510
He knew Preceptor Du was the mastermind,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.320
so he arranged to draw me away from the palace.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.760
Cangcang...

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.720
Entrusting the jade seal to you

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.410
was his way

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.170
of ensuring your survival

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.930
and leaving

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.950
his last spark of hope.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.430
He won't succeed.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.590
I vowed

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.430
I'd stand or fall with him.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.550
I can make it.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.880
Xiao Huan,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.000
wait for me.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.040
I'm sorry.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.960
For some reason,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.680
I felt I had to say that to you.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.700
Qianqing.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.480
Why are you here?

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.640
Ying's cause of death is unclear.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.120
Regardless of what happened,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.990
I can't let her die without answers.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.840
I must investigate.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.960
Her cause of death is unclear?

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.070
Weren't you the one who killed her?

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.840
If she truly died because of me,

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.790
I won't

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.200
deny it.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.790
Don't bother.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.070
I hate myself

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.920
for ever agreeing to let you

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.230
remove the poison from Ying.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.710
I should have taken her from this palace,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.360
from this wretched place.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.070
Ying's death is on our hands,

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.990
you and I.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.550
Xiao Qianqing,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.360
calm yourself and think this through.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.450
Doesn't Ying's death seem suspicious?

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.400
Do you want even her death

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.720
exploited?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.210
Suspicious?

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.440
Elaborate.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.800
She was nearly cured,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.230
then this happened out of the blue.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.150
Think harder.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.840
Maybe someone

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.190
didn't want her to regain her wits.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.280
Lies!

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.840
My Ying passed without finding peace.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.910
Qianqing,

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.800
look at your sister.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.190
How can you be shaken by a few words

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.280
from him?

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:33.630
Mother,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.710
he has no reason to kill Ying at all.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.950
You forgot.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.080
Ying caused him to lose his child.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.990
The Empress's first child.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.120
Do you really believe

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.670
he had no reason to harm Ying?

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.990
I've said

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.560
I won't pursue it.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.520
One can bide one's time for the right opportunity to seek vengeance.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.320
Your schemes run deeper than the sea.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.520
Qianqing,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.670
will you never understand?

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.950
No.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.950
We grew up together.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.950
Though he's cunning,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.560
he is not that sort of man.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.840
My foolish son.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.390
How can you be so innocent as to believe

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.840
in brotherhood and sincerity

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.360
within these palace walls?

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.390
There's nothing to gain

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.040
from him killing Ying.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:29.880
Gain?

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.360
Ling Xuefeng already made him wary.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.950
He fears more palace unrest,

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.990
another upheaval.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.800
He only wants to eliminate opponents.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.670
He claims Ying's death

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.080
was meant to incriminate someone.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.360
Surely it's aimed at implicating me.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.630
He already took out Ling Xuefeng.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.800
Now, it's my turn.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.360
You'll be next.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.390
We will all become sacrifices

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.430
to his consolidation of power.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.670

Trust me.

He only wants to find the mastermind.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.710
The mastermind?

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.040
Who?

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.390
He is the mastermind!

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.840
He killed Ying!

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.390
Qianqing...

Qianqing,

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.230
would you rather trust him

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.880
than me?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.630
Ying.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.390
Your brother

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.910
distrusts and defies me

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.190
utterly.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:56.760
I might as well

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.880
join you among the departed.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.630
Mother, what did you take?

Mother!

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.910
Qianqing,

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.630
you've grown distant

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.520
as you matured.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.950
But everything I do

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.040
is for you.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.950
You may not believe me,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.670
but remember,

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.190
here in this palace,

Even if you refuse to contend,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.560
your foes will never spare you.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.880
Do not...

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.470
Do not

00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.950
be deceived

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.390
by him again...

Are you satisfied now?

Is this what you wanted?

the Prince of Yuzhang has made a move against His Majesty.

Yes, Madam.

You've always called my mother's life fragile as paper.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.560
You're afraid love will destroy me

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.990

Rest assured.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.280
I will no longer let affections dictate my life.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.630

Preceptor Du,

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.910
we've searched the entire palace.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.430
The Empress is not here.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.190
You let Ling Cangcang escape!

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.230
Relay my orders.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.950
Should the Empress return,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.800
kill her on sight.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.470
Understood.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.360
I have already rebelled.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.630
Why should I balk at one more death?

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.880
Kill him!

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.760
Stop!

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.470
He is the Emperor of Great Qi.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.040
You cannot kill him on a whim.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.760
Prince of Yuzhang,

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.560
he has betrayed you so.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.800
Don't you want his life?

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.080
My sister died.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.040
My mother died to prove her cause.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.520
Killing him outright

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.670
would be too easy on him.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.950
Take His Majesty away to rest.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.430
Prince of Yuzhang,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.710
I'm helping you.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.560
Helping me?

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.230
All these years, your fealty was to Xiao Huan.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.520
Yet now you turn to aid me instead?

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.840
I am the Imperial Preceptor.

I serve Great Qi.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.670
My loyalty is not to one man,

nor just to Xiao Huan.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.360
But to the world,

to support Your Highness's ascension.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.760
Do you think

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.280
I would trust a madwoman?

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.120
I have never

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.560
sought the throne.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.390
You will want it.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.670
slaughtered Princess Ying

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.080
and drove the Empress Dowager to despair,

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.190
all to secure his throne.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.560
If he desires the throne so,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.280
why not take it from him?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.190
When you become Emperor,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.910
watch how remorseful

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.840
your brother will be.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.040
That will be justice served.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.670
Why?

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.710
Why do you revolt then?

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.880
If you wish to ally with me,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:55.320
I must know why.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.560
Or how can I trust you?

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.670
Why do I rebel?

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.120
He gave Ling Cangcang

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.470
the remedy meant to save himself.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.150
His very life I wrested from death's grasp,

needling meridians without respite!

If he won't cherish his life,

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.280
then I must be the one to destroy it.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.560
You truly are a pitiful lunatic.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.760
Indeed.

Thus, I can no longer indulge in such affections.

Either way,

I no longer deserve to.

On the day my mother and Ying are laid to rest,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.990
I want Xiao Huan to die as penance.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.230
But until then,

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.630
I want him alive.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.630

That's why I'm here

You've always known who I truly am.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.320
You've never received the late Emperor's love,

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.640
so you refuse

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.030
to let any woman he favored live.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:00.510

The truth is, the poison I gave you

Why is Her Highness not given a funeral and interment in the Imperial Mausoleum?

This defies all custom.

When she was alive, she languished in the cold palace.
