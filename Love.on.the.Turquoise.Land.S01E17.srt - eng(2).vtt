00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:49.808
(Wanbao Tower, Welcome)

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:56.815
Well,

00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:59.255
you came personally to pick up medicine?

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:00.615
You could've told me.

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:01.776
I could've delivered it.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:03.815
Ms. Lin instructed me to come.

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:06.136
Ms. Lin?

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.615
Was it really Ms. Lin's instruction?

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:10.296
Or did you want to come yourself

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.976
to chat with me
and vent some frustrations?

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:21.775
Lin Ling,

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.215
lately,

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.016
I've had this persistent feeling.

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:28.455
Help me analyze this.

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:33.296
Should I not

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:35.976
have the surname Lv?

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:38.416
I should be named 'Pin.'

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:42.256
For the character's extra mouth?

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.455
No, that's not what I meant.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.495
'Pin' for 'savor.'
I'm someone worth savoring.

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:47.856
The more you savor me,

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.296
the more you appreciate me.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.495
Like stinky tofu, durian,
or river snail noodles?

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:56.215
Close enough.

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:58.615
They're all addictive foods.

00:02:58.816 --> 00:02:59.935
Once hooked, you can't quit.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:02.416
I'm like traditional medicine.

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.136
The longer it brews,
the more potent it becomes.

00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:08.696
And the longer it brews,
the richer the flavor.

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:14.735
Check me out then.

00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:17.256
I feel like my life's been flavorless.

00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:25.335
I can't cure that.

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:28.735
My medicine treats bodies, not hearts.

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:31.935
For emotional wounds,

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:33.455
go wander around more.

00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:35.215
Having fun works best.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:51.816
Don't you think

00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.935
I'm just like caged livestock?

00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:56.215
I have no future

00:03:57.455 --> 00:03:58.495
and nowhere to escape.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:03.335
Give me the medicine.

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:06.895
Tell Ms. Lin

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:08.495
the dosage remains the same as before.

00:04:09.296 --> 00:04:10.576
This soup's for you.

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:13.055
No medicinal effects.

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:14.455
Just tastes good.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.535
We usually check girls' pulses
on the right hand.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:42.816
You're back.

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:43.975
Tuo.

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:45.455
Whatever I say later,

00:04:45.455 --> 00:04:46.736
just play along with me.

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:48.936
Lots of good food today

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:49.696
waiting for you.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:50.335
Come join us.

00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:20.376
You went to Wanbao Tower?

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.095
To get Ms. Lin's medicine.

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:29.056
Is Lv Xian doing well?

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:34.736
He's perfectly fine.

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:39.376
So you two are getting along?

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:47.215
Tuo, what are you doing?

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:51.535
If it works, take it further.

00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:53.335
If not, make a clean break.

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:55.176
Ms. Lin cares about you two.

00:05:55.256 --> 00:05:56.736
At least give her a clear answer.

00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:00.256
I...

00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:05.095
I...

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:08.855
I don't know.

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:12.775
Afraid of misjudging? Uncertain, huh?

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:20.215
Let me give you some advice.

00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:24.696
Alright, go ahead.

00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:28.975
Take a trip together.

00:06:29.335 --> 00:06:30.496
Spend a few days together.

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:31.855
Any flaws will surface naturally.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:34.816
Where should we go?

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:36.335
Somewhere nearby.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:37.935
Ms. Lin wouldn't approve of long trips.

00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:39.056
Listen.

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:41.576
Xicang in the north,
Heyang in the south.

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:43.855
Hanlin for landscapes
and Luhang for cuisine.

00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:45.496
Hanlin's scenery is quite nice.

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:46.535
Why not go there?

00:06:49.696 --> 00:06:50.855
I'm fine with that.

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:54.295
Anyway, I've never been anywhere.

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:57.056
Look at you being shy.

00:06:57.895 --> 00:06:58.855
If you're so shy,

00:06:58.855 --> 00:06:59.816
I'll come with you.

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.215
Aren't you supposed to play matchmaker?

00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:14.215
Why be a third wheel?

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.895
She's bad with words.

00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:20.775
If things go south,

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.576
I'll need to feed her lines.

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.256
Right?

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:28.775
Feng Mi.

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:30.895
You should go too.

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:33.655
Good chance to relax and unwind.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:34.496
Sure.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:35.816
When do we leave?

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:39.215
I'll contact Lv Xian first.

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:40.936
It's settled then.

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:41.655
To Hanlin.

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:46.936
Okay, thanks.

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:54.816
How about you try a bit harder?

00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:57.176
Just pair us up already.

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:00.376
I can watch him 24/7 for you.

00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:03.616
You think this is a real vacation?

00:08:05.376 --> 00:08:07.576
After spending days together,

00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:10.496
I haven't noticed any major flaws.

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:13.616
Your son

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.415
is just perfect in every way.

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:21.016
You're not taking this charade
for real, are you?

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:24.936
You taught me,

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.215
"To act human,

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:29.056
one must show real feelings."

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:31.775
Blurring fake and real is one thing,

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:33.575
but priorities matter most.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:36.935
Ms. Lin,

00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:39.216
I'm just blowing off steam.

00:08:39.695 --> 00:08:40.775
I'd never lay a finger

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.695
on your treasure.

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:46.376
Gou Ya's gone.

00:08:46.535 --> 00:08:49.096
No word from Chen Fu either.

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:51.935
Li Yueying sabotaged Qin Chi,

00:08:51.935 --> 00:08:53.456
so she couldn't remain.

00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:55.856
Our numbers dwindle,

00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:57.856
and problems grow.

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:02.496
So you must keep Tuo in check for me.

00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:05.016
No more complications.

00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:09.376
Don't worry. I've got this.

00:09:31.736 --> 00:09:32.535
Folks,

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:35.456
grab some buns for the road.

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.256
Dr. Lv, you're so thoughtful.

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:38.336
It's just what we wanted.

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:41.655
This is Feng Mi, right?

00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:42.192
Yes.

00:09:42.192 --> 00:09:43.175
Tuo often mentions you.

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:45.695
I'm Lv Xian, a doctor.

00:09:46.016 --> 00:09:47.096
Doctor's compassion.

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:48.456
Have a bun.

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:51.055
Men, no lotus. Women, no chives.

00:09:51.055 --> 00:09:51.976
It's pork and scallion.

00:09:53.616 --> 00:09:55.216
Eat more. You're too skinny.

00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:56.695
Your thigh loses to most arms.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:09:59.775
Ling, the soy milk's in the back.

00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:02.736
What fillings do you have?

00:10:05.175 --> 00:10:06.616
What's going on?

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:08.456
I need to go to Hanlin.

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.376
Cover for me with Lin Ling later.

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:13.096
Keep this game going.

00:10:13.096 --> 00:10:13.496
Want some?

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.175
Liven things up. Play it by ear.

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:17.295
At least tell me the song's theme.

00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:18.415
Improvise.

00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:19.175
Let's go.

00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:42.736
What now?

00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.496
Food coma strikes?

00:10:45.055 --> 00:10:46.535
I'll play a tune.

00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:47.815
To wake you up.

00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:55.895
How's this?

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:56.976
More lively, right?

00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:04.336
You're a medic.
Know about smelling salts?

00:11:05.016 --> 00:11:06.935
The stuff that wakes up
fainted patients?

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:08.295
How do they work?

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:11.376
Honestly? No fancy science.

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:13.575
Just stink people awake.

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.695
Exactly.

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:18.376
Your tune works the same way.

00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:19.895
I'm wide awake now.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:24.856
Not bad.

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.175
That was a slick clapback, huh?

00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:29.575
You,

00:11:29.976 --> 00:11:31.216
a spoiled brat,

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:33.695
need to improve your artistic taste.

00:11:34.336 --> 00:11:36.376
The crassest is the classiest. Get it?

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:38.256
By the way,

00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:41.175
aren't you a pro, Mi?

00:11:41.655 --> 00:11:43.175
Judge my tune, would you?

00:11:44.256 --> 00:11:46.976
Customers often request such music.

00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:48.616
See, Mr. Yan?

00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:51.136
You're too detached from common folks.

00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:53.456
For people like this,

00:11:53.456 --> 00:11:54.655
I don't call security.

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:55.695
I kick them out myself.

00:11:55.695 --> 00:11:56.695
Right call.

00:11:58.376 --> 00:11:59.175
Fine.

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:01.376
What, you guys study comic cross-talk?

00:12:01.376 --> 00:12:03.376
Can't roast
without setup-punchline routines?

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:06.096
Alright. Mi,

00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:07.055
you're the pro.

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:08.175
Play something decent

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:09.295
to cleanse my ears.

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:20.695
Good grief.

00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:24.136
The tune suits you well.

00:12:36.815 --> 00:12:39.456
Find a rest area up ahead.

00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:40.736
My stomach's acting up.

00:12:41.175 --> 00:12:42.456
We just entered the highway.

00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:43.695
Where should I find one?

00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:45.695
Your buns must've been bad.

00:12:47.055 --> 00:12:48.616
Shouldn't have bought them.

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:49.935
You bite the hand that feeds.

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:50.815
Hurry.

00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:07.256
The youngsters are hanging out.

00:13:07.256 --> 00:13:08.736
Why make us follow them?

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:11.535
Because Ms. Lin isn't stupid.

00:13:13.256 --> 00:13:14.736
Xicang has enough space

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:16.096
for the four of them.

00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:19.376
Running out to play at this time,

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:20.895
they must be plotting something.

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:22.376
Isn't Feng Mi with them?

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:25.256
Her petty schemes
can't outsmart Yan Tuo.

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:28.935
True.

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:31.096
She's already been lured by him.

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:34.415
I can't hold it.

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:36.295
It's killing me.

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:36.976
Drive faster.

00:13:36.976 --> 00:13:37.655
Hold it in.

00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:39.456
I really can't hold it.

00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:40.775
Just hurry.

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:43.655
Go.

00:13:44.175 --> 00:13:45.216
My stomach's cramping.

00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:48.496
What's happening?

00:13:48.496 --> 00:13:49.256
The toilet.

00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:50.456
I can't wait.

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:55.376
Got to refuel.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.895
Then I'll grab some food.

00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:20.856
Yan Tuo went to the toilet.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:24.016
The other guy got out too.

00:14:24.216 --> 00:14:25.415
He went to the nearby stall.

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:26.695
And the girl?

00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:28.775
She's right by the car.

00:14:29.295 --> 00:14:31.055
The Earth Fiend's
guarding the toilet door.

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:33.175
Yan Tuo's under close watch.

00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:37.096
A car's been following behind us.

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:39.175
Probably Lin Xirou's people too.

00:15:00.096 --> 00:15:02.256
Hello? I'll reach Hanlin soon.

00:15:02.456 --> 00:15:03.575
Give me the exact location.

00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:06.096
Mr. Yan, plans have changed.

00:15:06.535 --> 00:15:07.376
See you in Licheng.

00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:09.175
Why?

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.775
Last-minute changes complicate it.

00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:12.336
Then you need to act fast.

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:14.775
I won't wait long in Licheng.

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:15.736
Wait.

00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:26.376
Licheng?

00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:33.336
Is this tasty?

00:15:33.856 --> 00:15:34.815
This one's sweet.

00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:36.535
Okay.

00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:44.336
Would you like it?

00:15:44.655 --> 00:15:45.456
Keep it.

00:16:27.456 --> 00:16:28.415
Put it down.

00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:29.935
He might drop his phone

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:30.895
when reaching for it.

00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:34.096
Well, Tuo

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:35.815
has plenty of good qualities.

00:16:36.136 --> 00:16:38.295
The punctual,
high-quality daily 'delivery'

00:16:38.295 --> 00:16:39.336
is one of them.

00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:43.815
He might skip meals,

00:16:43.935 --> 00:16:45.256
but never his toilet breaks.

00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:46.695
That's dedication.

00:16:47.616 --> 00:16:49.175
Wait, I'll hurry him up.

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:56.535
Are you pinching it off?

00:16:58.295 --> 00:16:58.976
Here.

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:00.775
Wait.

00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:01.815
What's wrong?

00:17:03.695 --> 00:17:06.736
Xiong Hei and some long-haired person
are in the parking lot too.

00:17:07.295 --> 00:17:08.696
They must've tailed us.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:10.656
I knew it.

00:17:13.256 --> 00:17:14.456
Speed it up.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.055
Stop dawdling.

00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:20.535
Xing Shen changed the meeting spot.

00:17:21.135 --> 00:17:22.375
And Feng Mi sticks close.

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:23.496
Are you ever done?

00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:24.575
Xiong Hei brought someone.

00:17:24.696 --> 00:17:25.815
They've been following.

00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:27.335
We have no chance now.

00:17:27.815 --> 00:17:29.575
- It keeps growing.
- We'll improvise.

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:35.496
Weak spleen and stomach.

00:17:36.335 --> 00:17:37.295
It needs attention.

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:39.295
Even heroes can't endure diarrhea.

00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:40.095
Right.

00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:41.456
Let alone making two ladies

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:42.535
smell this while waiting

00:17:42.535 --> 00:17:43.575
doesn't make you heroic.

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.535
Mi's getting impatient.

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:47.335
Right, my apologies.

00:17:47.456 --> 00:17:48.936
It's my stomach. Sorry for the wait.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.095
I was scrolling through my phone

00:17:55.095 --> 00:17:57.055
and saw Licheng's having
a hotpot festival.

00:17:57.055 --> 00:17:58.216
Should we check it out?

00:17:59.855 --> 00:18:00.575
Licheng?

00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:05.095
The super popular one,

00:18:05.095 --> 00:18:06.696
the quadrennial hotpot event, right?

00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:07.416
Yeah.

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:08.615
Perfect timing.

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:09.335
Exactly.

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:10.456
We must go.

00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:11.335
Time waits for none.

00:18:11.496 --> 00:18:12.016
Let's go.

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:12.775
Come on.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:15.496
Eating hotpot with your stomach?

00:18:17.016 --> 00:18:18.416
We can get a split pot.

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:19.815
Plain for me, spicy for you.

00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:21.375
It suits our personalities, right?

00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:23.456
Brilliant.

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:25.256
The symbolism is nice too.

00:18:25.575 --> 00:18:28.976
A split pot comes in pairs,
like people in love. Right?

00:18:34.256 --> 00:18:36.416
It's been ages since I had hotpot.

00:18:36.855 --> 00:18:38.575
Let's go.
I've already set the navigation.

00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:39.456
I'll drive.

00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:40.135
Perfect.

00:18:40.176 --> 00:18:42.135
You should eat more yam. Got it?

00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:43.736
It'll help your digestion.

00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:46.575
Wait, the snacks.

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:48.815
Hotpot time.

00:18:51.936 --> 00:18:53.736
Yan Tuo and the others are out.

00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:00.976
Why change the meeting spot?

00:19:02.456 --> 00:19:03.696
The intel update was quick.

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:06.575
Yan Tuo's being tailed by Earth Fiends.

00:19:06.575 --> 00:19:07.775
He can't shake them off.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:08.575
You need to hurry.

00:19:08.575 --> 00:19:09.375
I know.

00:19:12.295 --> 00:19:13.335
You're following them too?

00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:15.936
I'm not sure if he's playing games.

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:17.535
The escape could be disguised bait.

00:19:17.936 --> 00:19:19.216
Him feeding you intel

00:19:20.055 --> 00:19:21.696
could be part of a trap.

00:19:22.095 --> 00:19:23.496
I told you long ago.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.095
Yan Tuo is trustworthy.

00:19:25.216 --> 00:19:25.896
Sorry.

00:19:26.615 --> 00:19:27.896
About whether he's trustworthy,

00:19:28.575 --> 00:19:29.656
I'll decide for myself.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.696
(Roadsound Pharmaceuticals)

00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:44.736
(Luo: Xing Shen is after you.
Be careful.)

00:20:50.815 --> 00:20:51.656
Who is that?

00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:53.335
I'm tuning out.

00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:07.696
Isn't that my tune?

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:43.016
Driving this far for hotpot?

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:44.256
Is it worth it?

00:21:45.976 --> 00:21:48.016
For authentic nine-grid hotpot,

00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:49.815
I'd fly to Yuxia if needed.

00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:53.815
Ms. Lin won't let us travel far.

00:21:54.295 --> 00:21:55.815
I guess Licheng will do.

00:21:57.256 --> 00:21:58.656
With your weak stomach,

00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:00.335
you still crave spicy food.

00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:01.936
Listen to me.

00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:04.375
Let's just go to Yunxi.

00:22:04.976 --> 00:22:06.775
July and August bring fresh mushrooms.

00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:09.135
Mushroom soup base is nourishing.

00:22:09.575 --> 00:22:11.095
Might even hallucinate little fairies.

00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:19.456
Alright.

00:22:20.016 --> 00:22:20.775
Next time,

00:22:21.135 --> 00:22:22.775
I'll get approval
from Ms. Lin in advance.

00:22:22.896 --> 00:22:24.055
We can go together.

00:22:24.256 --> 00:22:25.216
You'll pay for flights.

00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:27.295
Let's take a real trip. Deal?

00:22:27.815 --> 00:22:28.256
Deal.

00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:29.575
Ling,

00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:30.976
any places you want to visit?

00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:34.615
Not sure.

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:39.656
Maybe somewhere by the sea.

00:22:40.976 --> 00:22:42.095
See that lake outside?

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:43.176
Looks endless too.

00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:44.575
It's no less than the sea.

00:22:45.456 --> 00:22:46.256
Just joking.

00:22:46.256 --> 00:22:46.976
(Welcome to Li Lake)

00:22:46.976 --> 00:22:47.615
What's that?

00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:49.176
Naya Scenic Area.

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:50.575
Right?

00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:51.615
North of Xicang,

00:22:51.976 --> 00:22:54.295
about 120 kilometers away.

00:22:54.335 --> 00:22:54.976
Roughly.

00:22:55.055 --> 00:22:55.855
Right?

00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:57.335
That beach is unmanaged.

00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:58.696
Part of the outer suburbs.

00:22:58.696 --> 00:23:00.736
You can set off fireworks there
during holidays.

00:23:01.216 --> 00:23:01.855
Awesome place.

00:23:04.815 --> 00:23:06.855
All your talking even made me thirsty.

00:23:06.855 --> 00:23:07.896
Let's get some drinks.

00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:09.216
Alright.

00:23:10.295 --> 00:23:11.016
Mi,

00:23:11.615 --> 00:23:12.815
why don't you come with me?

00:23:13.095 --> 00:23:13.976
If they go,

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:15.736
they'll pick terrible drinks.

00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:17.135
Then go.

00:23:17.135 --> 00:23:17.815
Makes sense.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.055
Give me your phone.

00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:22.736
Careful.

00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:28.016
Not bad.

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:29.016
Mi, let's go.

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:29.936
Come with me.

00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:33.216
Watch for cars. It's right there.

00:23:34.295 --> 00:23:35.335
Get me some.

00:23:35.815 --> 00:23:36.936
Then I'll stay put too.

00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:37.656
Okay.

00:23:39.775 --> 00:23:40.375
Let's go.

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:55.095
Sir.

00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:56.216
Pick your drink.

00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:58.496
Mi, choose what you want.

00:23:59.176 --> 00:23:59.896
Anything can do.

00:24:01.496 --> 00:24:03.375
Coffee or milk tea?

00:24:03.456 --> 00:24:04.055
Milk tea.

00:24:06.335 --> 00:24:07.535
I won't look back.

00:24:07.575 --> 00:24:08.936
Check what's behind us.

00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:11.295
Xiong Hei's car stopped.

00:24:12.456 --> 00:24:14.295
A white SUV has been tailing us
the whole way.

00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:15.375
It stopped too.

00:24:20.496 --> 00:24:21.656
Keep talking to me casually.

00:24:21.736 --> 00:24:22.656
Just pretend it.

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:32.736
(Coffee)
Something's on your face.

00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:33.335
Hurry.

00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:34.575
Let me get it off.

00:24:34.967 --> 00:24:36.658
(Yan Tuo)

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:43.335
I've reached Li Lake Highway.

00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:44.896
Licheng's just ahead. What now?

00:24:46.976 --> 00:24:49.496
(Xing Shen)
I said Licheng, not Li Lake.

00:24:49.896 --> 00:24:51.736
You're not there yet. No need to rush.

00:24:52.815 --> 00:24:53.936
White SUV.

00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:55.824
Should I read the license plate?

00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:58.815
I can't keep accommodating you.

00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:01.976
Keep up if you still want this meeting.

00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:06.016
They're coming.

00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:07.248
Meet me on the way.

00:25:14.135 --> 00:25:15.095
What's the deal here?

00:25:15.736 --> 00:25:16.456
Let's wait.

00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:18.496
See what tricks he's got left.

00:25:19.855 --> 00:25:20.496
A snail.

00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:21.775
See it?

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.535
This way. Let's sit over there.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.095
These cameras

00:25:57.496 --> 00:25:59.496
aren't just monitoring
greenhouse plants, are they?

00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:05.216
Let's see who's faster.

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.775
I'm here to find something shady.

00:26:13.216 --> 00:26:15.656
You should know what I mean.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.815
Are you curious

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:22.216
what this place is?

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.696
It's both the beginning

00:29:27.095 --> 00:29:28.375
and the end.

00:29:30.055 --> 00:29:31.416
It is both heaven

00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:33.896
and hell.

00:29:35.335 --> 00:29:37.575
But definitely not the mortal realm.

00:32:36.135 --> 00:32:36.775
Ms. Lin.

00:32:37.176 --> 00:32:38.896
Come back immediately. Trouble at home.

00:32:40.256 --> 00:32:40.815
Okay.

00:32:42.855 --> 00:32:43.976
There's trouble. Head home.

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:01.496
Got it.

00:33:02.095 --> 00:33:03.256
Home emergency. Turn around.

00:33:03.295 --> 00:33:03.976
Turn around?

00:33:04.456 --> 00:33:05.696
We're on the main road.

00:33:05.696 --> 00:33:07.095
Turn around now!

00:33:07.095 --> 00:33:07.775
Wait.

00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:08.615
Miss, my license...

00:33:08.615 --> 00:33:09.055
Shut up!

00:33:09.055 --> 00:33:09.696
I-I...

00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:11.216
Turn around!

00:33:19.575 --> 00:33:20.256
Are you okay?

00:33:21.135 --> 00:33:21.815
I'm fine.

00:33:22.216 --> 00:33:22.936
Stay put.

00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:24.855
I'll check outside.

00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:28.575
What happened?

00:33:30.055 --> 00:33:30.615
Go ahead.

00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:34.535
Look at this.

00:33:35.575 --> 00:33:36.815
Did your mom's ashes fall?

00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:38.615
Couldn't you signal and pull over?

00:33:38.696 --> 00:33:39.815
You had to slam the brakes?

00:33:39.896 --> 00:33:41.016
Can you talk properly?

00:33:41.016 --> 00:33:41.976
Insurance will cover it.

00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:43.176
You're bleeding.

00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:44.855
Lv Xian, what to do?

00:33:45.335 --> 00:33:46.736
A first-aid kit is in the back.

00:33:46.815 --> 00:33:47.456
Find it.

00:33:47.456 --> 00:33:47.815
Okay.

00:33:47.815 --> 00:33:48.775
We almost died there.

00:33:48.775 --> 00:33:49.295
Save that.

00:33:49.295 --> 00:33:49.936
Stop cursing me.

00:33:49.936 --> 00:33:51.330
You'll pay with your mom's ashes?

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.335
Do you know how to drive?

00:33:52.456 --> 00:33:53.295
Do you know?

00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:54.456
Was your dad on the road?

00:33:54.456 --> 00:33:55.016
Don't push me.

00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:55.656
Let me check.

00:33:55.736 --> 00:33:56.535
Don't push me.

00:33:56.656 --> 00:33:58.135
If I hadn't slammed the brakes...

00:33:58.135 --> 00:33:59.535
Move aside. Let me see.

00:33:59.615 --> 00:34:00.375
How are you?

00:34:00.416 --> 00:34:01.575
Your sudden braking...

00:34:01.575 --> 00:34:02.615
Let's talk this through.

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:04.615
He stopped. He braked hard.

00:34:04.855 --> 00:34:06.815
I got too close, and then you hit me.

00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:08.336
Why brake suddenly?

00:34:08.336 --> 00:34:09.215
We meet again.

00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:10.655
All this hassle.

00:34:10.655 --> 00:34:11.575
Are you testing me?

00:34:13.336 --> 00:34:14.175
Not exactly.

00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:17.575
So you've got other concerns.

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:18.896
To be blunt,

00:34:20.135 --> 00:34:21.215
I don't trust you.

00:34:24.856 --> 00:34:26.615
Luo already told you everything.

00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:28.175
I have no reason to lie to you.

00:34:29.896 --> 00:34:30.856
You...

00:34:30.856 --> 00:34:32.416
Sit still.

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.055
Let him treat this injury for you.

00:34:34.055 --> 00:34:36.296
Right. Small wound, big care.

00:34:36.336 --> 00:34:37.856
Wait, he should pay the compensation.

00:34:38.135 --> 00:34:38.896
Wait... No...

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:41.615
Do you truly have some blood feud
with the Earth Fiends?

00:34:42.095 --> 00:34:44.496
Or is it all just an elaborate lie
you've fabricated?

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.535
I have no way to verify it.

00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:48.896
Are you leading
the South Mountain Hunters?

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.215
So what if I am?

00:34:53.336 --> 00:34:54.416
Your guess was correct.

00:34:54.936 --> 00:34:56.215
I'm with the Earth Fiends.

00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:58.296
I meticulously
gained Luo's trust through lies.

00:34:58.376 --> 00:34:59.776
Then I caught a big fish like you.

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.376
We've got Jiang Baichuan already.

00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:03.215
If I just take out my phone

00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:06.095
and summon
the pre-positioned Earth Fiends

00:35:06.095 --> 00:35:07.135
to eliminate all of you,

00:35:08.695 --> 00:35:09.456
then the Hunters

00:35:09.456 --> 00:35:11.095
will completely
fall apart into disarray.

00:35:11.296 --> 00:35:12.896
No one could stop me then.

00:35:14.135 --> 00:35:14.655
What?

00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:17.055
Did I say something wrong?

00:35:17.055 --> 00:35:18.175
What about your car?

00:35:18.175 --> 00:35:19.175
What about my car?

00:35:19.175 --> 00:35:20.936
My front and...
Tell me, what about my car?

00:35:21.016 --> 00:35:22.695
I know you want to prove yourself,

00:35:23.735 --> 00:35:25.055
but for your own safety,

00:35:25.695 --> 00:35:27.615
you shouldn't make reckless jokes.

00:35:31.016 --> 00:35:33.055
I've held nothing back from the start.

00:35:34.695 --> 00:35:36.376
But cooperation requires mutual effort.

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.376
I hope you're not joking either.

00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:40.896
How did you get such long legs?

00:35:40.896 --> 00:35:41.615
If...

00:35:42.095 --> 00:35:42.856
It's your head.

00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:43.615
Wait.

00:35:44.296 --> 00:35:45.535
What exactly is Yan Tuo doing?

00:35:45.535 --> 00:35:46.376
What's the delay?

00:35:46.896 --> 00:35:48.016
Move aside. I must get down.

00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:50.615
Where are you going? Your head...

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.856
I haven't finished treating it.

00:35:51.976 --> 00:35:53.456
What about it? Just call the police.

00:35:53.456 --> 00:35:55.135
- Police? No. Give me the money now.
- Be careful.

00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:56.615
- I won't waste time with you.
- Tuo.

00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:58.376
Tuo, just pay them.

00:35:58.376 --> 00:35:59.296
Mi is still bleeding.

00:35:59.296 --> 00:36:00.016
I'll wait for you.

00:36:00.016 --> 00:36:01.296
When did you and Luo

00:36:01.296 --> 00:36:02.416
become so close?

00:36:03.496 --> 00:36:04.255
Ask her.

00:36:04.416 --> 00:36:05.215
Her answer is final.

00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.135
What do you mean?

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:07.055
You pushed me?

00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:08.735
Are you okay?

00:36:08.735 --> 00:36:09.456
It's settled.

00:36:09.456 --> 00:36:11.135
We'll go through insurance.

00:36:11.456 --> 00:36:13.055
Let's go through insurance.

00:36:13.776 --> 00:36:14.175
Careful.

00:36:14.175 --> 00:36:15.135
Come on. Let's go.

00:36:15.376 --> 00:36:16.655
Get in the car.

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:17.655
Mind your head.

00:36:18.535 --> 00:36:19.976
My car was stopped. You hit me.

00:36:22.255 --> 00:36:23.615
Sit still. Stop looking.

00:36:50.055 --> 00:36:50.655
Well?

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:52.215
Did you meet with Yan Tuo?

00:36:53.816 --> 00:36:55.655
He's barely qualified as a collaborator.

00:36:56.175 --> 00:36:56.856
That's good then.

00:36:57.976 --> 00:36:59.896
I've found something.
Let's talk in person.

00:37:00.095 --> 00:37:00.655
Okay.

00:37:11.336 --> 00:37:12.175
What a coincidence.

00:37:13.095 --> 00:37:14.095
Right.

00:37:14.255 --> 00:37:15.896
How could it be such a coincidence?

00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:19.016
When Yang Zheng and I
went to surveil them,

00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:20.695
the farm had an incident.

00:37:21.135 --> 00:37:23.535
The moment I mentioned family trouble,
a car crash happened.

00:37:24.296 --> 00:37:27.055
If Ms. Lin hadn't been here,
this place would've been looted clean.

00:37:28.095 --> 00:37:29.016
Ms. Lin,

00:37:29.296 --> 00:37:30.496
to be blunt,

00:37:31.615 --> 00:37:33.416
among the four people
traveling together,

00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:34.255
except for Feng Mi,

00:37:34.776 --> 00:37:36.095
none are trustworthy.

00:37:38.615 --> 00:37:39.376
Lv Xian

00:37:40.255 --> 00:37:41.655
isn't smart enough.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:44.896
Lin Ling

00:37:46.456 --> 00:37:47.936
isn't brave enough.

00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:51.856
So you mean?

00:38:04.776 --> 00:38:07.776
I truly hope my guess is wrong.

00:38:18.856 --> 00:38:19.936
You confronted her?

00:38:24.175 --> 00:38:25.976
I originally wanted to rescue Jiang

00:38:26.535 --> 00:38:28.376
but unexpectedly ran into Lin Xirou.

00:38:29.416 --> 00:38:30.496
But it should be fine.

00:38:31.016 --> 00:38:32.135
She didn't see my face.

00:38:34.456 --> 00:38:36.016
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

00:38:36.095 --> 00:38:37.296
Without the Mad Blade,

00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:40.016
how could we
fight humanoid Earth Fiends?

00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:42.496
Given what we know,

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:44.936
if we want to oppose the Earth Fiends,

00:38:45.296 --> 00:38:47.416
cooperating with Yan Tuo
is our only option.

00:38:49.296 --> 00:38:49.976
By the way,

00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:52.175
I found this at Lin Xirou's hideout.

00:38:53.215 --> 00:38:54.456
Looking like soil,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.055
it ignites upon contact with fire.

00:38:56.336 --> 00:38:57.776
Not sure what purpose it serves.

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:07.735
Alright, I'll investigate this.

00:39:35.095 --> 00:39:36.735
If we keep talking like this every day,

00:39:37.055 --> 00:39:38.535
can we bring Jiang back?

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.016
We don't even know where Jiang is.

00:39:41.255 --> 00:39:42.095
What else can we do?

00:39:42.655 --> 00:39:44.336
Are we really
trading Mad Blade for Jiang?

00:39:46.215 --> 00:39:47.175
Don't ask me.

00:39:47.175 --> 00:39:48.655
Ask Mad Blade.

00:39:49.776 --> 00:39:51.095
If it can save Jiang,

00:39:51.336 --> 00:39:52.095
I'm willing.

00:39:54.695 --> 00:39:55.936
When did you join us?

00:39:56.135 --> 00:39:57.175
Without a word.

00:39:57.215 --> 00:40:00.296
Leaving aside whether Earth Fiends
keep their promises.

00:40:01.456 --> 00:40:04.016
Even if we really trade Jiang back,

00:40:04.296 --> 00:40:05.215
when he finds out

00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:07.095
we traded Mad Blade for him,

00:40:08.575 --> 00:40:10.296
giving away the Hunters' trump card

00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:11.376
to Earth Fiends for free,

00:40:11.816 --> 00:40:13.496
what do you think he'll say?

00:40:13.695 --> 00:40:15.016
I don't know what he'd say,

00:40:15.055 --> 00:40:16.016
but I do know

00:40:16.135 --> 00:40:17.936
he'd smash this place with a hammer.

00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:20.255
So much power, with no outlet.

00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:22.175
So frustrating.

00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:29.776
I know

00:40:31.615 --> 00:40:33.095
you've been enduring this.

00:40:33.535 --> 00:40:35.135
Thank you for trusting me.

00:40:36.255 --> 00:40:37.695
No one has acted recklessly.

00:40:39.135 --> 00:40:40.016
But now,

00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:44.695
we don't have to wait anymore.

00:40:45.095 --> 00:40:46.735
This contains all of Lin Xirou's

00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:49.735
humanoid Earth Fiend allies
hidden across Yanguan.

00:40:53.376 --> 00:40:55.175
We can use this list

00:40:55.695 --> 00:40:56.976
to capture them all at once.

00:40:58.135 --> 00:40:59.535
Then use them as bargaining chips

00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:02.376
to negotiate Jiang's
and other Hunters' release

00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:03.615
from Lin Xirou.

00:41:03.976 --> 00:41:04.615
This way,

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.695
Mad Blade won't be exposed.

00:41:09.976 --> 00:41:10.816
Where did

00:41:12.615 --> 00:41:13.496
the list come from?

00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:17.615
I've had it for some time now.

00:41:18.575 --> 00:41:20.055
I waited to share it

00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:23.215
because I needed
to verify its reliability.

00:41:24.776 --> 00:41:25.936
I can guarantee that.

00:41:26.376 --> 00:41:27.135
It's trustworthy.
