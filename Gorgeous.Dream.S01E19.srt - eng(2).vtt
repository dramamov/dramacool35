=Gorgeous Dream=

00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:52.180
(Adapted from the novel
"The Charming Evil Consort")

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.020
=Episode 19=

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:56.912
(Charity Chest)

00:00:58.612 --> 00:00:59.652
Viceroy Qin

00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:01.493
is clearly here for Lan Mengyan.

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:03.413
He might ruin your plans.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.973
What's there to fear from a viceroy
driven by greed and lust?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.440
What I want to know is how
the investigation

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:15.850
into Chen Huanfeng's death is going.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.160
We've sent people several times.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.490
It was indeed an accident, a fall.

00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:22.053
Keep your eyes on Qin Moxiu.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.973
As for Lan Mengyan,
she's already stepped into the trap,

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:26.812
she won't be getting out.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.773
Yes, sir.

00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:13.493
Peace brings wealth!
Peace brings wealth!

00:02:50.853 --> 00:02:51.532
Someone's coming.

00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:53.132
Come on.

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:17.053
(That's Yin's doll.)

00:03:21.053 --> 00:03:23.493
Miss Lan, when I earn enough silver,
I'll come back for you.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200
(So she was being used
by the Jade Spy Bureau as well.)

00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:28.773
These belong to the homeless women.

00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:30.652
They're worthless junk.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:32.790
There's no need to sort it.

00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:33.853
Just throw it all out.

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:36.173
You're right.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:37.972
If there were anything of value,

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:39.773
they wouldn't have ended up here.

00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:42.212
What a bother.

00:03:42.412 --> 00:03:43.372
We even have to burn it.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.613
(To think Ruan is also
one of Zhu Lv's people.)

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.090
(The Jade Spy Bureau is far more vicious
than I imagined.)

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:27.332
Master,

00:04:28.173 --> 00:04:30.572
these are the latest ladies
to enter the bureau.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.138
(Lan Mengyan, from Hang City,
25, bold in love and hate,)

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.950
(naive, wealthy, easy to control.)

00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:35.692
Lady Lan

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:38.173
has been charmed by the Lovesick Charm

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.293
into donating everything she owned.

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:43.132
She's a widowed woman
with no family support

00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:44.293
and no value left.

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:47.332
Should we demote her?

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:50.572
Incidentally, the Mid-Moon Banquet

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:52.572
is short on tributes.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.692
She's the Lord's beloved.

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:57.173
If we discard her so easily,

00:04:57.932 --> 00:04:59.772
wouldn't that be a waste?

00:05:02.932 --> 00:05:04.213
Use her

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:07.293
to take the Lord's wealth as well.

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:09.853
Make it clean.

00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:11.332
Yes, sir.

00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:18.452
Sir.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:28.413
(It's him.)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.990
(The man who watched us die
in the Liu residence.)

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:32.093
(It was Zhu Lv!)

00:05:32.892 --> 00:05:33.372
Let's go.

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.372
How dare you trespass
into a restricted place!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.372
Are you all right?

00:06:02.173 --> 00:06:02.653
I'm fine.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.692
We shouldn't stay here.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.380
We have to go.

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:24.173
It's Ruan.

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:36.973
This fabric is used
for the ladies' headscarves.

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:39.653
Ruan's headscarf wasn't damaged.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:41.173
This isn't hers.

00:06:45.012 --> 00:06:46.252
Lock down the bureau at once.

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:49.173
Check every lady
whose headscarf is torn.

00:06:50.572 --> 00:06:51.012
Yes, sir.

00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:52.413
Move it!

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:53.252
Hurry!

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:53.973
Stop dawdling.

00:06:54.332 --> 00:06:55.132
Move, quickly!

00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:56.733
Hurry up!

00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:57.853
Faster!

00:06:59.892 --> 00:07:00.533
Keep moving!

00:07:07.692 --> 00:07:10.012
The bureau was infiltrated
by an intruder tonight.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.772
We are here
to take account of the ladies

00:07:12.053 --> 00:07:13.372
and confirm all are unharmed.

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:18.350
One is missing.

00:07:19.932 --> 00:07:20.533
Who's missing?

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:21.053
Lan Mengyan.

00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:23.252
Lady Ruan's roommate.

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:41.892
Lady Lan.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.213
Why were you absent
from the roll call just now?

00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:51.533
Ms. Tong,

00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:54.372
I had a terrible headache today.

00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:55.973
I took a calming draught

00:07:56.572 --> 00:07:57.853
and didn't hear the summons.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.653
Do you know

00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:02.932
your roommate, Lady Ruan,
was severely injured?

00:08:06.012 --> 00:08:06.973
Miss Ruan?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:10.293
Why?

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:12.053
It wasn't an accident.

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:13.932
Someone attacked her.

00:08:15.613 --> 00:08:16.413
Attacked?

00:08:18.293 --> 00:08:19.533
You mean

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:21.853
someone wanted her dead?

00:08:23.332 --> 00:08:23.892
Yes.

00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:26.610
A trespasser slipped into the bureau.

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:31.613
Where's your headscarf?

00:08:34.412 --> 00:08:35.973
Let me see it.

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:41.660
Instructor Tong,

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.690
Director Zhu was attacked.

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:50.693
(An assassination.)

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.190
(He must be drawing
their eyes away from me.)

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.412
(That hidden weapon was poisoned.)

00:09:35.973 --> 00:09:36.772
Search this room.

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:46.493
You dare barge into my quarters?

00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:47.613
Get out!

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:49.252
Yes, sir.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.172
Let's go.

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:51.973
Close the door.

00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:52.933
Yes, sir.

00:10:00.453 --> 00:10:01.012
Sit down.

00:10:04.493 --> 00:10:05.213
I'm fine.

00:10:05.532 --> 00:10:06.333
You should go back.

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:08.213
That wound,
you got it earlier saving me…

00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:09.333
It's nothing.

00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:14.772
What is it?

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.660
Are you still thinking
about killing Zhu Lv right now?

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:19.613
No.

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:21.573
I'm thinking

00:10:22.532 --> 00:10:23.652
the one behind him

00:10:24.813 --> 00:10:25.933
must be someone else.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.573
Do you remember what we overheard
in the hidden chamber?

00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:30.693
Master,

00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:32.892
we've counted all the notes.

00:10:33.372 --> 00:10:36.813
The funds
for the Mid-Moon Banquet are ready.

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:37.733
Good.

00:10:38.652 --> 00:10:40.652
Master He must be pleased.

00:10:41.453 --> 00:10:41.892
Right.

00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:43.973
Have you found a replacement

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.380
for the Liu family's position?

00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:47.292
I was just about to report.

00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:49.190
The Chen family of Anzhou

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:52.693
is willing to contribute
an extra thousand taels each month,

00:10:52.973 --> 00:10:54.252
and as ordered,

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.400
they've already beaten
their womenfolk to death

00:10:56.973 --> 00:10:57.933
and announced

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.590
to the public that they died
preserving their chastity.

00:11:01.132 --> 00:11:01.652
Good.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:03.213
I'll submit a request

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.733
for a Martyr Maiden Arch,

00:11:05.052 --> 00:11:08.213
and appoint the Chen family head
as the Prefectural Judge of Anzhou.

00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:11.933
This tangled network behind Zhu Lv,

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:14.333
the so-called Master He

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.412
must be the one at the center.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.890
He's tied to the case
of the Seven Martyr Heroines

00:11:19.093 --> 00:11:20.132
for sure.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:26.532
You know this Master He?

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.190
In court, the only one
addressed as Master He

00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:32.213
is He Chen, the State Preceptor.

00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:34.333
He's both State Preceptor

00:11:34.453 --> 00:11:35.652
and commander of the armies.

00:11:36.372 --> 00:11:37.333
His influence is such

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.372
that even His Majesty
regards him with caution.

00:11:43.613 --> 00:11:44.530
I suppose the grand lie

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.573
about raising troops
with the Dongzhu pearls

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:47.613
came from his hand.
