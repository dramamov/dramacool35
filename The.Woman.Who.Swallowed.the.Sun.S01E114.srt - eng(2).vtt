00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.410
(Episode 114)

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.910
What do you think you're doing?
Are you crazy?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.650
Don't you know Se Ri has allergies?
Are you trying to kill her?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.120
I know Se Ri better than you do.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.020
Cut it out!

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.320
Do you want her to end up in the ER?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.690
Are you trying to kill her or something?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.800
I don't have any allergies.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.860
So naturally,
she shouldn't have any either.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.670
We share the same flesh and blood.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Snap out of it!

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.380
Go on upstairs.
Take your allergy medicine, just in case.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.220
You sound like her mom.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.920
I am her mom.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.390
No one can justify
what you're doing right now.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.000
You're a grown woman. How can you
lose control and take it out on a child?

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.370
And you call yourself her sister?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.900
You wouldn't even treat
a stranger this way.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.870
Instead of taking it out on a child,
get your own emotions in check.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.240
Before you do something you'll regret.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.560
Se Ri, are you okay?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.930
You're not breaking out in a rash,
are you?

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.560
Thank goodness.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.070
I was so worried.
I was afraid you'd have to go to the ER.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.600
What's wrong with Kyung Chae?
She's acting like she's lost her mind.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.810
She knows I have a bad reaction
to certain foods I can't eat.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.110
It's not like this is a new thing.
So why is she acting like this suddenly?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.380
At times like this,
Kyung Chae feels like a total stranger.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.120
I don't have to be just like her, do I?

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.790
I'm her half-sister,
so I probably take after my own mom.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.060
It's from either my dad's side
or my mom's.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.970
But why does she have to rub it
in my face like this?

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.500
Is it because I'm the child
Dad had from an affair?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.210
Is it a crime to take after my own mother?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.910
I'm the only one who can't eat things
my brother and sisters enjoy,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.290
and the longer I live with them,
the more I see how different I am.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.050
Does she think that's been easy for me?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.590
Even Soo Jung, who’s also
an illegitimate child just like me,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.830
has some family resemblance.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.330
But I have none.
You have no idea how lonely I've been.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.070
But I put up with it
because Kyung Chae was so kind to me.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.310
But if she suddenly turns on me like that,
what am I supposed to do?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.710
I want to be a part of this family
more than anything.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.270
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.340
Kyung Chae!

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.330
Here’s the contract
that has been reviewed recently.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.160
Legal has already given its approval.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.100
What do I do now?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.770
What in the world am I supposed to do?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.240
Just bury it.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.610
You've lived with it buried
for the last 20 years.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.640
If it's to your advantage,
then that's what you have to do.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.180
Isn't that the way you handle things,
Min Kyung Chae?

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.780
More than truth or facts,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.380
you calculate which situation
is to your advantage...

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.650
and make your move
based on what you'll gain.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.420
If you were going to tell me to bury it,
you shouldn't have brought it up at all.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.230
What exactly do you know?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.900
So what happens
when Pandora's box is opened?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.600
Is there a more terrifying truth
hidden inside?

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.640
I thought I told you to ask
when you're sure you can handle it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.970
Then why did you tell me?

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.310
To watch me get destroyed?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.540
You'd fall apart over this?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.910
For 20 years, I've seen her
as my daughter.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.350
You think I wouldn't fall apart?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.280
Could you honestly say you wouldn't?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280
Then again...

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.290
What would you know...

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.620
about a mother's love or compassion?

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.660
You're barely even human.
What could you possibly understand?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.460
Did you treat me like your hound...

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.930
because I'm not human enough?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.100
It was fine when you used me for games,
but I can't do the same to you?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.440
You get to betray me,
but I can't do the same to you?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.010
So you wanted me to get a taste
of my own medicine?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.180
Is that why you told me the cruel truth?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.410
Cruel?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.280
You haven't even had a real taste yet.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.080
You have no idea what's truly cruel.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.390
(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.000
Why are you just moping here?
Aren't you going to your part-time job?

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.710
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.480
Now that I look closer, you look awful.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.810
My goodness, what happened overnight?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.210
Did something happen last night?

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.620
Kyung Chae...

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.090
got angry at me for not being like her.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.520
She was acting so weird yesterday.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.390
Anyone who saw her would've thought
she was crazy.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.960
Ms. Kyung Chae said that?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.870
It's not like it's a new thing
that I don't resemble my family.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.500
It's been stressing me out
since I was a kid.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.110
Anyone can tell Soo Jung is a Min,
but not me.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.380
Honestly, that's why I've always acted out
and gotten into trouble.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.480
Is that really why?

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.380
Of course. I'm not blind.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.650
I know I don't look like my dad,
or like my brother or Kyung Chae.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.650
How could I be okay with that?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.520
That's why I could never
get my act together.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.030
Hey, we need to get going.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.370
Don't say anything else.
We're just there to see what Dad wants.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.640
I know that.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.110
There's no way the shareholders' meeting
is happening now,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.710
so we just need to make it look like
we're on Dad's side.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.110
I get it, okay?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.920
Oh, Father!

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.390
You're really awake. Why did you...

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.020
No, that's not what I meant.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.390
You should've woken up much sooner.
We were so worried about you.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.530
I was so furious about
Kyung Chae moving you behind our backs.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.970
How did you get in here?
I told them not to let just anyone in.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.200
We pleaded.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.870
We said we weren't just anyone
and had something to hear from you.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.510
What is it you want to hear from me?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.340
You want to hear me say
we should get rid of Lucia...

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.080
and make Kyung Chae chairman?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.810
So you two are on Kyung Chae's side?
You want her out too?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.220
Of course not. We wouldn't be here then.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.320
We came for the exact opposite reason.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.420
You're awake and perfectly fine now.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.390
You wouldn't kick Lucia out, would you?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.320
And make Kyung Chae chairman?
Are you kidding?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.430
Not after what she did to you.
How could she dare?

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.000
If that's how you feel,
tell Kyung Chae to call off...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.900
the shareholders' meeting
and all that other nonsense.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.070
Tell her not to make me any angrier.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.400
Hey.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.580
Looks like Father is furious
with Kyung Chae.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.810
See?
She still thinks she can pull this off.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.380
That was all just talk
from before Dad woke up.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.780
So what's Kyung Chae going to do?
All that for nothing.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.780
Exactly. If it succeeds,
it's a revolution.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.750
If it fails, it's a coup.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.690
Kyung Chae failed.
And Lucia just got incredibly lucky.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.690
If the shareholders' meeting
had been held,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.630
she would've been fired for sure.

(Mingang Distribution)

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.280
Hey, I have a message from Father.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.410
- What is it?
- He said to cancel that nonsense meeting.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.820
If you keep up this ridiculous nonsense
about dismissing Lucia,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.250
you're going to be in serious trouble.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920
Those were his words.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.520
Seriously, you should've toned it down.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.530
Your temper is why nothing works out.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.030
And here I was getting my hopes up
for nothing.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.930
I really thought you'd kick her out
and take over as chairman.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.870
I really got ahead of myself.
Me, a director? As if.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.610
By the way,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.040
didn't you say Dad and that woman
were getting a divorce?

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.050
Why ask? That fell through, too.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.350
Of course.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.450
Is anything ever going to go right?

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.390
Hey, what's with her?

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.960
- She's completely zoned out.
- I know, right?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.830
Any other time,
she'd be throwing a massive fit right now.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.200
It's like something else is
on her mind, right?

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.770
Like something more important came up?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.140
What could be more important
than this right now?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.780
I told you to stay at your desk.
Everyone else is out in the field.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.180
Who's supposed to watch the office?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.220
I had a good reason to leave.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.050
And what could possibly be so important
that you had to leave?

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.260
My father woke up.
As his son, should I have just ignored it?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.620
You went to see the chairman?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.330
Father wants the shareholders' meeting
called off.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.800
It looked like he'll be discharged
and back at work very soon.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.330
If that happens,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.770
what's going to happen to Lucia?

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.340
What do you think will happen?
If my father returns as the chairman,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.970
Lucia will go back to being CEO,
and Kyung Chae will be forced out.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.940
Soo Jung keeps her director position,
and as for me,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.310
I'm just...

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.810
Darn it.

Where are you?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.070
Why do you care where I am?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.470
Get to my office right now.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.380
We need to talk.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.180
That's too bad.
I'm afraid I'm too busy right now.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.850
I'll call you later when I'm free.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.660
I need to ask you something.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.800
And I need you to be honest with me.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.070
I'm just so popular today, aren't I?

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.340
Everyone's calling for me left and right.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.740
Whatever it is, go ask Moon Tae Kyung,
your last man.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.950
What would a ghost from your past
like me know?

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.620
Did you by any chance...

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.150
tell Min Kyung Chae that Se Ri wasn't...

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.690
her biological daughter?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360
And what if I did?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.700
Are you crazy?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.200
How could you tell her that?

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.270
Do you have any idea
what Kyung Chae did to Se Ri yesterday?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.010
At this rate, I'm worried
she's going to destroy Se Ri.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.710
She raised her as her own for 20 years,
only to find out she's not.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.580
Do you really think
she's in her right mind right now?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.080
That's why I told you
that you, me, and Se Ri...

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.850
should start over for real.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.250
I said we could take over Mingang,
and that we should give it our all.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.490
When I said we could be
a real owner family,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.160
with my bloodline, not the Mins,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.160
you're the one who threw it all away.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.830
You ruined everything, and now what?

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.360
You're saying this is all my fault?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.860
Hey, Baek Sul Hee.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.970
If you'd committed, we could've been set
for the rest of our lives.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.740
You're the one who chose the hard path.
Got it?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.210
You didn't have to tell her everything!

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.610
Are you even human?

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.980
You don't deserve to be Se Ri's father.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.010
I don't need any of that anymore.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.180
That only mattered when Se Ri was the heir
to Mingang Distribution.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.620
You said...

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.290
you'd never let Se Ri be the chairman
of Mingang Distribution, right?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.230
Then I have no use for her either.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.860
I only needed her as long as she was
going to be the owner of Mingang.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.700
Tae Kyung was right.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.800
You don't deserve a family.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.000
You'll live your whole life alone,
and you'll die alone.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.240
If you keep pushing my buttons,

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.840
I might just spill
who Se Ri was switched with...

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.050
and who her mother is.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.750
I'm holding back for now,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.350
but if you keep pushing me,
I can't say what I'll do.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760
Seriously!

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.070
I don't know what to do.
Min Kyung Chae already knows.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.800
Kim Sun Jae is really a lost cause.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.370
I hoped it wasn't true.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.380
Frankly, knowing him, it's a miracle
he hasn't told her everything already.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.950
That won't last long.
Once he thinks it's really over for him,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.650
he's the type who'll confess who I am
and take everyone down with him.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.720
Then we need to make our move
before Kim Sun Jae blows everything up.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.260
Canceling the shareholders' meeting
is just a temporary fix, after all.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.430
By the way,

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.330
were you followed
by anyone suspicious today?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.530
I'd be lucky if I weren't.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.970
They're the men
Chairman Min Doo Sik hired.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.500
They're not going to give up that easily.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.940
I managed to lose them and just got home.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.040
I was worried about the slush fund ledger
in my room.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.590
You should eat something with that.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.160
You skipped dinner
and have just been drinking.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.370
What's gotten into you?

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.140
What gave you the right
to interfere in my life?

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.780
You must have enjoyed it.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.280
Watching me fawn over a child
that wasn't even mine.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.820
I already told you.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.290
If I were in the same situation,
I'd do it all over again.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.300
Do you want me to say it again?

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.830
If the same situation happened
10 or 100 times,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.270
I'd still switch the babies!

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.570
If it meant...

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.110
saving you, Ms. Kyung Chae,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.880
I'll never regret what I did.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.480
I can always accept my punishment later.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.160
What happened...

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.130
to the baby from back then?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.230
She stopped breathing.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.070
I confirmed it myself.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.400
Kyung Chae is crying?
I wonder what happened.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.000
What? Kyung Chae is crying? Why?

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.530
I don't know.
She was sobbing in Manager Gong's arms.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.470
I wonder if that's why.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.610
Father said he'd make Kyung Chae pay
if she had to fire our stepmother.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.310
Look how she tanked
the shareholders' meeting.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.180
I bet there'll be an official document
on it tomorrow.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.780
But why isn't your father coming home?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.580
Does he prefer being at the hospital?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.520
No, it's just less drama for him there.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.120
Anyway, Kyung Chae really got
on Father's bad side this time.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.860
She’s been acting in ways
that upset Father for a while now.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.130
And it was bound to blow up
in her face eventually.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.230
Kyung Chae's pulled
too many stunts on Father.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.270
Still, for Kyung Chae
to cry over something like that?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.570
And in Manager Gong's arms?
It doesn't make any sense.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.170
Unless it could be about that other thing.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.580
Come on, you know,
I told you about last time.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.980
What, that again?
That Se Ri is Kyung Chae's daughter?

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.250
And that they were switched at birth?

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.020
Darling, you've been watching
too many soap operas.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.650
Unbelievable.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.090
Wait. If the shareholders' meeting is off,
and your stepmother doesn't get fired,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.530
what does that mean for you?

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.400
- What about your promotion to director?
- What do you think?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.700
It's dead in the water.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.270
Darn it.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.810
Tae Joo, long time no see.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.010
- How have you been?
- I'm good. You?

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.450
You know how it is.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.480
What brings you here at this hour?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.060
I thought you should be aware
of something, Madam Jang.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.460
The shareholders' meeting
I mentioned before...

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.030
has been called off.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.500
Good for you.
That's good news for you, isn't it?

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.440
Now you can keep lining your pockets
without a care in the world.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.070
You've got Min Doo Sik
wrapped around your little finger.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.180
- Madam Jang.
- The heavens must be on your side.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.410
Or maybe not?
Or maybe it's Mi So helping you?

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.750
No, that's not it.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.820
You and Mi So don't share a drop of blood.
That doesn't make any sense, does it?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.350
Min Kyung Chae...

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.390
also found out that Se Ri
isn't her biological daughter.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.300
So now she'll understand
why you turned your back on her.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.760
And? So what?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.870
You came all this way
just to tell me that?

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.170
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to get mixed up with you anymore.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.540
Fine. Call it a cruel twist of fate
or what have you,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.880
but your daughter and my granddaughter
were switched.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.850
Publicly, it may have been your daughter
who died,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.580
but it was actually my granddaughter
who passed.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.120
She threw her fragile self off a rooftop.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.660
And when you really think about it,

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.390
wasn't it all because of your fault?

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.730
- Madam Jang.
- That's why I say this.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.900
It's not like she did it on purpose,
and it's not like you put her up to it,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.530
so I'm saying I'll let it go!

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.270
So don't come here
and make this harder on me.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.970
I'm barely holding on as it is.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.610
I came because I want us to...

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.150
go back to how things were.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.720
I know it's difficult for you,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.050
but I'm asking you to forgive me...

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.120
and take me back.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.060
You've made a mistake coming here.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.400
No, you really shouldn't have come at all.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.100
From now on,
I don't care what happens to you...

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.370
with the Min family.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.040
Even if you drop dead
right in front of me,

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.710
I'll look the other way.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.830
So, Madam Jang is refusing
to take you back?

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.200
It must be too painful for her
when she thinks of Mi So.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.370
And it won't be easy for her
to stop blaming Se Ri.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.210
Still, she's going to end it like this?
After all you two have been through?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.210
I know blood ties are important,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680
but come on.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.050
I never took Madam Jang
for that kind of person.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.110
Especially after I pleaded with her.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.050
She doted on Se Ri,
thinking she carried her son's blood.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.790
Now that things are different,
it must be hard for her to accept.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.290
Times like these really confuse me.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.990
Take Mi So and Yeon Ah, for example.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.000
They aren't your blood relatives,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.600
but those two...

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.440
mean more to you than anyone.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.700
That's right.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.940
I believe the bonds you choose
can be thicker than blood.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.880
But that's just how I feel.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.210
I can't force others to feel the same way.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.920
Exactly.
And that's what makes this so upsetting.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.490
Because I can actually understand
where she's coming from.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.630
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.660
Please, take Lucia back.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.700
You can't be at peace
with this either, Mother.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.940
Tae Joo, you'll understand
when you have a child of your own one day.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.340
Just how powerful blood ties can be.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.740
By that logic,

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.480
I don't share a drop of your blood,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.280
so it must seem ridiculous
for me to call you "Mother."

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.320
Why must you be so cynical?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.650
I thought you were different, Mother.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.460
When I was barely surviving
on the streets of New York,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.590
you were the only one
who reached out to me...

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.600
to treat me like a human being.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.970
More than anyone else,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.300
you're the one who taught me
that some bonds are thicker than blood.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.920
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.660
When you get that serious look,
it can only be one of two things.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.760
Money or women.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.900
Both. Darn it.
I'm thinking about our in-law.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.830
I hear he's completely lucid again.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.040
We have to think about
what's going to happen next.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:18.010
Will he go back to being chairman,
or let his young wife keep the job?

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.110
You know how greedy that man is.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.480
He's not the type to just give up
the chairman's seat.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.680
I don't know. A near-death experience
can change a person.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.550
He went to death's door and back.
You think he's going to be the same?

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.360
Oh, please. A leopard
doesn't change its spots.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.260
Anyway, forget that.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.690
You're still holding on
to your shares, right?

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:41.160
My dear wife, for the thousandth time,
yes, I still have them.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.900
Since we were told that
those shares were needed,

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.270
I bet that household is
headed for trouble.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.770
What are you, a psychic?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.010
Go set up a booth. Stop meddling
in things you don't understand.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.780
How is it meddling
when Ja Kyung and Ji Seop are involved?

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.850
- Answer your phone.
- Gosh.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.760
Ja Kyung! What's going on?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.930
So what does this mean for Ji Seop?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.660
Good grief, it's such a struggle
to get that director position.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.570
All right, I'll tell your dad.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.470
- Goodness.
- What did Ja Kyung say?

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.040
She said the shareholders' meeting
or whatever got canceled,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.340
so Ji Seop's promotion is out the window.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.180
It was? The shareholders' meeting
was called off?

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.050
Well, now.
Why do you look so happy to hear that?

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.390
You're up to something.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.620
I live so I can look to the heavens
without a single shred of shame.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.800
I'm pained by even a breeze in the leaves.
I love all things destined to fade.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.900
- Yang Mal Sook, Ja Kyung, and Stella.
- What?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.100
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.480
So the shareholders' meeting
is completely off, right?

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.880
Get out.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.280
I can't even think about that right now.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.220
This isn't like you. What's with you?

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.020
You'll be in danger if this happens.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.520
I know it's weird for me
to be worried about you,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.460
but if Dad comes back, even tomorrow,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.330
this position will go back
to its original owner, that woman.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.560
And you'll be forced out of the company.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.300
I know. You don't have to spell it out.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.970
You know that,
and you're still acting this way?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.800
What's with you? You're spaced out!

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.670
I said get out!

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.610
You called for me?

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.850
Seriously, what's Kyung Chae's deal?

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.050
She doesn't seem to care about
the shareholders' meeting at all.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.590
You think so?

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.460
Either something bigger happened,
or she's just lost in her own thoughts.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.160
She isn't acting like this
because we're dating, is she?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.000

(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.020
What brings you here at this hour?

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.320
I told you to just bury the past
and live on.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.590
Where is Se Ri?

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.790
She's in her room.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.230
She even skipped her part-time job
and hasn't come out of her room.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.840
What are you doing here at this time?

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.650
I'm so sorry.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.490
I never should have treated you
that way the other night.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.020
It was all my fault.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.190
Is that why you're here?
To apologize to me?

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.300
Yes.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.230
Is that all?

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.100
It's okay.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.400
I was a little shocked at first,

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.440
but I just figured you were
under an insane amount of stress...

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.540
at work lately.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.510
You thought that?

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.010
You have a big heart.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.750
- Understanding me and everything.
- If I don't, who will?

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.360
Honestly, there are times
you got on my nerves,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.890
but there were way more good times.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.560
When no one else treated me like a person,
you were the only one who cared for me.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.830
You were always someone I could count on,

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.100
and you were like a mother to me.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740
A mother?

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.810
A mom.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:50.010
When I was little, I used to wish
that you were my real mom.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.680
I actually thought that sometimes.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.950
You really thought that?

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.960
Is something wrong, Kyung Chae?

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.900
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.180
How many times do I have to tell you
to stake out in front of the company...

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.540
and ambush him?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.280
That punk is quicker than he looks,
and he's a tough fighter.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.820
Then get more men!
I don't care how much it costs.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.860
If you fail again, it'll be your funeral.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.800
You'd better take out
Moon Tae Kyung today.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.520
Am I too paranoid?
