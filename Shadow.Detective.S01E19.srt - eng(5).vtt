Is this it?

This contains the business record
of Skylark Company

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.920
over the years

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.920
and a list of all their foreign clients.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.590
With this,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.930
we can become the second Skylark Company

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.110
in Shanghai.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840

[Maintain Law and Discipline]

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.470
The area around Shop No. 7 is located

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.310
at the junction of various concessions.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.840
Gang forces gather here,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280
making governance quite difficult.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.480
It's a place the police station avoids.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.520
Sasaki Jiro has been active here

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.770
for many years,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.790
yet very few have seen his true face.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.170
This kind of caution is not common.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.590
This place has a complex environment
and tight security,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.030
like a city within a city.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.970
Getting in is not easy.
Getting out is even harder.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.950
And the slightest misstep

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.680
can bring fatal consequences.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.750
Then how do we get in?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.120
We can start with Chen Jinpeng.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.680
Last time at Shihua Hotel,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.800
he was the one who met with Sasaki Jiro.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.270
My father and I have met him

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.290
at social events.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.830
He's quite interesting.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.530
He owns a dog racing track.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.190
Back when dog racing was popular,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.430
he single-handedly

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.320
managed all the dog racing
in the International Settlement.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.260
As far as I know, around the Xinwei year,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.720
the International Settlement
had already banned dog racing.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.520
How's his dog racing track doing?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.860
It seems it's still operating.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.930
Still operating?

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.030
If it's still operating now,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.190
isn't that strange?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.680
Why?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.680
Raising racing dogs is different
from raising ordinary dogs.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.810
They often

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.150
develop various physical problems

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.780
due to years of high-intensity racing,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.780
so the daily expenses are not small.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.560
When there are races,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.560
the main income for the dog racing track

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.620
comes from ticket sales and betting.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.360
After the ban,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.380
where did their income come from?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.370
Such a large sum of money...

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.130
Where did Chen Jinpeng get it?

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.150
The reason he met with Sasaki Jiro

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.190
is they

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.800
have large, shady financial dealings.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.190
Looks like
we need to pay Chen Jinpeng a visit.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.070
I haven't been here for a long time.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.800
This place used to be bustling,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.120
but now it's become so desolate.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.480
Shen Garden and Ming Garden

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.070
have been closed for so long.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.360
It's unbelievable

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.220
that this place is still open.

He's fine.

There's something
I'd like to ask you about.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.960
We are investigating a man

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.160
named Sasaki Jiro.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.150
You seem to know him well.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.910
Sasaki Jiro?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.050
We're not close.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.480
What's wrong?

Sasaki Jiro.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.360
He donated a lot of money to you.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.159
That's right.

Don't try to lecture me.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.040
I don't care.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.040
I only care if my dogs can survive.

There's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.830
He invested so much money in you.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.690
He must want something in return.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.630
That dog

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.630
came back from his place, right?

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.940
They are running underground dog racing?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.520
You're not helping them.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.310
You're harming them.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.510
But what can I do?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.950
They need to eat.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.680
I need to eat too.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.870
I'll help you.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.500
I'll help you raise funds.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.380
What's wrong?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.400
I have many channels and wide connections.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.970
I happen to know an editor

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.430
who has long been dedicated
to animal protection.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.290
He can help you.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.600
But,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.240
like I said,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.890
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.240
Every time he wants dogs from me,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.850
he'd arrange to meet me at Shihua Hotel

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.730
and tell me which ones he wants.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.800
So,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.060
there'll be a new round of dog races soon.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.200
How did you know?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.400
Where do they hold the races?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.940

Here to pick up the dogs?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.430
Yes.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.510
Do you need so many people?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.390
The dogs from last time

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.630
were all personally chosen by Mr. Sasaki,
very wild.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.980
I can't handle them alone.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.010
Alright, enough talk.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.000
Hurry up and go in.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.430
Get the dogs and come out quickly.

Let's go.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.270
I'll go in first.

You keep watch here.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.860
If anything happens, run immediately.

Official kiln bowls.

The Fuxi and Nuwa Painting.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.320
But it's only half of it.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.120
Just half?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.050
Half of the Fuxi and Nuwa Painting.

Who's there?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.080
Stop right there!

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.050
What are you doing here?

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.720
Bro, I'm here to deliver dogs.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.350
I got separated from my boss.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.130

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.270
Yes.

Don't wander around.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.200
Okay, okay.

here?

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.960
Begging for mercy?
Trying to intimidate me?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.220
Or do you think
I won't do anything to you?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.600
What can I do?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.050
Captain,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.870
I'm here
to discuss collaboration with you.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.870
Collaboration?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.500
We've competed under Zhuo Chaoxiong

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.910
for so many years.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.670
I smuggle goods, you traffic people.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.030
Now he's dead.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.570
Either you or I will take his position.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.910
Tell me how we can possibly collaborate.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.120
You Japanese only know competing

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.360
and killing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.910
Neither of us can

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.360
take over Zhuo Chaoxiong's business alone.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.390
He's dead,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.720
but Skylark Company

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.120
hasn't filled his position yet.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.980
Do you know why?

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.290
They are watching the tigers fight.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.630
If we fight to the death,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720
who would benefit from that?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.280
Then...

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.820
I'll stay calm.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.080
You stay calm too.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.240
We'll wait and see what happens.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.360
Who's there?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.400
What are you doing here?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.680
Stop! Don't run!

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.790
Stop! Don't run!

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.550
Stop!

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.520
Get in the car!

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.510
After them!

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.510
Stop! Stop!

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.240
-Stop!
-Stop chasing!

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.080
I didn't find

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.480
any useful information.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.390
I only know they have

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.030
many antiques and cultural relics.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.200
And they have...

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.010
the Fuxi and Nuwa Painting.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.510
He only has half of it.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.840
The Fuxi and Nuwa Painting?

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.080
I've seen it at Director Huo's place.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.960
I heard the Fuxi half was stolen.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.940
The remaining Nuwa half
is extremely precious.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.000
I... I overheard something.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.780
Didn't I tell you to wait for me there?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.510
I saw someone in the room next door.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.550
And

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.910
I was worried I might miss

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.440
some useful information,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.150
so I went to take a look.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.850
I think I heard Sasaki talking.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.910
Did you see him?

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.910
Sasaki was talking to another person.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.790
I didn't see clearly
what that person looked like.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.620
I only heard Sasaki call that person

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.390
Butcher.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.670
That person called Sasaki Captain.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.720
Butcher and Captain?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.390
And Butcher's voice

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.270
sounded really familiar.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.960
I feel like
I've heard it somewhere before.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.490
Heard it somewhere before?

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.480
Then...

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.200
have you remembered who it was?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.910
I tried,

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.750
but I couldn't remember.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.440
In short, they belong to the same gang.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.120
They're both Zhuo Chaoxiong's men.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.240
They just play different roles.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.670
One handles smuggled goods,
the other handles human trafficking.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.800
I understand what smuggled goods are.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.000
Human trafficking?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.540
Could human trafficking
be related to the case from back then?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.270
This might be

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.480
the target we've been looking for.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.440
From their conversation,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.000
after Zhuo Chaoxiong's death,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.200
they have been fighting internally,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.960
trying to take over each other's business

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.840
and take Zhuo Chaoxiong's position.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.150
But this time, Butcher

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.630
took the initiative to reconcile,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.080
wanting to collaborate with Sasaki.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.720
Then...

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.700
did he say anything...

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.260
about the gang behind them?

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.630
The gang is called Skylark Company.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.030
After Zhuo Chaoxiong died,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.440
Skylark Company still hasn't decided

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.300
who will succeed Zhuo Chaoxiong.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.840
So everyone is waiting for their contact.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.750
If Skylark Company hasn't decided

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.320
who will succeed Zhuo Chaoxiong,

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.790
perhaps this is advantageous for us.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.590
That's right.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.410
We must seize the opportunity now

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.710
and find a chance to get close to Sasaki,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.320
only then can we
uncover Butcher's identity.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.910
Two liang of steamed buns, please.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.670
Okay, okay.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.670
Just a moment.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.480
Here you are.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.030
Thank you.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.360
Take them and take care.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.360
Lu Yizhen.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.620
Just stay right there.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.750
Who are you?

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.960
You don't need to know who I am.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.120
You only need to know

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.120
that I have something you want.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.690
You want to make a deal with me?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.330
I want to give you a gift.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.030
Why?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.770
I don't want you to waste your time.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.700
It's better for everyone this way.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.780
You and I share the same enemy?

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.570
You're Yang Xiaolin?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.270
Are you confident?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.240
Director Huo,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.150
actually,

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.000
we've already done some reconnaissance.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.760
We already know the basic situation.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.400
As long as we can infiltrate,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.750
we'll have a chance.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.750
Maybe we can even solve

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.280
the old case from back then.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.840
So you're not confident.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.070
Director Huo,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.840
now is the best chance,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.320
and it might be our only chance.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.960
Exactly.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.720
The child abductions from back then,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.360
the mysterious killer in the prison,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.870
the massacre at Zhuo Chaoxiong's house,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.960
and many more cases are all related

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.910
to Skylark Company behind this.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.740
Director Huo,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.510
Zhuo Chaoxiong is dead now.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.200
His subordinates

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.650
are all waiting for instructions
from Skylark Company.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.290
If we can just infiltrate,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.180
we might be able to catch them all.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.160
It might work,

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.480
but how will you infiltrate?

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.480
We've already...

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.550
thought of a method.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:11.770
Don't...

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.310
even think about using this.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.750
This is important physical evidence.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.270
Inspector Zhu just solved that case.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.000
This Fuxi and Nuwa Painting—

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.930
even if only the Nuwa part remains,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.550
it must be returned

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.349
to its rightful owner.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.950
Director Huo, Director Huo.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.430
Two days. Just 2 days.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.140
I promise to return it intact.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.270
Yes.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.880
Fine then.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.140
I didn't see anything.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.020
We're leaving.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.220
The interior of Shop No. 7

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.550
is like a sparrow's innards:

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.070
small but complete.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.440
This is where we need to enter.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.030
This is the east wing
where Sasaki meets with people.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.340
[Shop No. 7]

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.140
They hold a dog race every month,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.840
and a group of people would also come here
to buy and sell antiques.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.880
We will use this opportunity

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.140
to get close to Sasaki.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.160
We will contact him and enter the shop

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.360
under the pretext of selling antiques.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.510
Director Du will cover for us outside.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.090
According to the information
provided by Mr. Hong,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.320
Sasaki has only been meeting

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.240
with a man called Mr. Qiang.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.780
Since Mr. Qiang has been arrested,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.770
we can pretend to be his subordinates

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.830
and use this identity to meet Sasaki.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.510
You're Mr. Qiang?

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.410
Who are you?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260
I want to borrow something from you.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.200
Miss Lu.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.680
Tiger.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.680
Miss Lu,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.330
I am Mr. Sasaki's butler.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.920
Mr. Sasaki has already prepared

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.520
food and wine for you inside.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720
Please follow me.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.730
Please.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.870
I didn't expect that Mr. Qiang's necklace

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.330
would actually be useful.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.530
Please come inside.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.160
Miss Lu.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.920
I never thought
you're so young and beautiful

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.670
and already Qiang's capable subordinate.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.030
I'm sorry,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.480
but we still need to search you.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.740
Since we've come to their place,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.360
of course we should follow their rules.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.780
Please open it.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.440
Let him take a look.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.270
Mr. Sasaki,

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.920
Mr. Qiang respects you,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.480
so he agreed to send only the two of us.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.280
Shouldn't you
show us some respect as well?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.790
Yes.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.410
That's your fault.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.320
Miss Lu came here sincerely

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.710
to do business with us.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.830
How could...

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.810
there be anything wrong with this thing?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.540
Do you plan to make me stand
while talking to you?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.060
My fault, my fault!

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.720
Miss Lu,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.800
please sit.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.830
I've collaborated

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.820
with Mr. Qiang many times.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.210
But I've never seen you before.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.120
Now you have.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.090
Miss Lu,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.040
this drink is for you.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.880
I never thought
Mr. Qiang would still be managing

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680
a myriad of tasks even in prison.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.550
For Mr. Qiang,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.590
prison is just

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.650
a change of venue for doing business.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.550
This time,
he sent me to take over your dock.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.680
While Mr. Qiang is away,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.890
the business has been handed over
to Ms. Lu to manage.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.750
Why are you explaining these things
to an outsider?

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.790
I've had the honor

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.480
of collaborating with Mr. Qiang

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.540
many times before.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.510
But I never realized

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.550
he had such a beautiful

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.830
and capable right hand by his side.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.200
Impressive.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.720
How is Mr. Qiang doing in prison?

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.640
Why ask a question
you already know the answer to?

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.400
If he weren't doing well,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.200
I wouldn't have been sitting here
drinking with you.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.790
That's right. That's right.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.240
Come on.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.790
Let's drink to Mr. Qiang.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.650
To Mr. Qiang.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.490
I'll drink it on Ms. Lu's behalf.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.940
You seem particularly talkative today.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.700
Your subordinate is so considerate.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.260
Miss Lu, seems you've trained them well.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.580
We're all just working for Mr. Qiang.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.040
Come on.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440
This drink—

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.000
it's for you,

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.790
Mr. Sasaki.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.830
I hope we have a pleasant collaboration
this time.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.710
To our pleasant collaboration.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.440
Come on, let's drink together.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.380
Miss Lu, I didn't expect you
to be so forthright.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.550
Mr. Qiang's goods

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.380
have always been top quality.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.030
I wonder...

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.880
Miss Lu,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.720
if you could let us

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.920
have a look.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.420
Of course.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.330
It seems there's a treasure inside here.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.880
Mr. Sasaki.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.240
Those men of yours outside

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.840
must be tired from standing.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.870
Why not ask them to come in
to have a drink together?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.780
Well, Director Du,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.370
we're standing so close.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.970
Won't we be discovered?

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.050
I'm doing this on purpose.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:05.960
Why?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.660
If Lu Yizhen and the others
are in danger inside,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.690
I'll expose you.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.150
Then the danger transfers to you.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.770
Well...

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.700
Earlier, I only caught a brief glimpse

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.500
of half of Mr. Qiang's treasure.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.880
I wonder,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.880
Miss Lu, if you would mind

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.960
letting me take a closer look.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.960
What you saw is the entirety.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.310
The painting itself is incomplete.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.510
As for whether it's well-painted or not,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.910
that's not your concern.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.420
You're right, Miss Lu.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.360
How about this, Miss Lu?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.750
My dock will be open

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.950
for your use anytime.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.550
This time...

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:51.900
the robbery

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.410
has caused quite a stir in the city.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.440
The whole city is searching
for the whereabouts of these goods.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.550
At such a critical moment,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.630
Mr. Qiang
actually wants to sell in a hurry?

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.690
This doesn't seem like his style.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.830
What?

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.590
Does Mr. Qiang need
to report his private affairs to you?

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.350
No, no.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.080
It's just...

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.880
Mr. Sasaki,

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.160
you're not new in this business.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.030
You should know the rules
better than I do.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.980
Asking about someone else like this

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.040
isn't appropriate, don't you think?

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.790
Miss Lu.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.520
Since we've spoken so frankly,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.880
I have another speculation.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.540
Perhaps you'd like to hear it.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.960
There's been no news about Baldy Chen

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.590
and the others.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.220
It's not because they died in your hands.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.750
Instead,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.790
they've fallen into the hands
of the police station.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.590
This painting

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.110
is the bait.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.790
Whoever takes it

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.400
is the fish in the net

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.710
and the turtle in the jar.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.200
Mr. Sasaki.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.170
We came here

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.260
because we trusted your reputation.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.850
Since you don't trust Mr. Qiang,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.920
we simply can't continue

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.790
this deal.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.820
We'll just find someone else.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.880
Miss Lu,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.680
Shanghai is not a place for playing house.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.750
We live

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.200
on the edge of a knife.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.280
It's not that I want
to make things difficult for you.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.750
How about this?

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.670
Miss Lu, if you're truly sincere,

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.200
let your subordinate here

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.440
take a bullet.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.560
Is this how you do business?

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.110
It's just a deal,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.660
yet you want to sacrifice a subordinate?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.400
If the ruler wants a subordinate to die,
he can only obey.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.440
That is the rule.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.030
Look at my men.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.630
From their first day following me,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.790
they were prepared
to sacrifice themselves.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.920
You have your rules,

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.830
but Mr. Qiang has his.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.830
Shooting a subordinate at will

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:24.960
is not a rule of Mr. Qiang's.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.240
If I break it today,

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.920
how will Mr. Qiang
command respect in the future?

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.750
So,

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.720
Miss Lu,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.400
you want to give up this deal?

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.680
You won't even sacrifice

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.140
one of your subordinates.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.000
How can I trust you?

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.220
How can we do business?
