♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:53.386

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:55.946
It's pathetic
seeing you all protecting each other.

00:01:55.947 --> 00:01:58.756
No matter how hard you try to lie to us,

00:01:58.757 --> 00:01:59.676
I won't buy it.

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:01.826
Guess you'll have to see for yourselves.

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:03.787
(Casting a spell)

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:05.025
Datula...

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.516
It's a deadly flower that feeds on blood
and gnaws at the human heart.

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:09.403
If it's not removed,

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:11.017
it'll consume Siwat from within
and kill him.

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:16.763
Why are you so desperate
to go after such a dangerous place?

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:17.996
I need to see it with my own eyes.

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:19.766
You might die before you do.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.516
Everything must return to the beginning.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:23.387
The beginning?

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:46.123

(Casting a spell)

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.697
Surrender yourselves to me,

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:52.210
and you shall be spared.

00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:18.217
Suriya!

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:39.626
May Siva vanquish the darkness
that has consumed Tambralinga,

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:42.414
and may Kalakal's body and atman
be bound and sealed,

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:46.072
never to be reborn
to bring decay upon the people

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:46.996
from this moment forth!

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.032
I shall return
and take my revenge on all of you.

00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:25.947
So that his body shall never again
join with the atman,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.388
we must bury him within the sacred land.

00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:48.267
Such an act

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:50.227
is tantamount to accepting betrothal to Apo.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.599
Suriya is mine.

00:06:57.294 --> 00:06:59.337
He loves me, not you.

00:07:00.497 --> 00:07:02.647
I shall not allow my beloved
to be taken from me.

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:27.467
Suriya,

00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:29.803
you need to choose between me and Asuni.

00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:01.708
Suriya!

00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:04.327
Suriya...

00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:05.337
You...

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:08.108
The rebels shall meet their end.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:11.214
Kalakal!

00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:13.294
Kill me!

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:16.785
And Suriya shall fall with me.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.301
With his body,

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.988
I shall slaughter every soul
on the land you hold dear.

00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:34.283
You cannot do that.

00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:47.257
Asuni...

00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:49.236
Suriya?

00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:55.636
Draw him out,

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:59.134
and bind him with the Heart of the Vedas.

00:09:02.487 --> 00:09:03.076
Apo.

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:46.327
We two are the keepers
of the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:49.163
Through every life

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:50.508
and across a thousand years,

00:10:52.312 --> 00:10:56.334
our duty is to protect this city
from the darkness.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.403
One day,

00:10:59.587 --> 00:11:01.547
we will return to restore it again.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:27.607
Siwat...

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:28.501
Siwat!

00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:29.403
What's wrong?

00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:43.068
I'm okay.

00:11:50.557 --> 00:11:51.468
Pun!

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.668
Wait...

00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:53.854
Is that Kor?

00:11:53.857 --> 00:11:54.894
Right here!

00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:56.690
We're over here!

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:02.625
- Ouch!
- Hey!

00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:05.607
I thought you were dead
and that I'd never see you again!

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.494
You're safe now, Mind.

00:12:18.268 --> 00:12:19.497
You're all safe, right?

00:12:25.477 --> 00:12:26.290
Is everything okay?

00:12:28.837 --> 00:12:29.999
I think we should hurry,

00:12:30.094 --> 00:12:31.187
or it'll be too late.

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:32.697
Siwat's getting worse.

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:34.297
Wait,

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.152
someone needs to take Mind home.

00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:38.988
What about you?

00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:41.890
You know they need me.

00:12:42.385 --> 00:12:43.187
You're right.

00:12:45.257 --> 00:12:47.730
Pun, can you take her home?

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.187
Of course.

00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:50.457
Leave that to me.

00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:52.276
I'll be back as soon as possible.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.396
No need.

00:12:53.557 --> 00:12:54.785
I'll take care of this.

00:12:54.877 --> 00:12:56.116
I'll see you at home.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.187
Understand?

00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:58.617
Yes.

00:13:00.356 --> 00:13:01.665
We'll split into two teams.

00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:04.137
Thara and Earth, you two come with me.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.512
Dean,

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:07.017
you lead Kor and Waii the other way.

00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:09.187
Alright, let's go.

00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:13.187
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.047
You, too.

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:21.587
Kor.

00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:38.552
What the h*ll?

00:13:43.597 --> 00:13:45.432
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:13:46.237 --> 00:13:47.287
I'll see you at home.

00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:48.814
Alright. Go now.

00:13:52.494 --> 00:13:55.946

Stop!

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:03.912
Dad!

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:04.530
No!

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.889
Hey...

00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:37.657
You alright?

00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:40.769
I'm fine.

00:15:42.878 --> 00:15:43.853
Let me see.

00:15:54.928 --> 00:15:56.558
The closer we get to Tambralinga,

00:15:58.268 --> 00:16:00.188
the more I see the past,

00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:02.493
when we sealed Kalakal.

00:16:14.704 --> 00:16:16.369
Now I can see the whole past.

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:19.191
We must find the city gate immediately,

00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:21.889
before he unites
the atman with its mortal form.

00:16:37.555 --> 00:16:38.128
Khun!

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.169
Thara!

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:56.893
We're entering the fog forest,

00:16:57.853 --> 00:16:59.053
the final territory.

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.648
Once we make it out,

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:04.217
we'll reach Tambralinga.

00:17:07.744 --> 00:17:09.140
But the fog is toxic,

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.871
so we need to make it out
as fast as we can.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.518
That's why...

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.288
my father sealed this forest

00:17:21.548 --> 00:17:23.248
after he brought Thakoon here.

00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:28.682
I came here once

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:30.711
after my father died

00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:34.144
'cause I wanted to know
if what he was protecting with his life

00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:36.493
really existed.

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:39.838
And I found this out.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.768
I barely made it out.

00:17:54.471 --> 00:17:55.177
Earth,

00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:56.878
it's still not too late to leave.

00:17:57.308 --> 00:17:59.548
Khun and I
can take care of Siwat from now on.

00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.671
But I'll never leave my friends behind.

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:07.293
Khun,

00:18:07.802 --> 00:18:08.973
I found a way.

00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:11.511
There are fresh footprints over there.

00:18:12.318 --> 00:18:13.228
Follow me.

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:15.526
Be careful, guys.

00:18:37.728 --> 00:18:38.537
Hey!

00:18:40.617 --> 00:18:41.688
Step back.

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:27.853
Hey!

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:28.864
Siwat!

00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:30.842
Siwat!

00:19:37.528 --> 00:19:38.260
Go!

00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:39.798
Now!

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.231
What's this smell?

00:20:47.082 --> 00:20:48.071
It's the toxic fog forest

00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:51.701
that the mad scholar told us about.

00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:56.689
Wait.

00:20:58.064 --> 00:20:59.228
That son of a b*tch is here.

00:20:59.788 --> 00:21:00.755
I mean your son.

00:21:06.108 --> 00:21:06.864
Careful.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:08.137
The fog is toxic.

00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:11.007
Hurry.

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:11.737
Come on!

00:21:17.528 --> 00:21:18.311
What's going on?

00:21:31.618 --> 00:21:32.333
Stop!

00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:35.528
You think you're so tough, huh?

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.617
Fine, I'll take you down first.

00:21:38.857 --> 00:21:39.528
No, Maria!

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:40.435
Stop!

00:21:40.438 --> 00:21:41.528
Let go of me.

00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:43.940
Dad!

No!

00:21:48.108 --> 00:21:49.060
You're next.

00:21:49.158 --> 00:21:49.882
Dad!

00:21:52.388 --> 00:21:53.235
Kor!

00:21:55.218 --> 00:21:55.853
Kor!!

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.528
Go after her!

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:02.893
Come on.

Dad...

00:22:19.318 --> 00:22:20.486
Tell me it's not true.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.711
Maria said you betrayed me.

00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:28.246
I shouldn't have, Dad.

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:39.046
Is this yours?

00:22:39.528 --> 00:22:40.835
I found it at the camp.

00:22:44.898 --> 00:22:46.049
- Go.
- Dad!

00:22:46.248 --> 00:22:47.257
Go now.

00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:49.264
No, I'm not leaving.

00:22:49.882 --> 00:22:51.089
Just go!

00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:52.726
You...

00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:54.260
You need to survive!

00:22:54.602 --> 00:22:56.224
I won't make it out!

00:22:56.228 --> 00:22:57.087

00:22:57.088 --> 00:22:58.900

- Dad...

00:23:00.598 --> 00:23:01.388
I can't...

00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:03.118
I can't even move.

00:23:03.824 --> 00:23:05.169
You need to go now.
