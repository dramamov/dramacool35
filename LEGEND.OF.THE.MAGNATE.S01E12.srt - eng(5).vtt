I wanted to give you a gift.

I've been thinking about it,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.229
but couldn't decide what to pick.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.430

No need for that.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.280
I'm afraid I might not

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.860

can put my mind at ease.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.580
But I realized

Take it.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.950
Your safety is

This is His Highness's gift for you.

What use is it to me?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.090
My father was imprisoned,
and I almost got killed as well.

Could this possibly save me?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But you can keep it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.750

the title of "princess"

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.630

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.910
If I have to name someone

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.640
in this world

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.080
who makes my legs tremble
just by seeing them,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.810
it would definitely be Mr. Bai.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.390
You got off easy.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.600
Back in my day,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.030
he hit my hands

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.750
and twisted my ears,
which ended up like Buddha's long ears.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.160
That was what you get
for not studying hard.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.220
If you were like me,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
reciting articles well,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.720
you could even stay
for dinner at his house.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.440
If I had Miss Bai

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.480
studying with me,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.700
I would have done better than you.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.000
Well,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.020
how is Yimei doing?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.790
Has she

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.370
gotten married already?

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.200
No.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.320
I know.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.080
I made her

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.490
wait for me all these years.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.800
She's suffered.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.630
So,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.480
first thing tomorrow morning,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.610
I'll go visit Mr. Bai

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.440
and apologize to him in person.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.630
Whether he beats me up

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.670
or scolds me,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.040
at least it makes me feel better inside.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:10.820
By the way,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.960
on my way back,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.120
I saw some burned tea plants

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.380
in the tea plantation.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.340
What happened?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.840
Tell him.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.240
Otherwise, your brother

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.200
won't eat

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.480
or sleep well.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.840
Last month,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.910
soldiers fought a battle here.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.630
So the tea plantation was burned.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.080
Qimen was besieged, too.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.720
And Miss Bai was taken away

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.920
by the southern army.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.070
In the whole village,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.960
except for little girls and elderly women,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960
all women who could work were

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.910
taken away.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.320
They said
it was to look after wounded soldiers

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.510
and do laundry.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.670
They promised to release them in 10 days,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.070
but it's been a month now.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.750
These days,
people in the village are saying

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.080
that we should select someone

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.540
to go demand their return.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.140
But we can't get in.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.770
We would be driven away at the gate.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.960
They have all kinds of weapons,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.480
like swords, guns, spears, and axes.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.410
Are we throwing ourselves at them?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.410
Do you know which army it is?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.109
It's said to be
the Resistance Army from Guangxi.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.170
They're led by a general surnamed Li.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.750
He's quite formidable.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.950
They're even planning to attack Hefei.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200
So, when is our village

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.440
planning to ask for our people back?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.000
I already told you.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.270
We can't get through the camp entrance.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.680
Who would dare to force their way in?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.410
No one dares.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.990
Yimei has been captured.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.070
Then Mr. Bai...

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.160
Pingyuan,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.670
you should go see him tomorrow.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.280
All these years, it's been Pingwen

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.030
delivering firewood and water

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.830
to their home.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.970
Yimei's life hanging by a thread,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.180
Mr. Bai must be

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.880
as worried as I used to be.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.960
Mother,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.510
don't think too much.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.710
Let's enjoy our meal.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.790
Now that I'm back,

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.950
I won't be away for so long again.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.830
This war will eventually

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.030
come to an end one day.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.960
And I think that day will soon come.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.090
Once the war is over,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.270
Pingwen and I will

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.730
fix up the tea plantation.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.610
We'll continue selling our tea,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.870
run our business well,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.050
and live a good life.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.640
Mother,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.140
don't worry too much.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.510
Your health comes first.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.120
Our good days are yet to come.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.280
Don't fall ill or get into trouble.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.550
I once heard

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.440
these words in my dreams.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.030
Now I can hear you say them in person.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.950
Even if I were to die right now,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.080
it would be worth it.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.720
Pingyuan,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.470
I don't remember seeing you
carry a shoulder pole before.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.930
You're doing pretty well.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.030
I used to think of myself as a scholar.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.520
Why would I need to carry firewood?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.780
But later in Ningguta,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:20.880
I hunted tigers in the mountains

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.350
and panned for gold in the rivers.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.160
Carrying a shoulder pole?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.420
That's a piece of cake.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.440
Mr. Bai,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.130
I, Pingwen, am here

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.510
to bring you water and firewood.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.480
Carrying water and delivering firewood are

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.070
two jobs.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.920
What do you mean
by "bring you water and firewood"?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920
Do you have multiple heads and arms?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.310
Did you hear that, Pingyuan?

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.350
How nitpicky he is.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.890
This isn't nitpicking.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.130
Incorrect names lead to discrepancies
between words and truths.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.720
And with these discrepancies,
things won't make sense.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.010
If things won't make sense,
nothing can be accomplished.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.200
Didn't I teach you this

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.640
when you were a student?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.720
Mr. Bai,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.850
I-I'll be going now.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.070
Mr. Bai.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.390
[Bai Shi'an, Private School Teacher]

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.970
I'm your student, Gu Pingyuan.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:23.640
I'm back

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.740
to greet you.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.750
P-Pingyuan, you're back?

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.590
Pingyuan!

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.380
You rascal.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.000
You little rascal.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.400
I...

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.000
You made us worried sick about you.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.750
Do you know that?

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.590
Good.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:13.200
Come on.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.200
Get up now.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.110
Get up quickly.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.610
Alright, let's...

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.750
L-Let's go inside

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.540
to have a nice chat.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.470
Come inside quickly.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.350
[A long journey
with heavy responsibilities]

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.510
Come on in.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.480
Mr. Bai,

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.920
your place hasn't changed at all.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.720
That's great.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.880
What's so good about it?

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.310
I remember back then,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.840
seeing that I was too small,

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.340
you let me sit in the front.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.210
Right here.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.310
At that time, my feet

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.110
couldn't even touch the ground.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.070
You squatted

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.590
by my wall to eavesdrop every day,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.920
fell asleep halfway through,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.850
and even snored.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.200
I kept wondering

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.920
if my teaching was really that boring.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.720
The sunshine was so comfortable back then.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.510
Once I basked in the sun,

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.970
I'd fall asleep in no time.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.710
Did you come back yesterday?

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.790
My mother told me that you've been

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.520
having trouble with your legs.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.450
She asked Pingwen and me

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.510
to come visit you early this morning.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.640
Is your mother feeling better?

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.510
Last night, when she saw me

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.830
and we talked for a while,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.630
her eyes seemed to light up a bit.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.720
I've failed to be

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.460
a good son all these years.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.000
Someone set you up
in the examination site.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.060
Guess it was a tribulation
you were destined to suffer.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.570
Being back today is

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.640
a blessing in and of itself.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.400
Mr. Bai,

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.370
please don't sigh.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.760
I heard

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.070
that Yimei was taken away, right?

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.680
All the women in the village

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.880
have been taken away.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.160
I think they're probably

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.270
being made to do sewing and washing work.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.110
Isn't the village just

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.240
looking for a representative

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.200
to go to the camp
and ask for their return?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.480
I think I can go.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.980
A scholar can't talk sense

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.640
into soldiers.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.030
Don't go.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.370
We should choose a smooth talker.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.580
Mr. Bai,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.830
I'm no longer a scholar.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.650
My academic title was revoked.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.240
Now I've got a way

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.680
with words.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.790
Trust me.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.550
These past few years,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.000
you've indeed grown a lot.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.790
Once I bring Yimei back,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.250
I'll marry her right away.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.240
Last night with my mother,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.300
I said these words.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:50.830
Today, facing you, Mr. Bai,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.960
I say the same thing.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.550
Mr. Bai,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.350
you must take good care of yourself.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.680
I still need to take good care of you
as my father-in-law.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.270
If this comes true,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.640
I'd be such a lucky man
in my twilight years!

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.110
I have a good student,

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.090
an excellent son-in-law,
to bring me joy by my side.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.400
How wonderful.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.610
What a joy.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.240
Pingwen.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.750
Is there any place nearby
that sells hemp ropes?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.310
Hemp ropes? We have some at home.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.760
No, I mean the big kind.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.820
In large bundles. The thick type.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.180
Those villages down there all grow hemp.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.640
You could go look for them.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.210
How much do you want to buy?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.840
About 400 or 500 taels worth.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.200
400 or 500 taels?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.270
That's about several warehouses of hemp!

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.800
Exactly.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.000
Is that possible?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680
Stop bragging, okay?

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.880
Even if you have people
from several villages

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.000
twist ropes with you

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.680
for three years,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.240
you still can't make

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.840
ropes worth 400 or 500 taels.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.830
A quick question for you.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.590
Would you like to learn

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.850
to do business from me?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.270
I'd like to.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.540
But I only know how to grow tea.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.280
Well then,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.480
from now on,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.680
I'll be your teacher.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:17.960
Observe carefully when you're with me,

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.720
listen closely,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.290
and ask me privately
about anything you don't get.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:20.890
Remember,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.450
never question

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.610
any of my decisions in front of others.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.750
Alright. Have a safe trip, sir.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.480
These are the last two baskets.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.480
How do I look?

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.480
Why did you grab

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.270
Li's glasses?

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.070
I paid!

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.450
They'll come in handy.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.910
Let's go

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.170
sell hemp ropes.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.160
[The Military Camp of Li Cheng,
Resistance Army]

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.380
Stop there!

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.240
Where do you think you're trespassing?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:17.720
Go back!

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.400
Go back?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.580
What about my cartload of goods?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.360
Take your things and get lost.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.420
No outsiders are allowed
into the military camp.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.550
Don't you know that?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.510
Young man,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.130
may I have your name?

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.070
So when Li Cheng asks me about it,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.030
I can tell him

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.880
who drove me away.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.590
If you don't make yourself clear,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.050
how can we let you in?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.270
Our general's orders are

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.260
very strict.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.970
Let me tell you.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.960
This cartload of goods is urgent supplies

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.830
for your naval forces,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.270
not easy to get these days.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.640
Not letting me in, right?

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.100
Fine, we're leaving.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.060
Wait, wait, wait!

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.590
Was it really the General
who asked you to come?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.370
Come on, get up here.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.910
I'll take you inside.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.950
You can ask him yourself, alright?

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.350
You may go in by yourself.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:22.830
Listen,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.490
once you enter the camp,

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:25.790
you must get off the wagon

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.640
and don't park anywhere.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.000
All forms of driving
and horseback riding are

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.330
prohibited in the camp.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.900
Pay attention to this.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.720
Yes, sir.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.880
Come on,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.870
clear the way!

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.200
There are two people outside

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.350
asking to meet the General.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.350
It's these two, right?

00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.720
Yes.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:00.870
You may go.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.830
You're the one
looking for our general, huh?

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.430
General Li is busy with work.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.640
Just leave these things

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.740
over there and go.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.240
I'll report it to him later.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.200
Go and report

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920
that his cousin,

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.610
Gu Pingyuan, is here.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.790
How impertinent!

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.110
No matter how busy he is,

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.310
how can he not meet me?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.070
Cousin?

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.640
So you claim to be

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.300
our general's cousin, right?

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.720
Go report to him now!

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.400
Alright.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.780
How about this?

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.160
You go by yourselves.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.010
See that gate ahead?

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.080
Go through it

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.160
and then go straight.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.240
The large tent up front is

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.050
our general's headquarters.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.120
Go ahead.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.150
Off you go.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.780
Take it slow in there.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:02.790
Go ahead.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.000
Li

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.600
leads his troops quite well.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.460
How do you know about leading troops?

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.550
Back when I was in Ningguta,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.160
I hung around with the soldiers there

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160
and learned a bit.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.940
I think you've

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.650
picked up other skills, too.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:29:59.640
What?

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.790
Your smooth talk and lies.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.480
How could you be

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.770
Li Cheng's cousin?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.920
What will you say

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.250
when you meet him later?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.400
I'm just playing it by ear.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.400
How else would we get in without bluffing?

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.490
Is General Li Cheng inside?

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.360
I, Gu Pingyuan, am seeking an audience.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.600
Is General Li Cheng inside?

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.270
I, Gu Pingyuan, am seeking an audience.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.080
Is General Li Cheng inside?

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.480
You bluffer.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.240
Cousin?

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:00.770
Take them away.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.580
Do we really

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.920
have to besiege Hefei?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.400
The imperial court's army

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.390
has already pulled through
the toughest time.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.110
The navy controls
the middle and upper reaches.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.270
Now we still have a chance

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.330
to push northward.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.510
If we spend

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.510
too much time in Hefei,

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.110
it will bring us big trouble!

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.240
Do you still remember

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.840
the last northern campaign?

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.170
Say no more.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.160
We'll follow orders from above.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.550
I'm afraid he only cares

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.880
about his Sufu Province

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.660
and ignores Tianjing.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.240
Ever since His Lordship passed away,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.440
something feels off.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.690
Forgive me for saying this,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.640
but our situation is deteriorating

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.590
day by day.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:46.730
General,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.460
there's no point

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.940
in our staying in Huizhou.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.200
They want us to create a diversion
to support the navy.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.460
With these few troops,

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.710
how can we pull it off?

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.590
Besides, given Huizhou's low terrain,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.590
we're here just for the imperial court

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.050
to have its troops raid us.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.550
With insufficient forces,

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.680
a long defense line,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.550
and frequent night attacks from the enemy,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.820
all camps are rattled

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.490
in a state of low morale.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.510
Everyone,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.110
you're all my old pals

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.910
from Guangxi.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.920
I've joined
the Resistance Army since childhood,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.180
rising from a child soldier to a general.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.510
I clearly remember

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.400
that we all swore

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.730
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.030
Since we followed the Heavenly King,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.490
kept our hair, and rose up,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.000
we should know

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.510
that this is a war to the death

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.710
with no turning back.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.280
Alright,

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.920
return to your camps

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.550
and stabilize the morale.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.350
Furthermore,

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.200
don't let me hear of anyone

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.800
plundering villages again.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.960
Otherwise,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.030
I'll execute them before reporting

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.830
with no mercy.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.200
Yes, General.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.440
Who is that general?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.030
You've claimed to be
my general's cousin for a while.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.830
And you don't even know who he is?

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.510
General Li!

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.450
General Li!

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.570
How stupid you are.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.510
Swaggering into our camp so boldly,

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.030
you truly have no regard

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.530
for those heroic figures.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.620
I'm just a small merchant.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.850
To seek profits,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680
I played a trick and accidentally

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.740
entered your camp.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.400
Please forgive me, General.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.590
A small merchant?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.720
You're lying!

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.370
Who on earth are you?

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.790
Where's my brother?

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.480
Your brother?

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.550
Your brother is dead because of you.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.480
Your brother...

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.590
General Li, you lead the army
in a disciplined way,

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.200
and you don't look like someone
who kills innocents.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.060
I just want to make a deal with you.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.530
Will you let me up, please?

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.030
Make a deal?

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:09.790
[Li Cheng, General of the Resistance Army]

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:10.670
What deal?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.560
Did you see

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.050
my cart full of hemp ropes?

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.440
I know your navy

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.670
needs a large quantity of hemp ropes

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.000
to reinforce the ships.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.230
People in Huizhou

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.480
dare not sell any to you.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.540
I can help you purchase what you need.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.080
Does he look like

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.909
a spy sent by the imperial court?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.489
Yes, he does.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.190
No, I don't.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.230
I...

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.000
About 25 kilometers from here,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.280
there's Shanjian Village.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.739
You took

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.880
all the women here

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.020
from that village,

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.800
saying that you would

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.960
return them in 10 days.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.070
It's been a month now,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.150
and there's been no news at all.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.409
I'm from that village.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860
What's your name?

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.110
My name is Gu Pingyuan.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.340
I've lived in Shanjian Village
since childhood.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.920
I have a teacher surnamed Bai.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.630
His daughter is called Bai Yimei.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.510
"Mei" as in plum blossom.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.920
She should be in your military camp now.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.719
You can ask her

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.670
about me.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.330
Continue with the hemp ropes.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320
I know you need

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.550
a whole lot of hemp ropes.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.630
The people in the village might

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.430
not be enough.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.130
All these women can twist ropes.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.110
Letting them back

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.640
can work in your favor, too.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.170
I have so many wounded soldiers.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.630
Who will take care of them
if the women leave?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.000
General,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.290
forgive me for being blunt.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.360
You won't be able

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.760
to stay here much longer.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.460
Those women are innocent.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.310
I don't want them to die here.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960
Who told you

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.680
that I won't be staying here long?

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.550
You've been besieging Hefei

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.550
for over 2 months.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.110
Yet you still haven't taken it.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.540
Once the imperial court's troops arrive,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.000
they'll surround you completely.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.460
Watch what you're saying!

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.570
General Li,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.240
I just have one question.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.840
Have you already killed

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.960
those women who were brought here?

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.760
If so,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.530
just give me a straight answer.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.990
So I can go back to the village
with the news.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.080
Untie his feet.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.080
Bring him out.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.280
Yes, General.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.690
Come on.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.870
Open the door.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.190
See?

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:47.510
In our Resistance Army,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.770
we have separate camps for men and women.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.010
Even married couples
must sleep separately.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.550
We lead our troops differently

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.880
from those brutal guys.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.000
For the poor things in the world,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.400
we treat men like our brothers

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.930
and women like our sisters.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.760
Our Resistance Army

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.220
will never mistreat them.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.960
See clearly now?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.690
If you do, then just leave.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:08.550
Get these two brothers

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.250
out of the camp.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:09.980
Understood.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:10.710
Go.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.320
Go!

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.400
Night raid!

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.100
Form ranks for battle!

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.400
Charge!

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:29.670
Kill them!

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:45.630
Yimei.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.630
Yimei!

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.030
Yimei!

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.670
Yimei!

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.800
Yimei!

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.000
Yimei.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.070
Yimei!

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.320
Yimei!

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.000
Yimei!

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.030
Yimei!

Yimei!

Yimei!

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.070
Gu!

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.400
Gu!

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.360
Gu!

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.030
Gu!

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.590
Yimei.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:01.670
Yimei.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:06.740
It really is you.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:08.690
Did you get hurt?

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.840
[Bai Yimei, Daughter of Bai Shi'an]

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.760
Where are the other women
from our village?

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.330
They scattered when the firing started.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.950
Quickly, come with me.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.440
No.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.110
These two were wounded by arrows.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.040
They need water every few minutes.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.470
At a time like this, you still...

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.800
Then help me first.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.030
Move aside!

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.510
Get out of the way!

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.510
Move!

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.420
Fire!

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.680
Pingwen?

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.840
Save me!

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.590
Help! Help me!

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.360
Help!

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.790
It's on fire!

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.920
Untie them all.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.150
I'll go find the other women.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.670
Okay.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.630
Help me!

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.280
Okay.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.470
I'll help you one by one.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.400
Anyone from Shanjian Village?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.190
Is there anyone from Shanjian Village?

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.030
Those from Shanjian Village, follow me!

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.710
Anyone from Shanjian Village?

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.310
Pingyuan!

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.400
Pingyuan.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.530
Pingwen.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.450
Yimei is still in the hut.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.320
Let's hurry inside!

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:34.710
Okay.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.230
Yimei!

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.030
Yimei!

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.320
No time to waste!

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:39.920
Let's run.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.080
Be careful.
