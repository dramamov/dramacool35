Fine.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.130
Don't eat then.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.000
Just don't order anything. And don't talk.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.740
Just sit here

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.500
and see who's better...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.460
Go.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.379
Those are my customers.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.130
Don't chase them away like that.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.130
Why are you scaring them?

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.630
That's not how you should behave.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.960
You can't act like this.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.630
You...

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.000
Don't come near me.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
This is my territory.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.670
Don't come any closer.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.130
It scares me when you walk toward me
like that.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.250
I heard you've been taking care of
quite a lot of people in there,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.380
even the warden?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380
So caring, huh?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.940
He just happened to need help
with some trivial matter.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Yeah, that's it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Oh, I see. Did it go well?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.130
Yeah, quite well.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.460
The warden is quite nice.
He kept his word.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.250
It went well? That's good.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.600
Have you heard of disability certificates?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.060
Sis Wenfeng, do you have
some kind of physical condition?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.120
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.000
I meant getting one for your mom!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.750
Alright?

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.630
Your mom works so hard
selling beef noodles,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.090
yet how much does she make?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.750
Just get her a disability certificate

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.330
and sell lottery tickets.
Money would come faster that way.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.380
Okay? Alright?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.970
Darn it. Are you missing a screw or what?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.580
You went straight to the warden like that—

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.509
what if your identity got exposed?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.880
I understand now.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.330
You understand, huh?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130
You're not even listening!

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.500
What exactly do you want?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.250
Why does he keep filming me?

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.810
You're eating my braised egg.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.140
Did you wash your hands?

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
You'll have diarrhea if you don't
wash your hands before eating.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
Eating even more?

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.390
You're not even listening!

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.250
I'm just giving you a warning today.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.130
If you don't behave yourself from now on,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.190
I'll send people to mess with
your mom's shop every day.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.880
Sis.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.400
How is it? Tasty?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.630
Pretty good. Not bad.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.880
Just "pretty good"?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.250
Is it good? Come on.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.250
How is it? Is it delicious?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.750
Yeah, it's delicious.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.250
Seeing you enjoy the food

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.000
makes me really happy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Let's take a selfie first.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.290
Let's say it together to the camera.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.040
Together.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.130
Yay!

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.750
Seeing you enjoy the food makes me happy.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.800
Can I add some chili?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.670
Sure.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.870

[Episode 5]

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.080
He won alone once

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.460
and now thinks he's capable of
earning 750.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.320
But we're taking 50,000 from him.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.500
Taking it all.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.000
I'll keep raising this goldfish here.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.210
And I'll keep a tank of sharks there.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.000
Sharks?

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.040
Like "Baby Shark Doo Doo."

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.000
You're a genius.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.500
Sharks. Sharks. Sharks.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.830
-Shark Doo Doo!
-Sharks! Sharks! Sharks!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.930
Keep it down. What are you doing?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.630
We're celebrating.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.200
Right, I lost 2 kilos.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.280
He's going to be a model.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.440
Didn't you just say "Fish Ball Soup"?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.570
That was my late night snack, yeah.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.970
Thank you, hottie.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.250
We'll keep it down. Sorry.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.500
We'll keep our voices down.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500
Keep it down. There are others here.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.440
So what should we do about the match?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.000
Not many people signed up this time.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.750
What should we do?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.630
So we need someone with buzz.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.830
What do you mean buzz?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.880
Whoever is strong will create buzz.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.180
So who's strong?

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.040
Xiao Wenqiang.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.790
Since he can't win,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.040
the odds will be high!

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.420
I didn't think of that!

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.820
There are stray dogs at the sports field.
Jiajun, go help out.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.210
Director, I'm off duty. I requested leave
for this afternoon.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.480
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.360
Zhiyao, you go.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.590
Okay, got it.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.040
Jiajun, go assist the Health Division.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.250
Director, I have a bad cold.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.850
Alright, then don't come in.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.790
Zhiyao, you go.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.540
Okay, got it.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.710
Zhiyao, Jiajun called in sick again today.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.710
Hurry to the sports field to help out.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.210
Zhiyao, Jiajun's grandfather
is getting remarried today.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.610
You handle the afternoon body inspection.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.560
I'm truly sorry,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.360
but Jiajun is attending
his grandfather's funeral today.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.710
You and Zhongwen
need to cover Jiajun's duties.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.290
Show him some support.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.920
Hey, I folded that!

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.790
I'm just organizing my own stuff.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.880
You always steal other people's work!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.920
-What do you mean always?
-What are you doing? Sit down.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.670
Sit down and stop arguing. Sit down.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.170
I'm organizing my own stuff.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.330
He always does this.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.290
If it doesn't concern you, stay out of it.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.920
This isn't the first time.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.170
What's your problem?

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.290
You want to fight, huh?

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.120
You want to get points deducted, huh?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.540
You don't want to get out of here, huh?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.290
Sit down!

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.400
What do you want?

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.320
Why are you arguing?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.790
What nonsense.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.290
Inmate, next time if there's an issue,
speak directly to the CO.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.040
Don't argue.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.850
And you. How many times
have people complained about you?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.170
Always stealing other people's work.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.920
CO.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.040
What?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.500
I need to use the bathroom.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
I'm working myself to death here,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.240
and you're just sitting there reading.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.040
What?

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.700
Finally decided to talk to me?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.600
I don't have time for your games
right now.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.250
Who's playing games with you?

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.960
Besides, this is a two-person guard duty,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.130
not a solo shift.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.560
Everything looks fine to me.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.200
Can't I read my book
when everything's fine?

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.330
Everything's fine?

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.280
-Just now…
-CO.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.130
Go back to your seat.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.830
Of course everything seems fine,
because I'm handling all the issues,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.360
while you're just reading.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880
Didn't I just say

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.930
it's exactly because everything's fine
that I'm reading?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.100
So ugly.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.130
You folded this, okay?

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.290
I didn't fold this.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.330
You folded it.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.500
Stop folding and get out.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.430
What do you want?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.030
You think you're the boss now, huh?
What's the deal?

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.030
What are you arguing about? Stop it.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.680
How old are you?
Still arguing like children.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640
What's your deal?

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.429
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.090
Today's duties were already assigned.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.000
It was supposed to be your job
to take the inmates out.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.330
I already took them to
the Health Division for you.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.610
I saw you taking people out,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.570
and that's why I'm keeping watch here.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.710
You're keeping watch?
Are you actually paying attention?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.250
I'm only doing my own stuff
because nothing's happening.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.880
Did you help out
when the inmates were arguing just now?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.630
What?

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.700
Are you two even watching over things?

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.710
Is this a party or what?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.880
The count's not right.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.730
Everyone, stop what you're doing!

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.760
Roll call!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.150
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.500
You just took someone
to the Health Division.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.700
Why didn't you log it?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.040
Why me?

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.520
You're supposed to do the logging
when I take inmates out.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.290
That inmate wasn't feeling well.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.500
Whoever takes them out
should be the one to log it.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.750
Now I'm the one not feeling well.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.250
The roll call shows 18,

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.790

Yes.

You think you're not involved?

When your teammates get scolded,
you're also at fault.

Not an ounce of team spirit!

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.290
Our Central Prison has
a table tennis tournament coming up.

This tournament

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.890
will start with an exhibition match.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.630
The purpose of this exhibition match

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.880
is to showcase
our Custody Division's team spirit.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.250
It's pretty interesting this year.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.250
Someone volunteered to
challenge our chief.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.630
You know what?

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.250
In previous years, it was always me
competing alongside Chief.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.020
But my shoulder is a bit sore

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.250
this year, so I can't play.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.250
So now we need to find a replacement.

You know, Shui used to be

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.580
on the table tennis team back in school.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.030
It's only because he's injured now

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.880
that we need to find some new blood.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.810
That's how it is.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.930
Who's up to it?

For this match,

I've specially practiced a new move,

called the Thunder Whirlwind Storm Smash!

Okay, thanks.

Why do you think we didn't ask you?

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.630
Because you're truly terrible at it.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.170
-Go sit back down.
-Go.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.720
None of the others can play well.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.930
That's why we need new blood.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.500
Who among you is up to it?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.050

Not bad.

But he gets nosebleeds.

He might not be able to
play the whole match.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.340
That won't do.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.490

some basic skills, right?

Because we practice even more
than they do.

It concerns our dignity, so we can't lose.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.970
Don't take it personally, okay?

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.540
Yu Jiajun.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.080
The table is covered with your stuff.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.810
Aren't you going to clean it up?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.680
I'll clean it when I get back.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.090
What about your leftover breakfast?

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.420
I can take care of it.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.130
Zhongwen will clean it up.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.940
You didn't clean up your instant noodles
from last night either.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.490
Can you please stop doing this?

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.090
The dorm belongs to all of us.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.210
Is this enough?

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.420
You call that cleaning up?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.170
What do you want then?

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.420
It's always the two of us
taking out the trash.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.290
Are you not embarrassed?

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.350
I'll take it out when I get back, okay?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.690
What's your problem?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040
Clean it up now.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.920
Don't fight.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.310
You can't leave if you don't clean it up.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.870
Clean it up now!

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.040
Jiajun, are you okay?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.440
Yu Jiajun, you're bleeding.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.110
Go away!

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.990
I already gave you the anesthesia.
Stop screaming.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.040
It's almost done.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.290
Alright, alright.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.470
Hang in there. Last stitch.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.100
I'm tying the knot now.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.040
Remember when you go back,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.140
keep the wound dry.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.180
Try not to touch it for the next few days.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.110
I'll talk to Director Xiao for you.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.330
Come back tomorrow so I can check it.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.920
Did you hear me?

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.360
Hello, are you listening?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.380
Do you have paper and a pen?

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.150
What do you need them for?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.550
What's wrong?

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.350
Come on, don't be sad.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.100
I can't take the exam like this.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.320
It's okay.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.520
You can take it next time.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.510
What's wrong?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.920
It's alright.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.340
You can just take it next time.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.860
Central Desk broadcasting:

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.200
the annual table tennis tournament
of Central Prison

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.700
is about to begin.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.630
All staff and inmates
participating in the exhibition match,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.200
please gather at the Activity Center.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.510
End of announcement.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.040
This year's recreational competition

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.920
will again begin with an exhibition match

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.070
between the administrators
and the inmates.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.720
I hope you can all exercise your strength

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.580
and develop good sportsmanship.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.850
Go, Wa!

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.670
The match begins now.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.680
Heads.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.010
Inmate Team serves first.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.790
Nice!

00:20:59.420 --> 00:20:59.880
Come on!

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.790
Let's go!

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.290
Come on!

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.920
Focus. Don't embarrass me.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.420
-Come on.
-Yes, Director.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.580
Come on, Zhiyao!

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.430
We've been champions for years.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.840
Nice shot!

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.630
Nice shot!

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.420
Good job.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.970
Keep it up.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.670
One more.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.790
One more.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.440
Come on!

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440
Concentrate.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.100
Yes.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.580
Come on.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.200
Focus. Focus.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.790
One more.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.540
Come on!

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.290
One more!

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.540
Your turn.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.670
That's ridiculous.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.600
-No way.
-Are you throwing the ball or what?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.820
Throwing it out like a frisbee.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.940
You idiot.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640
Is that okay?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.850
How long are you going to take
picking it up?

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:11.710
Director Xiao.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.910
Your newcomer here is quite naive, huh?

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.420
Just an idiot.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.200
Come on.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.470
Be careful.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.770
Yes!

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.260
Director Xiao is amazing!

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.630
Director, you are so good.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:39.870
One more.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.040
Come on!

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.540
Come on!

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.930
Go for it!

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.920
Meat Soup, nice shot!

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.420
Alright, don't try so hard.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.950
Be careful.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.430
I'll fight them to the end!

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.630
-Don't get hurt.
-Come on, Zhiyao.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.790
Their serve now.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320
It's okay.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.220
Come on!

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.670
Yes!

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.390
Yes!

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.210
-Got it.
-Nice shot.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.020
Your turn.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.230
What the hell are you doing?

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.580
Your turn.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.480
Your turn! What are you doing?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.070
Nice!

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100
Nice shot.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.180
Cool!

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.010
So cool!

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.080
You...

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.420
Got it.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.420
Again!

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.670
You're blocking me!

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.710
It's okay. Come on.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200
-Nice shot!
-Yes!

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:11.850
Nice shot!

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.420
-Sorry.
-Almost.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.290
9-all.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.670
9-all.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.130
Alright, come on! Last point. 9-all.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.790
-If you can't get it done...
-How's that? Isn't Director cool?

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.590
Yeah, so cool.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.540
9-all.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.080
One more, Zhiyao. Focus!

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.100
Steady now.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.130
Focus!

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.590
Come on!

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.110
Focus!

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.640
Come on!

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.320
Come on!

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.350
Nice!

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.040
Perfect!

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:04.970
It hit the edge!

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.860
It hit the edge.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:07.720
Call a timeout.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.450
-Director.
-Call a timeout for me.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.540
-Time out. Time out.
-What's wrong, Director?

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.540
I hurt my back.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.170
Are you okay?

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.540
You hurt your back?

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.290
So we don't have to
continue the game, right?

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.170
What do you mean
we don't have to continue?

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.420
We're just one point away from winning!
We're not stopping here.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.210
Director.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.050
Are you okay?

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.070
Not really.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.990
Do you want someone to substitute for you?

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.910
Hey.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.540
If his back is hurt, why not just forfeit

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.920
and count it as our win?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:28.920
Exactly.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.050
No. I mean it.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.970
Winning or losing isn't important.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.620
What matters is our sportsmanship,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.240
alright?

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.400
So I've decided

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.680
we'll make a substitution.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.600
Find someone to take my place.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.310
Okay.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.190
Substitution!

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.140
Sit down!

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.270
Your team is already in the lead,
and you still want to make a substitution?

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.400
That's not fair.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.080
Let me handle this, okay?

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.490
Director is injured. It can 't be helped.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.240
I'll do it.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.290
-Take my place.
-I can do it.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.540
-Take my place.
-I can do it. I'll take your place.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.170
Alright, Instructor will take my place.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.280
-Shui, I'll play. I'll substitute for him.
-Okay.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.180
But he's from the Education Division.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.810
Director.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.650
If you really can't play
because of your back,

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.810
then just forfeit.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.390
If you forfeit,
then count it as our Inmate Team's win.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.520
That's right.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.300
Inmate Team.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.380
Inmate Team!

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.940
Inmate Team!

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.730
Inmate Team!

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.700
What are you doing? Be quiet!

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.850
-Let's play it right, okay?
-Sit down!

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.100
The most important thing is
to make sure the game's fun

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.600
and everyone enjoys it, right?

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.400
Well, Inmate 9568,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.990
I used to be in the Custody Division too.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.870
That's right.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.240
How about this?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.720
If you let us substitute,

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.640
and if you win,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.990
I'll give you all extra points!

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.040
Sure. Extra points, how about that?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.920
-Extra points.
-Sounds nice, right?

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.670
-Right?
-Is that okay?

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.670
Let us make the substitution.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.790
Zhang Longji,
let us make the substitution.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.040
Replacing him actually gives you
an advantage, right?

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.170
Come on, what's there to be afraid of?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.170
-You agree, right?
-Let's start playing. Come on.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.540
-Let's start.
-The game begins!

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.670
Come on! Let's play!

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.420
Come on!

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.330
Secure that win!

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.040
Come on.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.190
Come on.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.170
Director.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:53.920
Gao Zhiyao.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.290
I know what you're up to.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.410
Don't let me catch you.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.720
Senior, what are you talking about?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.870
I was playing seriously just now.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.740
Let's do this.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.040
Come on!

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.170
Jiang Yijie!

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.790
Go, Jiang Yijie!

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.540
Yijie's got this!

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.540
Come on!

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.040
This shot decides everything!

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.240
Yijie, score a point!

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.260
We won!

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.420
Yijie!

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.290
Nice shot!

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.290
Yijie's the best!

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.580
Cool!

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.080
Yijie's the man!

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.830
Nice shot, Zhiyao!

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.100
Zhiyao must be the MVP.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.550
That concludes our game.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.190
Number one!

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.390
As expected from a P.E. student.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.430
The CO Team wins.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.920
We've got a P.E. student, you know?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.330
Nice!

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.160
Tiantian.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.940
The ball dropped.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.760
Officer.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.310
Let's talk.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.150
Officer.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.250
We've talked to you about this.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.410
We've talked to you about this. Right?

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.910
We've set up all the bets.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.140
Boss, here.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.580
Wa.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.850
I...

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.880
I did my best.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.900
I've already tried my best.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:46.910
I can see that.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.020
So you didn't do your best?

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.390
Boss, that's not true.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.600
You saw it yourself.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.000
I really gave it my all this time.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.260
I dove with my whole body.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.520
Officer, I don't care.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.420
All our losses are on you this time.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.820
Get ready to be humiliated by us
for the rest of your life.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.100
Please don't.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.490
Director Xiao was too good.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.350
And that Jiang Yijie suddenly stepped in.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.480
That's why things turned out this way.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.720
Bro.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.540
I'm already miserable. Please.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.630
You couldn't even throw a game.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.590
Then go take down
that Jiang guy for me.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.100
Take him down?

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.140
How? He's a counselor.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.670
So you're afraid of him but not me?

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.270
That Jiang guy keeps

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.760
a tank of precious things
on his desk, right?

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.570
Come here.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.110
Just talk normally.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.570
Why are you licking my ear?

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.060
Let me tell you.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.540
As long as you want to do it,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.330
anyone

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.830
can be taken down.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.970
Anyone.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.660
Take down anyone.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.200
What are you doing?

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.020
Are you a pervert?

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.450
Don't pull my pants down!

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.070
Shui.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.780
The date is wrong.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.060
Living too happily, huh?

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.090
Oh, you're right.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.560
How's your hand?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.500
Yu Jiajun!

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.200
You've got nothing better to do or what?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.250
Writing appeal letters for inmates?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.550
Let me see.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.750
Sued for public insult.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.730
Headcount and time confirmed.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.630
Zhiyao!

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.130
Someone filed a complaint against you.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.000
Against me?

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.320
For what?

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.170
Public insult.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.060
What happened?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.130
Inmate 5514?

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.110
What did I do?

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.180
What's going on between you two?

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.910
Getting more and more issues.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.310
He says you defamed him

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.610
by calling him a habitual thief.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.510
I did not.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.920
Yu Jiajun, what's your problem?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.980
Report, Director.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.440
Filing appeals is an inmate's right.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.130
Besides, there's no rule
in the duty regulations

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.130
that prohibits us from
helping inmates file appeals.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.550
The duty regulations don't prohibit you
from eating slop either,

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.080
then why don't you go eat it?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.920
What exactly is going on between you two?

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.650
Explain yourselves right now.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.690
Not talking? Fine.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.080
You're both fired.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.130
You might as well go home
and shoot yourselves!

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.260
I don't want colleagues like you guys.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.880
I don't know what's going on.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.510
He slacks off at work,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.430
always reading his own stuff
during work hours

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.290
and taking time off for no reason.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.060
Zhongwen and I are always the ones
cleaning the dorm.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.260
What's your problem?

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.870
He has an exam coming up,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.160
and his hand is injured.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.500
I can do a bit more work. It's okay.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.170
What's wrong with me doing my own stuff?

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.400
Everyone here is doing their own stuff.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.480
And let me ask you,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.130
who would take the prison administrator
as their first choice?

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:56.750
We all came here

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.810
because we had no other choice, okay?

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.710
Why are you always targeting me?

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.130
Does my studying bother you?

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.840
If you want to complain,
why not complain about Shun?

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.770
He hides away reading comics every day.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.910
Why don't you go after him?

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.380
Shun reads those comics to improve

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.240
his table tennis skills
with those attack techniques.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.680
What are you trying to say?

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.800
-Your exam is over, isn't it?
-What do you think I'm trying to say?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.910
Now that your exam is over,
you should make up for your missed work!

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.880
I failed my exam!

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:18.790
You hurt my hand so badly
that I couldn't even finish my exam paper.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.790
Are you happy now?

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.050
I've been taking this exam for 5 years.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.000
My high school juniors
have all passed the exam,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.750
but I still haven't.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.430
Do you know how much pressure I'm under?

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.330
My brother is a judge
and my sister is a lawyer.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.170
I can't even speak at home
without being criticized.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.230
Do you understand?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.530
Have you got nothing better to do?

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.080
How long do you take to eat?

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.900
Do you deserve to rest?

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.460
I didn't have my lecture notes with me,

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.540
and my anxiety acted up again.
Did you know that?

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.510
Do I have to tell you everything?

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.360
My whole family thinks
I'm wasting my time.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.780
Everyone here thinks I'm wasting time too.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.300
I'm not taking the exam anymore.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.100
I'll just be a corporate slave.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.050
I'll just be a worthless maggot.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.290
I don't care if you want to be a maggot
or eat slop,

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.420
that's your choice.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.500
But working here,

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.250
everyone has their own responsibilities.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.620
Just do your job properly.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.980
Is mutual respect really that difficult?

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.610
It's great that you're studying
to become a lawyer.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.250
And if you want to help the inmates
write appeals,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.670
that's also your choice.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.630
But for such a tiny, trivial matter,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.670
they're just
making random complaints,

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.730
and you're just helping them write
whatever they want?

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.630
Yu Jiajun.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.060
Starting today, you'll be assigned to
the watchtower.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.719
Think about what you've done.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:45.690
Gao Zhiyao,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.190
you'll take over his duties today.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.920
Don't expect to
get off work on time, either.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.880
Come on, calm down.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.330
It's okay.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.150
No need to say such harsh things.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.880
It's alright. It's alright.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.200
The Central District Prison

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.210
was converted from a military prison.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.830
The most haunted place is

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.500
the northeast watchtower.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.440
They say there was a soldier

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.660
whose girlfriend cheated on him.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.140
He couldn't take it
and jumped from that watchtower.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.360
That soldier's spirit still lingers,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.940
haunting that watchtower.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.380
At midnight,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.130
you can hear footsteps going up and down.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.130
Sounds of someone walking upside down.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.750
And constant sobbing sounds.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.430
Crying

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:20.850
and wailing endlessly.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:21.650
Password!

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.970
Crying endlessly.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.670
Password!

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.380
Amitabha.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.630
Amitabha.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.880
Amitabha.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:51.000
Amitabha!

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.660
Are you crazy or what?

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.280
What?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.170
Why didn't you answer
when I asked for the password?

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.000
I just

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.720
choked on the pepper
from the chicken cutlet.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:19.550
Password!

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:25.060
Here, have this.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.460
You can be angry,

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.880
but don't take it out on
the chicken cutlet.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.570
No need!

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.940
Can I drink your water?

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.380
Help yourself.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.250
Thanks.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.250
Why are you here?

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.130
I came to talk to you about something.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.550
If you're still upset after hearing it,

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.910
I'll leave right away.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.130
Go ahead.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.060
You said you took the exam 5 times.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.190
Is there anyone
who's taken it more than you?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.570
So you came here to
pick fights with me again?

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.770
What I wanted to say is

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.380
I used to practice taekwondo.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.380
I gave up after one serious injury.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.750
But you tried for 5 years. That's 5 times.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.590
I think you're really strong.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.500
I mean it.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.990
So your foot injury is really bad?

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.340
My foot...

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.750
The doctor said
it would take 2 years of rehab.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.170
At first, I thought 2 years
wasn't too bad.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.200
But then I saw my juniors and seniors
all making progress.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.630
I...

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.160
Had no choice but to give up.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.950
My mom even borrowed money

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.200
so I could get better faster with rehab,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:03.660
yet I threw tantrums at her.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.030
I went gambling

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.940
and got buried in debt.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.130
It completely ruined my life.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.500
Are you...

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800
Really giving up?

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.480
I don't know.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.040
Haven't thought about it yet.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.050
If you're giving up

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.550
your dream because of me,

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.130
I'll feel guilty.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.130
Really.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.380
You're not that noble.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.360
My dad passed away when I was very young,

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.950
so my mom wanted me to
learn taekwondo well

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.230
to protect myself.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.580
So I took it more and more seriously.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.610
While my classmates
were dating, watching movies,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.400
and going on trips,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.500
I was always practicing taekwondo.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.750
I completely understand that feeling.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.550
Really.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.380
So I was thinking later

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.130
I'm probably the one
in this whole Central Prison

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.790
who understands you the best.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.130
Trying so hard yet getting nowhere
in the end.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.710
It really sucks.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.000
Don't take it out on the chicken cutlet.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.500
Actually...

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.210
Water! Water!

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.530
There's really way too much pepper
on this.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:26.990
Actually,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.380
when my brother was helping me
cram for the exam,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.460
I already knew I had no chance.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.060
So

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.580
when I got hurt, I thought

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.630
I could blame everything on you.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.630
That would make me feel better.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.380
Are you crying?

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.400
It's because this thing you bought
is too spicy.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.500
Actually,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
it's really hard to blame it on others,
isn't it?

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.870
You guys are such cowards.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.000
You almost scared me to death.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.400
Why do you both love scaring people
so much?

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.730
No, it's just...

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.780
Zhiyao said he wanted to make up with you.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.310
I followed because
I was worried you'd fight.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.190
Idiot.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.800
Why do you have chicken cutlets?

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.630
Can I have a bite of yours?

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.550
Only one bite.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.290
Thanks.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.630
Can I take a big bite?

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.290
Sure. The bigger, the better.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.500
Director.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.880
Director.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080
Hello, Director.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.880
Gao Zhiyao, congratulations.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.660
Li Chengbing is withdrawing his complaint.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.490
Really?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.060
Congratulations.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.540
Jiajun.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.490
Are you still planning to
take the bar exam?

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.630
Still thinking about it.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.000
You can't just think about it.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
We're really short on lawyers here.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.360
What happened?

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.260
Shui has a complaint filed by an inmate.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.040
That case

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.130
went straight up to
the deputy commissioner.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:18.500
They're considering how to punish him.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.750
He might end up retiring early
if we can't handle this well.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.250
What's the complaint for?

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.200
When he was putting shackles on an inmate,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.330
he pinched his skin.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.750
And now they're charging him with assault.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.550
As if just breathing the same air
as them is a crime.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:35.220
[Central Desk]

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.500
These days,

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.630
they'd start screaming
even if we touch them lightly,

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.630
and they'd start
talking about human rights.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.230
So what are we supposed to do?

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:44.630
You know what?

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.250
Those inmates

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.000
are all studying law in there
during their free time.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.380
They know the law even better than we do.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.040
What should we do, Mr. Lawyer?

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.740
Figure something out.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.750
Me?

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.310
Help me take a look.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.080
First of all,

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.960
the Prison Management Act states

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.080
that when administrators
are performing their duties,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.210
if they face interference,

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.330
they can cite
disruption of prison security

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:11.960
as grounds for action.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.220
So what should I do now?

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.840
His reason for the claim,

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.330
that "the administrator spoke too harshly"

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.040
is complete nonsense.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.420
How could that possibly hold up?

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.830
Just write a defense statement
and submit it.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.340
But I don't know how to write it.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.420
It's simple.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.630
I'll write it for you, Shui.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.760
You'll write it for me?

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.390
Sure.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.270
Lawyer Jiajun.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.210
I confiscated
an inmate's cigarettes,

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.230
he's now charging me with something called

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.140
"embezzlement in the line of duty."

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:32.890
Jiajun.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.900
A few days ago, an inmate supposedly

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.680
touched my butt.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.710
I don't know if it was intentional or...

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:37.500
Wait, why are you again...

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.080
Either he touched you or he didn't.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.190
What do you mean by "supposedly"?

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.010
-I don't know.
-Alright, Junior.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.920
His case is in the future tense,
while mine is ongoing.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.060
Mine is more serious.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.790
You have to help me, okay?

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:46.580
What exactly does
"embezzlement in the line of duty" mean?

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.210
Wait a moment.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.580
So who wants to go first?

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.580
Me first, of course.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.210
Let Shui go first, then me.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.210
I'm about to be forced to retire.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.710
Okay, Shui first.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:54.770
So now we need to...

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.770
Regarding the inmate's appeal,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.280
we raised 4 substantive defenses

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.240
that are inconsistent with
the objective facts.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.920
Then Director Xiao submitted
the defense statement to Chief,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.720
who then submitted it to
the deputy commissioner.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.110
Do you know that Shui was super happy?

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.170
He referred to me as

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.460
the legal officer of the Custody Division.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.710
Wow.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720
Big-shot lawyer.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.530
I feel like you've changed.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.830
Really?

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:22.960
How so?

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.530
Just now when you were talking about work,

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.390
I noticed you seemed happier.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.630
I am really happy.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.580
That's great.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.010
But honestly,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.220
this time after the exam,
something felt different.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.280
What's different?

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.850
Even though I failed again
and my dad yelled at me as expected,

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.970
I feel like I've become immune
to his criticism,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.400
like it doesn't affect me anymore.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.270
So your dad is strict with you?

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:50.270
Very.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.900
Whenever I fail an exam, he scolds me,

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.520
until I pass.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.580
Only my brother really supports me.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.240
Although he nags a lot too.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.920
Brothers are all like that.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:01.710
Mine too.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.210
You also have a brother?

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.430
Well, my brother...

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.950
Went free diving and never came back.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.230
Got eaten by fish.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:09.600
Out.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.660
Anything else you want to order?

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.520
Hurry up. The kitchen's closing.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.590
No.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.370
Good.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.130
Yay! Time to go home.

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.960
Xiaohui, hurry up. I'm leaving.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.360
Okay. I'll come help you in a minute.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.610
Be careful not to get eaten by fish.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.740
That thing I broke last time...

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.700
It wasn't a gift from your brother,
was it?

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.400
I'm so sorry. I had no idea

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.560
it was so important.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.140
I didn't mean to break it.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.390
It's okay.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.140
Finish this drink and we're even.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:42.640
Really?

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.670
One more point.

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.380
Zhiyao, steady now.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.270
How was that? Cool, right?

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.940
Cool.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.080
Come on! 9-all.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080
If you can't get it done...

00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.670
Focus!

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:00.920
Get ready to pay a 5% interest.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.080
Focus!

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.880
"If you can't get it done,
get ready to pay a 5% interest."

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.050
What does that mean?

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.720
It's related to loans?

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.710
Hello, Junior. Did you find it?

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.660
Yes.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.860

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:27.920
Yeah.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.530
Thanks. You police are really efficient.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.380
Not a problem.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.680
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.280
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.
