00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.110
Tae Kyung!

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.080
Tae Kyung, wake up!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.880
Tae Kyung...

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.160
Tae Kyung, stay with me.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.500
Please wake up!

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.970
Tae Kyung...

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
Mi So.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.980
Mi So.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.550
Mi So!

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.430
- Mom.
- Yes, Mom's here.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.590
I'm right here.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.830
Do you recognize me?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.530
It's you, Mom.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.110
Mi So.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.550
Mi So.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.390
Tae Kyung, please wake up.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.890
Tae Kyung!

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.130
Is this 911?
Please send an ambulance. Hurry!

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.810
(Episode 116)

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.840
Welcome, Chairman.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.180
Are you feeling any better?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.480
Father, are you sure you should be leaving
the hospital so suddenly?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.050
Who gets discharged
in the middle of the night?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.320
I know.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.160
If you'd called ahead,
we would have come to get you.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.590
Why did you suddenly leave the hospital?
You still look like you're in pain.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.000
Why? Am I not welcome in my own home?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.760
Why? Is something wrong?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.070
Still, you'd be better off
at the hospital.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900
So you're fully discharged?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.270
You won't be
returning to the hospital, right?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.340
You still seem to have trouble walking.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.110
Maybe we should check you
in rehabilitation...

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.110
Enough!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.040
Where is Lucia?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.080
She hasn't come home yet.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.350
What could she be doing out this late?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520
Take me to my room.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.040
How could he do this to him?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.680
He's not even human.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.680
I will never forgive you for this,
Min Doo Sik.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.560
Seriously, where is she?
What could she be doing at this hour?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.260
Good grief.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.870
Hey, where are you?

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.410
Why are you calling me?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.910
What's with the attitude?
Can't I call you?

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.650
Come home right now. I'm already here.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.150
I can't right now.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.490
Why not?
Where are you, and what are you doing?

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
I'm in a foul mood because we lost
that jerk Moon Tae Kyung today.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.360
I don't need this from you too.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.600
You're in a foul mood...

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.160
because you couldn't catch him?

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.830
So no matter what,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.300
you're going to find him, aren't you?

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.710
Of course I am.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.040
That little rat.
Does he think he can hide from me?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.510
I'll spend whatever it takes
and hire people and find him.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.150
And what will you do when you find him?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.450
Are you seriously asking me that?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.760
Before that jerk comes for my head
to avenge his father,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.390
I need to finish him first.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.900
I don't care where and what you're doing,
but come home now.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.760
I need you here with me.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.100
Fine.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.510
You're all monsters!

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.580
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.150
Do you have any idea
how much this stuff costs?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.760
A living national treasure made that vase!

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.390
- Hey!
- Come on, stop it already!

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.660
At this rate, you'll destroy everything.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.560
They were all imported!

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.830
They're worth more than
what an average person makes in a year!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.740
That vase over there
is worth 100,000 dollars!

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.700
Money!

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.470
Is money the only thing you care about?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.580
You don't care if people live or die.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.680
As long as you save your own skin
and have more than everyone else.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.380
Then you can just live like kings,
and that's all that matters.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.450
If you're drunk, go sleep it off!
Why are you being so disgraceful?

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.550
I'm not the disgraceful one, you are!

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.660
You think your money lets you do anything.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.520
You're not even human!

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.000
What in the world has gotten into you?
Are you insane?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.870
I've never been more sane in my life.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.400
You're the one
who's lost his mind, Chairman.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.210
What?

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.610
I can't believe you!

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.210
Why do you live like this?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.710
How can you live
like you're not even human?

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.120
You know, a real human being
should feel a pang of guilt...

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.950
when they kill an insect.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.690
They feel guilty even for a tiny creature.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.260
So how could you do that
to another human being?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.860
How could you have someone beaten
to within an inch of their life?

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.740
All for your disgusting greed
and your filthy selfishness!

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.910
Do you have any idea...

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.570
how many innocent lives you've ruined?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.580
All because of you, Min Doo Sik!

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.110
She's gone completely insane.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.750
She absolutely lost her mind!

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.720
What are you all standing around for?
Call the police now!

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.420
Go on, call them
if you've done nothing wrong.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.520
If you can tell your children
what you did...

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.960
to Tae Kyung's parents 30 years ago,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.790
then by all means, call the police.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.800
Why would you destroy
an honest, hardworking family?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.670
Why?
He could've had a happy life with them.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.970
Why did you turn him into an orphan?
Just why?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.850
Was destroying his parents not enough?
Did you have to go after him too?

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.680
You...

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.850
are a monster.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.820
Tae Kyung has been
taking it easy on you until now.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.620
But from now on, just you watch what I do.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.830
I'll drag all of you down to rock bottom
and crush you completely.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.630
I'll make you experience
a living nightmare.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.950
What was that?

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.190
What on earth was that?

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.450
Seriously, what's with her?

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.030
I know, right? Can she just
wreck the place and walk out?

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.060
Father! What's wrong with her?

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.130
You have to know
why she's acting like this!

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.210
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.590
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.760
(Han Kyung Soo)

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.480
You have to wake up,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.790
like none of this ever happened.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.920
You can do that, can't you?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.360
You'll wake up perfectly fine...

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.860
with a smile on your face, right?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.200
I have faith in you, Tae Kyung.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.750
What happened? This place is a wreck.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.950
What took you so long?
Chaos erupted here.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.320
What happened?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.290
That woman smashed the place up
and stormed out.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.960
Lucia did?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.930
She seemed completely out of her mind.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.270
She'd completely snapped.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.270
She looked absolutely murderous.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.270
The chairman is in shock too.
He's just sitting there, stunned.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.410
Father is home?

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.280
Yes. He got home from the hospital.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.750
And he walked right into this mess.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.230
What are you doing here?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.570
You just left the hospital
and came home without saying a word.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.410
What in the world happened?

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.380
I heard Lucia tore the house apart
and left.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.650
You must know why, Father.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.680
Get out.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.420
- Father!
- I said, get out.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.930
(Mingang Distribution)

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.700
The doors are closing.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.070
Just a minute!

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.680
(Mingang Distribution)

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.720
Just the person I wanted to see.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.290
I was just on my way
to the chairman's office.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.760
What was all that about yesterday,
trashing the house before you left?

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.440
So, does this mean you're gone for good?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.140
Then again,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.040
after the scene you made,
how can you possibly return?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.880
My father was in such shock
that he didn't sleep a wink all night.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.750
What will you do if something
happens to him because of you?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.580
He's just lying in bed,
refusing to eat or drink.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.150
Don't you feel the least bit sorry?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.290
Hey.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.460
Are you just going to ignore me?

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.060
(Mingang Distribution)

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.470
How dare she...

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.910
You have some nerve,
acting like this after what you did.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.980
Tell me what happened!

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.450
Why did you cause my family harm
like a thug?

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.790
Why is everyone in the Min family
such a bunch of hypocrites?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.790
Why are you all so selfish?

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.560
What are you talking about?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.400
You have no idea
how other people see you, do you?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.830
Monsters who'd sell their souls for cash.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.340
Are you done?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400
No, I've got plenty more to say...

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.540
about how disgusting and vile you all are.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.380
If I were to list everything,
it would probably take days.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.850
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.550
The father is a monster,
and so is every child of his.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.920
You're nothing but greedy,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.920
and you'd stab your siblings in the back
just to get a little more.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.420
If you despise him this much,
why did you marry my father?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.360
You really haven't figured that out yet?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.260
Because it was the only way
I could get what I wanted.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.860
You mean Mingang Distribution?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.030
- Do you finally get it?
- Get out right now!

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.610
Mingang was built by the Min family,
the people you claim to despise so much.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.640
My father built this company
from the ground up.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.750
This company is Father's life's work!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.280
Don't be delusional!

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.280
Mingang doesn't belong to you.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.020
It has a rightful owner,
and until it's returned to them,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.520
I'm not going anywhere.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.760
No.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.530
I refuse to leave!

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.680
Where am I?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.190
It looks like a hospital.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.190
Why am I here?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.730
How did I get here?

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.570
Tae Kyung!

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.540
Tae Kyung, wake up.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.880
So, she's the one who brought me here.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.610
(Han Kyung Soo)

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.850
(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.950
(Party A: Oh Pan Sool,
Party B: Han Kyung Soo)

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.420
Why is this here?

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:35.930
Is Director Moon not here again?

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.100
Beats me.
Does he think the company's a playground?

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.010
He shows up when he feels like it
and skips it when he doesn't.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.770
Do you have any idea
what's going on with him?

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.210
We're not exactly friends.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.910
Besides, things at my house were a mess,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.980
so I'm in no mood to worry about him.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.320
Is that woman and Director Moon...

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.760
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.360
Don't stop there.
What about her and Director Moon?

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.360
He always does this.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.870
Is it true my stepmother did this?

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.500
Why would we lie about it?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.040
That makes no sense.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.240
Why would she trash the house and leave?

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.780
I know, right?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.280
She must have completely lost her mind.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.950
She must hold a serious grudge
against this family.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.980
That's ridiculous.
What grudge would Mom possibly have?

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.520
You didn't see what happened yesterday,
so you have no room to talk.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.390
My gosh. I'm kicking myself
for not recording the whole thing.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.490
I'm going to go ask Dad.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.130
Please don't.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.560
The chairman is a total wreck right now.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.970
He hasn't even been able
to drink a sip of water.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.070
This is so frustrating.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.100
I have no idea what's going on.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.780
You...

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.950
are a monster.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.850
Tae Kyung has been
taking it easy on you until now.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.660
But from now on, just you watch what I do.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.860
I'll drag all of you down to rock bottom
and crush you completely.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.630
I'll make you experience
a living nightmare.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.510
Anyway, it looks like Tae Kyung
isn't coming home tonight either.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.550
Do you think he ran away
like the young stepmom?

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.320
Wait a minute.
You don't think the two of them...

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.620
This is getting to be just like one
of those crazy soaps I write.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.250
- What?
- No, wait.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.290
Then does that mean Ja Kyung
isn't my real daughter?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.290
Who's the real dad?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.360
Who's the real mom?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.660
- Oh, my.
- Or maybe...

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.560
I'm starting to see
the whole world as a crazy soap opera.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.160
My gosh! I love all the crazy drama!

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.000
For crying out loud.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.350
I was starting to worry
you wouldn't wake up today.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.390
Good thing I woke up, then.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.990
Us being like this
reminds me of that one time.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.360
You know, when I was hospitalized
after I bumped into your scooter,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.970
you kept saying a patient has to eat well,
and you kept bringing me beef bone broth.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.970
I'd never had it in the US,
so I didn't care for the taste back then,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.240
but it really started to grow on me.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.880
Are you craving some beef bone soup?

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.080
And if I am?
Are you going to make some for me?

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.850
No.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.620
I can't right now.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420
Some other time.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.730
I left that house.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.940
Because of this?

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.540
That, and other things.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.250
I was bound to leave
that house eventually.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.150
If anything,
I stayed there for far too long.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.520
This is all my fault.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.690
I...

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.960
don't need this anymore.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.530
I don't want you risking yourself
just to get this for me.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.860
I wasn't in any danger.
I didn't steal it. I took what's mine.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.030
If any problems arise,
I'll take full responsibility.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.340
That's exactly my point.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.670
I don't want you taking
responsibility for everything.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.740
I'm doing this because I want to.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.650
Because if our roles were reversed,
I know you'd do the same for me.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:43.980
Wouldn't you?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.320
Of course I would.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.390
See?

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.050
We feel the same way, Tae Kyung.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.260
So let's not feel sorry for each other.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.330
I should check out of here tomorrow.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.500
I can't bear leaving you
at the company alone.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.850
I had a bad feeling about her
from the start.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.190
A nobody who deliberately got close
to Father,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.120
became his new wife,
then the CEO of Mingang Distribution,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.490
and now, she's even the acting chairman.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.760
Talk about a rags-to-riches story.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.870
Now that she's got what she wanted,
she's showing her true colors.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.330
It sounds more like a story of betrayal.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.870
I can't forgive her.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.270
All the horrible things she said to me,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.240
the contempt she showed my family,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.080
and her greed, daring to covet Mingang.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.780
I will never forgive her for any of it.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.050
What are you going to do now?

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.020
I'll make her divorce Father...

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.320
and kick her
out of the company immediately.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.470
How's Father?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.000
He's the same.
He refused to eat again today,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.810
and he's just holed up in his bedroom.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.390
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.790
Do you know what that woman
said to me today?

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.800
She said she married you
just to steal Mingang Distribution.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.270
The Min family business that you built
with your own blood, sweat, and tears.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.110
She deliberately got close to you
just to gobble it all up!

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.280
That's enough! Darn it!

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.610
Please snap out of it!

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.950
Father, you were completely fooled by her!

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.160
Are there still no signs
of Moon Tae Kyung?

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.760
Then go to the police.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.200
Why do you keep coming here?

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.330
He's in the hospital right now.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.300
Is he that seriously hurt
that he had to be hospitalized?

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.470
It's a miracle he didn't get
emergency surgery.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.140
And let me guess,
Min Doo Sik was behind it?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.710
Yes.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.180
So I declared war on the family
and walked out.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.950
When I saw Tae Kyung lying on the street,
beaten to a pulp,

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.050
I was about to lose my mind.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.060
Madam Jang, I'm going to make them pay.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.120
Please help me.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.200
Then what about Se Ri?
Are you just going to leave her there?

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.860
The person you called is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.830
What is this, seriously?

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.900
Why isn't Mom picking up?

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.640
My goodness. What are you doing back here?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.070
Did you forget to break something
on your way out?

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.290
After today, I am never seeing you again
for the rest of my life.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:47.560
What are you doing here?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.660
Are you here to say your final goodbye?

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.490
I don't need it.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.500
I'm not here to say goodbye.
I'm here to settle the score.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.370
Settle the score?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.600
Settle what score?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.710
You're like a nine-tailed fox
who seduced a chairman your father's age.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.080
Being called the chairman's wife
and treated as such should've been enough.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.650
You shameless vixen.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.050
You're one to talk about
being shameless, Chairman.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.520
You think I'm going to
let you get away with this?

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.350
Not a chance.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.560
I'll expose you for who you really are,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.160
have you thrown in jail
for marriage fraud,

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.990
and I'll make sure the world never forgets
what a gold digger you are.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.330
You're laughing?

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.800
How dare you laugh at me?

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.470
You little...

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.250
Darn you.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.740
Because you've always been surrounded
by people who let you walk all over them,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.240
you've lived your life worshipped
like a king or even the Almighty,

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.310
but that's not how the world really works.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.450
You reap what you sow.
It's a fundamental principle.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:22.050
If you didn't want to end up like this,
you shouldn't have treated them that way.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.920
Did you come here to teach me a lesson?

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.920
Are you here to lecture me
about "real-world experience?"

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.630
No. I still have a lot more to say...

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.100
if you and your family are going
to truly learn your lesson.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.770
So, for starters, how about this?

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.180
This is a memorandum stating
you'll transfer all of your shares to me.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.920
Sign it.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.490
Are you insane?
You think I'd give you all my shares?

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.920
Wasn't it enough you played me for a fool?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.260
And what now?
You want me to hand everything over?

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.500
The death of CEO Han Kyung Soo
of Doeun Industries.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.300
I suppose you don't mind
if the truth about that gets out?

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.440
Do you have proof?

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.240
However much you cry and make a scene
about how you've been wronged,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.340
your words alone won't beat me in court!

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.350
I'll hire the best lawyers
from the top firm in Korea,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.150
and they will bury you.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.120
I'm calling the police right now
to have you arrested.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.590
A thing like you deserves to rot in jail!

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.160
I suppose
this is more than enough proof, then?

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.900
(New Technology Transfer
and Usage Rights Security Agreement)

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.940
You think this flimsy,
old piece of agreement is a threat?

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.510
You really don't know how the world works,
do you?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.310
With enough money,
I can make something like this disappear.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.020
Is this the police?

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.360
There's an intruder in my house...

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.260
What about your handkerchief
with Jo Pil Doo's blood on it?

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.560
That would change things, wouldn't it?

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.820
