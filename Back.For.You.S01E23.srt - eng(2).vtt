00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.120
This matter finally has a resolution.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.000
We can give Su Ruo an explanation now.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.840
If Ren Nan hadn't been with Su Ruo,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.960
maybe things wouldn't have turned out
like this.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.400
Su Ruo didn't get into college.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.400
She doesn't have any family.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.840
She's been struggling alone
all these years.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.640
She met Ren Nan at that time.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400
Actually, back in school,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.520
Ren Nan was always good to Su Ruo.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.720
So many years have passed.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520
It's normal for her to be moved.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.200
Back in high school,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.880
no one would have thought

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.520
Ren Nan would become like this.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.240
Yeah.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.960
Who could've guessed?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720
Ren Nan would actually two-time.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.840
Su Ruo has always taken relationships
seriously.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.680
Once she chooses someone,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000
she'll stick with them wholeheartedly.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200
But if she finds out she's been lied to,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.560
she'll leave without hesitation.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.360
In this matter,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.720
Su Ruo didn't do anything wrong.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.080
She didn't interfere in anyone else's
relationship.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.560
She's still the girl we know.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.160
I suggest you let it go too.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.520
After all, it's already happened.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.120
There's nothing we can do

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320
to change what's done.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.600
What if it could be changed?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
The food's pretty good.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200
Dad said

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.440
you could cook back in high school.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.960
Bro,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.800
what are you thinking about?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.800
Let me ask you something.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.080
If you were hurt by a scumbag,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.680
and now you had a chance

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.200
to go back fifteen years,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.000
is there any way

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to tell yourself

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.400
not to get involved with that scumbag?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080
Probably not.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.880
I was really stubborn in middle school.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.520
The more you told me not to,
the more I wanted to do it.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.680
Seems like I'm the same.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.040
Is there any way

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.280
to stop them from ending up together
fifteen years later?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.600
Class President,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.960
is there a better solution
to this problem?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.080
For this problem,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.280
it's not about having a best solution.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.240
You just did it wrong.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.280
What's up with you lately?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.040
You're so distracted.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.560
I'll go back and check it carefully.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.880
Su Ruo,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.360
come take a walk with me.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.560
Sure.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
Twenty-nine days.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.160
Another month has passed.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
Only one month left until the exam.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.960
I think whatever happens,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.200
just put it aside for now.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.880
Deal with everything after the exam.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.760
Mm-hmm.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.160
I know, I'm fine.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.160
You've been really unfocused lately.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.680
If something's on your mind,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.080
say it now.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.000
For example,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.440
Yu Xingchen,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.960
Yang Yue...

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.760
You're gossiping now too?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.200
I'm not gossiping.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.680
As Class President,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.760
I should care about everyone's
pre-exam mindset.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.440
It's my duty to pay attention.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.360
Isn't it?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.160
There are things I don't know
how to say.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.160
If you can't say it to me,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.080
what about to him?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.720
You two talk first.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.920
I'll head back to class.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.560
Long time no see.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.200
You were gone for a long time
this time.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.240
Was it serious?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.880
Didn't seem that long.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.160
Last time, it was from

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.880
December last year to April.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.560
That's a four-month gap.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.000
This time, it's less than a month.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.320
Really?

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.720
It felt like a long time to me.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.720
By the way,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.000
while you were gone,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.800
the other you was really focused too.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.800
Grades improved a lot.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.880
Gaokao is coming soon.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.320
Now that you're back, study hard too.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.320
Sorry.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.720
I'm the only one talking.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.760
Do you have something to say to me?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.120
Yes.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.200
I'll be direct then.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.600
Don't you think besides studying hard,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.000
it's important to see people clearly too?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.280
I don't think you're being that direct.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.160
What are you trying to tell me?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.400
For example,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.680
if a guy really likes you in the future,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.320
but you don't like him,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.120
he treats you well,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.960
would you

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.160
accept him?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.040
No.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.160
I don't like him.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.360
Why would I accept him?

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.720
Then suppose

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.560
you're having a tough time then,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.200
but he's always helping you,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.800
would you be moved by him?

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.880
I'd remember all his kindness.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.760
Then find a chance to repay him.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.800
But not to the point of giving myself
to him.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.280
Anyway,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.960
if this guy shows up in the future,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.520
you

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.560
don't accept him.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.560
Didn't I say from the start,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.080
I won't get together with someone

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.560
just because I'm moved.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.480
What about dating?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.640
It's just one month.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.760
Hang in there.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.000
Look, my leg's like this and I still
come to class.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.720
Model student.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.560
Zhang Xun, will you ever stop?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.360
You have one month left.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360
You're here to review.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.000
Go home and get ready for Gaokao retake.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.360
I know that better than you all.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.320
I'm just here to mess with your studying.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
I'm leaving now.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.880
Bye.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.920
Did I really disturb you guys?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.600
You know it too.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.720
I thought you were actually dumb.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.760
If you weren't moved by emotion

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.040
when you got together with Ren Nan,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.800
then you must truly love him in the future.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.720
But I can't just tell you directly

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.440
that Ren Nan in the future

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.080
is someone who two-times.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.280
Thank you, Ren Nan.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.200
It was supposed to be Zhang Xun's turn

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.880
but he's not available right now.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.080
It's fine.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.640
Zhang Xun.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.600
This favor isn't for free, you know.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.920
You owe me bubble tea, got it?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.840
Besides, Ren Nan now

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.000
is such a good kid.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.400
There's a guy who really likes you,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.600
treats you well,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.760
helps you in all sorts of ways,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.120
but you don't like him.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.120
Would you ever accept him?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.840
Yu Xingchen,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.120
that's a weird question.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.040
Yeah.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.080
I don't know why he's asking, either.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.160
Maybe

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.480
the guy he's talking about is himself?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.280
Sounds about right to me.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.560
Likes you, helps you all the time...

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.720
But Su Ruo,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.320
you don't like Yu Xingchen, do you?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.160
No.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.680
So, would you accept him?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.600
No.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.560
I think you two should talk things out

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.200
and clear things up soon.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.960
Otherwise, it'll affect your exam focus.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.560
Mm.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.400
I think The Big Four aren't handsome at all.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.200
I agree.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.440
Looks like Ren Nan's my only option.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.640
Ren Nan.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.640
Let's talk for a bit.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.280
About Su Ruo.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.880
Just say what's on your mind.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.800
Let me think how to put it.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.240
Okay, I'll go first.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.440
About that time I splashed water on you—

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.720
I acted impulsively.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.880
Sorry about that.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.600
Oh.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.960
It's fine.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.120
Can I discuss something with you?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.640
Could you stop chasing Su Ruo?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.600
Sure.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.040
I've thought it over.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.880
Who Su Ruo likes is her own business.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880
It's not about you.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.440
I won't pursue her for now.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.880
That's the right attitude.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.600
Your top priority now is the Gaokao.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.280
You know that, right?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.160
Right, can't disturb her studies.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.480
I'll go after her after the Gaokao.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.400
I'm serious about her.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.440
As long as I keep at it,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.320
I'll move her eventually.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.960
One year, two years, fifteen years—

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.560
she'll be moved by me someday.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.520
You really called it.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.200
Don't overthink it.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.720
Just focus on the Gaokao first.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.640
Even if you do badly, you can inherit the company.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.480
It's just about how nice your diploma looks.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.800
You're such a humble brag.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.120
What's a humble brag?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.680
It means you need to be put in your place.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.960
Talking to Ren Nan about this won't work either.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.080
Even if he agrees not to chase Su Ruo now,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.440
how can you be sure

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.200
he won't go after her fifteen years later?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.000
I think I've said before

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.960
I don't have feelings for you.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.720
Don't come looking for me anymore.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.360
Ren Nan.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.600
You now would never imagine

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.360
that you'd so firmly reject Lou Yuting,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.520
but someday you'll compromise and accept her.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
Ren Nan said

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.720
he'll accept Lou Yuting in the future

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.840
because Lou Yuting

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.920
will help his family's company through tough times.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.320
He never liked Lou Yuting.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.800
So even if I try now

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.240
to keep Lou Yuting away from Ren Nan,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.040
I can't guarantee that fifteen years later

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.840
they won't get involved with each other.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.000
What should I do?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.080
Yu Xingchen.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.880
Do you have a minute?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.600
What's up?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.760
My guitar and drum set

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.920
were confiscated by my dad.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.080
They're at his company.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.720
I want to move them out.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.440
My dad's company is close to your place.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.880
So I was thinking—

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.760
could you help me store them at your place for a few days?

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.680
Would that be okay?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.720
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.720
Thinking about it,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.080
I don't really know

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.560
what kind of person Ren Nan is.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.320
This is a good chance.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.440
Sure.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.080
Let's go.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.240
Come on.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.960
A whole day has passed.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.240
Did you clear things up with Yu Xingchen?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.200
I still haven't figured out what to say to him.
