00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.060
Hey.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.040
What's wrong with him?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.300
He's been like that all week.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.250
It's less like he's studying...

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.900
and more like he's trying to clear his head.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.930
Oh yeah?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
(Incoming call from Minato)

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.970
Hello?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.220
You finally picked up.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.460
It's been a while.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.910
Shizuma.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.550
What's the matter?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.010
So cold.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.090
You were so sweet to me before.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.650
Are you still trying to mess with me?

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.720
That's not it.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.080
It's not what you think.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.640
I wanted to apologize properly.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.480
For what I did.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.010
It's in the past.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.250
- If that's all, I'm hanging up.
- Wait.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.010
I haven't...

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080
Please.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.150
I'm begging you.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.060
Just hearing your voice hurts.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.870
Falling for you, believing you so easily...

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.670
I was like a fool being played.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.380
Haven't you had your laugh?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.020
What are you talking about?

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.880
I did make a bet.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.780
But I never wanted to make a fool out of you.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.130
When you were kind to me, I was genuinely happy.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.220
I never intended to keep deceiving you.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.010
Please, believe me on that.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.030
Sorry.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.850
I can't trust you anymore.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.500
(Call ended - Shizuma)

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.000
I brought this on myself.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.610
I wanted to cherish him.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760
And yet...

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010
I ruined it with my own hands.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.000
"Therapy Game"

(Episode 5)

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
Bro.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.690
I'm talking to you...

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360
Oh.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.990
Sorry, what is it?

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.620
Well...

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.330
This.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.720
It was in the bag I lent you yesterday.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.020
Is it yours?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.500
Uh, oh.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.270
It's my friend's.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.920
I thought so.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.390
It's not your style.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.730
Here.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.050
Thanks.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.560
So by "revenge"...

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.540
you meant what happened that night.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.320
What you did to me.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.170
I won't just pretend it never happened.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.550
That night...

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.030
what on earth happened?

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.330
Mom...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Minato-chan...

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
No...

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.650
Don't go...

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.030
Minato?

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Bro.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.060
Having that dream again?

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.130
I'm sorry.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.090
For beling like that on your day off.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.300
Don't be silly.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.520
So you went there to hang out?

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.450
Yeah.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.790
Really?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.050
You used to hate it so much.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.340
How was it?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.880
Did you have fun?

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.010
Well...

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.070
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.380
But I'm not going back.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.010
I see.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.130
Then this...

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.800
- Shohei said he wants to go. Can I have it?
- No.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.310
Hey,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.690
I've noticed something.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880
What?

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.030
Minato.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.130
You're in love, aren't you?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.220
Are you okay?

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.430
I'm fine.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.680
Anyway, bro.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.330
What kind of joke is that?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.140
It's not...

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.220
funny at all.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.010
Stop making that face.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.080
But, looking at you now...

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.160
I'm guessing it's not going well?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.560
It's over.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.260
Because I hurt him.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.030
But it's for the best.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.290
I've had my fun.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.420
This is where it ends.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.040
Nothing good ever comes from
getting involved with people.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.580
I almost forgot.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.340
I told you that's a bad way to think.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.820
- Not everyone is like them.
- I know that.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.380
But I'm scared.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.790
Once I admit I like someone...

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.510
what will I do when I lose them?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.230
What if I get hurt so badly that the pain is unbearable?

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.950
So you just don't let anyone in?

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.950
As long as I have you, bro, that's all I need.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.060
Can I sleep a little more?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.460
Of course.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.450
Get some rest.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.950
He has a cold?

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.050
- Minato?
- Yeah.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.420
I heard he got caught in the rain the day before yesterday.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.460
And has been sick in bed ever since.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.420
The day before yesterday...

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.150
I never intended to keep deceiving you.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.020
Please, believe me on that.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.830
What do you want with him?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.550
- If you have a complaint, take it up with me.
- It's not like that.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.900
It's about the night I first met Minato.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.650
I wanted to ask you about it.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.380
About that night?

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.030
If I really did something
that made him want to get revenge...

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.520
then I can't blame him anymore.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.760
That kid...

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.870
he's especially harsh with people he's just met.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.300
If anyone tries to hit on him,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.630
he'll chase them off like he's about to throw a punch.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.300
But with you, it was different.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.450
Different?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.080
That's right.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.550
You were drinking next to him,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.540
and you suddenly started comforting him.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.850
I thought he'd get mad,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.010
but he actually seemed to be enjoying it.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.070
I don't know what was so funny,

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.130
but he just quietly listened to you ramble on,
drunk as a skunk.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.780
I'd never seen him like that before.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.420
I don't know what happened after you left the bar.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.100
But the next morning,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.500
he said you'd forgotten everything that happened.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.440
He seemed devastated.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.130
That's all I know.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.820
- I'm not sure if that answers your question.
- Um...

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.230
Minato's address...

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.620
could you please tell me?

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.130
It's not that I've sorted out my feelings.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.980
But...

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.550
he lives alone, and I'm worried.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.150
I'll just drop off some food...

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.040
and this, and then I'll leave.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.950
Hello?

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.000
Can I help you?

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.860
Oh.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.000
Could you be...?

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.120
Are you here for our Minato?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.200
(Take care)

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.490
I thought I'd lost this.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Incoming call from Minato)

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.210
You're awake?

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560
Bro.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.710
- Did Shizuma come by?
- Shizuma?

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.090
Oh, so the guy who came to see you is named Shizuma.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.960
Huh? What did he say?

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.290
He said he was returning something
you'd left at his place.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.720
Oh, but...

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.400
I think I might have given him the wrong idea.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.460
He left in a hurry, looking pretty flustered.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.210
The wrong idea...?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.390
You did tell him, right?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.520
That you're my brother?

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.170
I didn't.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.340
Because, Minato,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.710
aren't you afraid of getting involved with people?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.490
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.340
I was hoping this would make you
be more honest with yourself.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.190
Minato-san...

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.870
Um...

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.510
That man who was just here, Shizuma...

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.730
Yes.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.390
Minato's boyfriend came to see him.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840
Um...

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.810
My brother's name...

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.870
is also Shizuma.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.060
Huh?

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.430
Minato.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.510
What a beautiful day.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.900
This park is nice, isn't it?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.500
Why do I have to meet that guy's brother?

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.040
I'm the one who took care of you when you were sick.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.850
- Just come with me, please.
- Such a pain...

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.350
You just got over a bad cold.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.330
Oh, there he is.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.230
Sorry for the wait.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.240
- Why?
- Why?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.570
So, where should we go next?

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.560
We can go wherever you want, Shohei.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.000
Hmm...

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.580
Well then, I want to...

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.290
I want to go wherever you want to go, Itsuki-san.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.050
Oh, you.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.070
When did you find out?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.500
The same time you did.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.310
Just now.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.770
Oh.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.070
I heard you came to visit me the other day.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.510
Oh.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.390
Your brother was there.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.810
My brother?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360
Yeah.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.540
He said he's your brother.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.620
- And he said you were asleep.
- What?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.080
Minato-san.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.750
Let's go get something to eat.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320
Huh?

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.320
We're both the younger brothers here.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.140
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey, wait.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.590
Shizuma.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040
Have a seat.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.450
Oh.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.530
Okay.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.060
About your visit the other day...

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.220
Thank you.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.890
Of course.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.090
The reason he got sick...

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.420
It might have been my fault.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.420
That's not true at all.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.080
You took him out on that date, didn't you?

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.560
It wasn't so much me taking him...

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.840
as it was him keeping me company.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.710
He was so grumpy at first.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.070
I can imagine.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.960
Minato's world...

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.810
has been very small since he was a child.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.550
I've always wanted him to see more of the world,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.730
but he's so timid.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.600
About the bet...

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.420
You have every right to be angry.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520
But...

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.940
The Minato you were with, Shizuma...

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.040
Was all of that really a lie?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800
I'm sorry...

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.510
You know...

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.300
Shizuma.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320
I...

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.600
I'm sure some of it was real.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920
My brother...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.420
has been really down.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.060
It's not over between you two.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.060
- But he said he can't trust me anymore.
- Seriously?

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.880
You're just going to back down
because he pushed you away once?

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.560
That's not like you at all.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.870
I'm not backing down.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.920
Right? Good.

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.610
Shohei.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.440
- You've got some cream on you.
- Huh? Where?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640
Right here.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.530
I'm going to get us some drinks.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.210
So cute. Should we take a picture together?

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.120
Yeah, let's. We should ask someone to take it.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.560
Oh, here comes someone.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.970
Oh, excuse me?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.500
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.900
Oh, sure.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.110
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.980
Okay, get a little closer.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.100
Okay, I'll take a few.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.560
Three, two, one.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.050
Three, two, one.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.380
- I think these came out great.
- Thank you so much.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.490
You're welcome.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.870
- Wow, this is perfect!
- You like it?

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.390
- I love it. Thank you.
- Great. If you're not busy...

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.390
why don't you hang out with us?

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.980
- Oh, well...
- Or maybe get your number?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.480
We could exchange numbers?

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.480
- No, thank you.
- This guy here...

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.420
- He's mine.
- Huh?

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.230
Can we go now?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.270
Oh, okay... Um...

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.470
Never mind.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.160
- Sorry about that.
- Let's go.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240
Huh?

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.380
Hey.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.120
I didn't know you could be so assertive.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.850
Well, that's because you were wandering off.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.050
Huh?

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.790
Well...

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.120
Thanks for walking me home.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.690
Yeah.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.070
Minato.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.390
I need to properly apologize to you, too.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.320
You've already apologized to me so many times.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.980
It was wrong of me to push you away
without hearing you out.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.650
You don't have to say you're sorry.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.550
I want you to hold me.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.280
We can skip the foreplay.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.600
No.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.550
Tonight, I want to make you feel good.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400
Minato.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.420
I love you.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.450
Maybe if...

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.140
If I'm with Shizuma,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.470
I can finally get past this.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.880
(Next Episode) My internship finally
starts next week. Will I really be okay?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.680
I didn't mean to fall for him.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.800
But then you'd be lonely, wouldn't you, Minato-san?

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.030
Minato, you're not allowed to look at anyone else.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.560
I'm not going anywhere.
