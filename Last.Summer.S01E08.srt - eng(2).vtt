00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:35.890
When did I start twisting things?

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.684
GLOVE KNITTING PROJECT

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.602
-Take that out.
-Good.

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:42.438
-Great job.
-I made it. Applause.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:43.356
Little kiss.

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:46.109
I don't get them.

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:47.652
There you go.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:48.820
Me too.

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:50.446
Take that.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.490
Hey!

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:53.825
It's twisted. Bring it back.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.411
-Do you want to get in trouble?
-Wow!

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:59.164
Play with your toy, not this.

00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:01.082
When you get to the final stage,

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.168
you have to make a choice.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.879
Just like in this situation.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.422
Here.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:08.756
There are two paths.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:10.675
Will you undo it…

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.636
or just push through it?

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.349
Hey, just undo it and start over,
like I did.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.895
I don't need to.
It'll somehow get done.

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:23.313
At the final moment of choice,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.441
I twisted my own path.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.235
No, let me correct that.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.988
I went my own way.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.116
Hey, is this okay?

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.326
It has six fingers.

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.997
That's my daughter.

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.667
A little twist in life can bring you luck.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.129
That's right.
Once it's twisted, I twist it even more.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.593
Hey, look.

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:56.721
This may look like a normal glove…

00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:00.266
but it has an extra finger.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.602
Hey, what the heck?

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:04.646
When did you take that?

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.564
That's clearly Ha-gyeong's glove.

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.942
What?

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.860
You know nothing about me.

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:14.614
You knew you screwed up,
but you still got it done somehow.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:15.990
I didn't screw up.

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:19.410
That's the day
the Song Ha-gyeong glove came about.

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.536
JONG-MAN

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:24.332
Oh, this?

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.252
You said you couldn't stand
the sight of it, so…

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:29.295
You!

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.215
TWO YEARS AGO

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:34.467
In my 29 years of life…

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.843
38 DAYS AGO

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:37.845
…I've filed two lawsuits.

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.973
SIX YEARS AGO

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:42.809
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM
PRE-MED PROGRAM

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:45.728
After some dramatic career shifts…

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.315
Hello.

00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:55.029
…I got a boyfriend two weeks ago.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:58.908
And now,

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.160
I'm being kidnapped.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.496
Are we going to Busan?

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.498
Shall we?
You like the noodles there, right?

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:10.211
Why don't we have some soju with clams
in Mokpo, while we're at it?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.047
Sounds good. And for you…

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.718
I'll even throw in some yogurt
if you like.

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.803
No, it's just a scratch.

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:23.057
Actually, let's have potato liquor
in Pyeongchang.

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:24.600
I've always wanted to try that.

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.061
Really? Sounds good to me.

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:28.521
Then we're staying overnight.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:29.439
Right?

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.316
Stop the car or I'll call the cops.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:40.950
You seem to be doing all right.

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:44.037
Mr. Jeon is dog-sitting Su-bak,
so don't worry about anything.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.747
Keep your guest company.

00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:48.875
Let's have a blast today.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.842
Hey. Tell me where we're going!

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.813
What are you doing?

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.286
The sea is so beautiful.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.499
I need to call my boyfriend.
Can I borrow your phone?

00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:31.000
The sky's pretty too.

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:34.462
I need to tell my boyfriend to pick me up
since a psycho kidnapped me.

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:38.383
You see that lighthouse?
Let's go there and eat some octopus.

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.220
If you leave me out, we'll go to Namhae.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:47.225
You act like I'm invisible,
so I'm letting you know I'm here.

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:50.269
Let's stay together tonight.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.024
If you twist it, I will too.
It's you and me.

00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:58.778
It looks like you're doing what you can.

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.030
I need to do everything I can, too.

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:11.958
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I borrow your phone?

00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.959
What for?

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:15.378
I'm in a rush. I'll make one quick call.

00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.797
-What is it about?
-I'm--

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:23.845
All twisted up. Twisted donut.

00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:32.854
This donut is perfect for us.

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:34.439
Do-ha.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.316
My hair is starting to turn gray…

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.902
ever since you showed up.

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:43.573
I pulled out two gray hairs,
and I'm only 29.

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.911
Just leave me alone.
You're being obsessive.

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:51.664
Unbelievable.

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:54.834
So I'm a guest, a guy from the past,
and obsessive now?

00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:56.919
Fine.

00:05:57.003 --> 00:05:59.297
We might as well make more nicknames.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.340
What?

00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:07.180
What do you call me now?

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:11.934
Let's go eat octopus.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:15.897
What a nice day.

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:26.782
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.452
Do you think one night's enough
to hear me out?

00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:34.290
Excuse me, ma'am. Can we have one soju?

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:37.210
-Actually, make it ten, please.
-Sure.

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:39.086
You can't drink, you're on meds.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.379
We'll just have yogurt…

00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:44.508
-Ten bottles of soju, please.
-Geez.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.348
You could've ordered one at a time.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.017
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.730
This wound is no big deal.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:01.108
Hey, you…

00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:03.694
Are you insane?

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.115
To deal with a crazy guy,
I have to be crazy too, right?

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:11.619
Hey, you…

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:17.208
Unbelievable.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.961
Let's settle this once and for all today.

00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:24.882
It might be tough to hear what I feel.
Since I see you're trying, I'll tell you.

00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:32.223
Come on.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.102
I'll say it this once.

00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:38.104
Listen carefully.

00:07:45.778 --> 00:07:46.654
Hey, you…

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:51.450
Listen really carefully.

00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:56.581
Fine.

00:07:58.082 --> 00:07:58.958
I…

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:04.046
actually…

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:49.925
I never thought you'd say that.

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:51.302
Had you told me sooner…

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.138
it would've made my decision easier.

00:08:54.764 --> 00:08:56.807
Out of nowhere? What's this about?

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:58.309
I'll think about what you said.

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.062
-What did I say?
-You have a point.

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:02.813
I think I might've overreacted.

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:03.856
Overreacted?

00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:06.651
I'll give you a week, like you said.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:08.986
I'm mature enough for that.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.196
A week for what?

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:13.741
I'm going crazy.

00:09:13.824 --> 00:09:17.036
Don't act like you don't know.
I recorded what you said at the end.

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:19.955
Recorded? What did you record?

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:22.917
What did I tell you?

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:33.135
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.220
Ms. Song.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.766
Attorney Seo.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.775
When did you get here?

00:09:47.858 --> 00:09:49.026
I brought your phone.

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:50.945
Oh, right.

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:00.287
Get in.

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:34.739
How's your arm?

00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:37.700
Not bad.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:42.288
I wanted to chase after you
like back in the day,

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:46.333
but to behave like an adult,
I played tennis instead.

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:54.049
Today, Mr. Baek, who likes you,
kidnapped you right before my eyes.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.178
There's no way nothing happened.

00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:58.095
I…

00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:00.473
blacked out.

00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:04.226
I did.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.189
As you saw this morning,

00:11:08.272 --> 00:11:10.441
Baek Do-ha dragged me to the west coast.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:14.612
I had some octopus,
and since I was so upset and baffled,

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:16.489
I drank a little too.

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:19.366
-You called me too.
-Sorry?

00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:22.119
-Attorney Seo.
-Hey.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:24.914
Attorney Seo!

00:11:24.997 --> 00:11:26.165
ATTORNEY SEO SU-HYEOK

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:29.001
I want to go home.

00:11:32.004 --> 00:11:34.507
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:38.594
Did I cross your mind today?

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:40.679
What?

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:44.725
Did you wish I were there
to eat that octopus with you?

00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:49.355
Or did you wish we saw
the beautiful sea together?

00:11:53.526 --> 00:11:54.860
Shall we go to the east coast?

00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:57.446
-What?
-But…

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:00.616
I have a big meeting tomorrow morning,

00:12:01.742 --> 00:12:03.118
and I'm worried about you.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.123
As mature adults, we should go home.

00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:14.380
Right.

00:12:15.047 --> 00:12:16.131
Where your kidnapper is.

00:12:26.475 --> 00:12:27.351
Here's the thing.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.063
Why hasn't Mr. Baek made a single call?

00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:34.817
Your phone should be blowing up.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.280
Probably because…

00:12:41.365 --> 00:12:43.659
he knows you're coming back home.

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:02.094
Attorney Seo.

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:06.473
Is this for me?

00:13:07.224 --> 00:13:08.142
Help yourself.

00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:13.272
Were you always like this?

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:16.609
I know. I'm just as surprised.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:19.486
Feeling all right?

00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:22.573
All good.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.074
And memory?

00:13:26.243 --> 00:13:28.537
Not yet.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.556
Are you sure?

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:50.392
Yes.

00:13:51.018 --> 00:13:52.269
You really want to…

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:54.229
drop me as your lawyer?

00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:55.898
Yes.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.653
Thanks to you,
I could see my problem clearly.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.618
It was wrong of me to hire you
to drag things out through summer.

00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:11.246
Even one-on-one wouldn't have been enough.

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:15.250
From now on, it's just her and me.

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.753
This was our game from the start.

00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:20.464
But in that game…

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.258
Ha-gyeong chose me.

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:24.385
Exactly.

00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:26.053
That's why…

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:29.014
I think I'll keep breaking the rules.

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:31.100
Because…

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:34.561
you're such a good guy.

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:36.897
I can't help feeling desperate.

00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:41.902
That's why I can't act like an adult.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.863
When it's about Ha-gyeong…

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:47.324
I won't play fair.

00:14:57.376 --> 00:14:58.210
Is it possible

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.796
to adjust the height?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.090
It might hit the knees in a wheelchair.

00:15:03.757 --> 00:15:07.177
There's an additional fee
for switching tables.

00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:09.471
-Is that okay?
-Well, yes.

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:15.686
And there are no bumps on the way
to the reception,

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:17.187
bathroom, and elevator,

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.523
that would get in the way
of a wheelchair, right?

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:22.443
I'll check that for you.
Please give me a second.

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:23.360
Sure.

00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:27.698
You said he didn't propose that day.

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:29.658
Song! Don't jinx it.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:32.369
So you didn't see him that day?

00:15:32.995 --> 00:15:36.999
His mom called.
They've got a primary doctor now.

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.586
While he's at his parents' place,

00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:43.172
I'll do whatever I can on my own.

00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:45.632
Ms. Lee.

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:47.760
-Yes?
-Once you confirm the booking,

00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:50.971
we can install a ramp
that fits the height.

00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:54.808
And this is
the additional charge breakdown

00:15:54.892 --> 00:15:56.393
reflecting your requests.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.814
The deposit is five percent,
five million won upfront.

00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:02.524
Do you want to proceed?

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.450
CHICKEN FEET

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:13.202
The venue fee is ridiculous.

00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:15.913
Should I have given in to temptation?

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:18.707
No, Lee Seul. Get a grip.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.877
Don't give in to temptation.
I decided to start fresh.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:24.588
Start fresh?

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:26.924
I'm done trying to keep everyone happy.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.804
I'm going head-to-head with Grandpa
and setting things straight.

00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:34.598
Gosh, whatever.

00:16:34.681 --> 00:16:36.850
Let's get hammered!

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:38.685
Let's get hammered!

00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:50.531
Wait, what's going on here?

00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:54.993
What is it this time?

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:57.454
Remember that time when I blacked out?

00:16:58.497 --> 00:17:00.290
When you sued the sharp guy?

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.960
When you quit med school?

00:17:04.044 --> 00:17:05.420
What did I get myself into?

00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:07.464
You called Director Jeon

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:11.552
and listed a hundred reasons
why you dumped him.

00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:14.805
After you saw
the civil service exam schedule,

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:16.890
you dropped out,
instead of taking a year off.

00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:20.686
-What did I end up doing yesterday?
-You blacked out?

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:25.065
Why did you drink that much?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.734
To hide it.

00:17:29.236 --> 00:17:31.613
-Hide what?
-My feelings.

00:17:50.883 --> 00:17:53.927
Sir. Wait, sir.

00:17:54.011 --> 00:17:55.387
Where are you headed?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.805
Can you take me with you?

00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:59.183
I need to get away from that jerk.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.727
-She's always like this.
-Sir.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.479
-Sir, where are you headed?
-Where do you want to go?

00:18:04.563 --> 00:18:05.939
To Patan.

00:18:06.523 --> 00:18:07.399
Thank you.

00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:12.362
You remember something?

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:16.033
What on earth happened yesterday?

00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:18.702
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:20.162
Hey!

00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:21.580
I must be crazy.

00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:26.919
You and your drunk talk.

00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:30.547
When you crashed at my place
because of Do-ha…

00:18:32.132 --> 00:18:34.009
you said this to me while you were drunk.

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:35.510
Even if I go back…

00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:39.389
I'll be all alone again.

00:18:44.728 --> 00:18:46.855
He said he recorded what I said.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:49.691
I just can't remember it at all.

00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:51.902
He recorded something?

00:18:54.112 --> 00:18:55.739
Gosh!

00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:13.090
First, get a hold of his phone.

00:19:13.173 --> 00:19:14.675
You need to know before you act.

00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:17.594
It could turn out to be nothing.

00:19:18.637 --> 00:19:19.471
What a bummer.

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:23.350
I'm missing the key ingredients.
Such a bummer.

00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:31.775
Are you making khow suey?

00:19:33.485 --> 00:19:34.611
This is really bad.

00:19:35.362 --> 00:19:38.699
Without the sauce,
the dish won't turn out right.

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:41.576
There's no aji amarillo sauce.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.494
Exactly.

00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:46.290
We'll need to go to Cheontan Food Market.

00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:48.000
It's a 40-minute drive.

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:50.585
Since you have a car, could you help me?

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:53.422
Cheontan Food Market?

00:19:57.801 --> 00:19:58.635
Thanks.

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:05.225
Be quiet.

00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:11.732
ALL RECORDINGS

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:13.567
Here.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.571
We've got harissa, sambal,
piri piri, everything.

00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:20.282
Wait. My phone is gone.

00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:23.452
Oh, here's your phone.

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:25.704
-There it is.
-He tried to lick it.

00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:26.621
Hey! Song Su-bak!

00:20:27.372 --> 00:20:29.291
I told you not to, didn't I?

00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:40.886
I'll make sujebi.
Prepare the broth and dough.

00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:43.096
Mix the flour and water equally.

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:49.061
I'm done cutting. I'm beat.

00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:52.856
Where are the plates?

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:54.733
Plates…

00:20:57.527 --> 00:20:59.446
Plates are in the back…

00:21:05.035 --> 00:21:06.286
The floor is very slippery.

00:21:07.913 --> 00:21:09.414
It must be really clean.

00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:18.715
CIVIL SERVANT ASSAULTED

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.759
Complaints have been up lately.

00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:23.303
But have you seen a site
with no complaints?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.888
Sir!

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.724
Can you take a look
at the pipe connection?

00:21:27.808 --> 00:21:28.725
All right!

00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:31.812
I heard Ms. Song wasn't hurt that badly.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:34.398
It's just an accident.

00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:47.077
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:49.788
I'll think about us as well.

00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:51.415
I never thought you'd say that.

00:21:55.293 --> 00:21:56.128
But, Do-ha,

00:21:56.211 --> 00:21:57.671
I need some time.

00:21:57.754 --> 00:22:01.174
As you know,
I'm seeing Mr. Seo Su-hyeok.

00:22:03.385 --> 00:22:06.513
One week.
Give me one week.

00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:08.515
I'll give you a week, like you said.

00:22:09.766 --> 00:22:11.226
I'm mature enough for that.

00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:12.978
Cheers.

00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:14.479
No way.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:23.697
So annoying. I can't get anything done.

00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:26.032
I can't…

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:28.034
Can't stop thinking about Do-ha?

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:31.788
Gosh, this is crazy.

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:33.373
Song.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:35.792
There's no other way.

00:22:46.678 --> 00:22:47.637
You're back.

00:22:49.431 --> 00:22:52.184
Today, they had a Chobok celebration.

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.103
The women's group president brought these.

00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:58.940
To top it off, some makgeolli.

00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:03.528
So? How about a drink?

00:23:06.698 --> 00:23:07.949
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:18.001
We've never done a proper drink like this
as adults, have we?

00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:19.502
Tell me about it.

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:22.172
You were the only one drinking
the night you blacked out.

00:23:24.174 --> 00:23:26.509
That day, I was in a really fragile state.

00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:28.261
I'd taken some medicine too.

00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:32.098
I've been drinking
with village heads and elders

00:23:32.182 --> 00:23:34.142
in Patan for ten years.

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:37.520
I've been drinking

00:23:37.604 --> 00:23:40.607
with site managers and workers
for ten years.

00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:46.404
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:52.494
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:24:04.965 --> 00:24:06.841
Oh, my, we're out of ice.

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:08.385
I'll go grab some.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:09.886
Yeah.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.019
He can drink a lot.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.274
Song Ha-gyeong, get it together.

00:24:24.734 --> 00:24:26.945
I'm the kind of person
who always has to win.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.033
I'm not losing like this.

00:24:41.668 --> 00:24:42.919
Farewell, Baek Do-ha.

00:24:47.924 --> 00:24:50.302
It's home-made pine-needle liquor
Chief Jo's wanted.

00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:54.055
It's been aging for ten years,
and it's over 35%.

00:25:00.312 --> 00:25:01.521
Why do you want me drunk?

00:25:03.189 --> 00:25:04.024
What do you mean?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.986
-What?
-Are you that curious? A week?

00:25:10.113 --> 00:25:10.947
No, it's just…

00:25:15.118 --> 00:25:16.286
Go ahead and listen.

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:18.038
You can delete it if you want.

00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:22.000
I just wanted to prove
I can hold my liquor

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.460
better than you do.

00:25:23.543 --> 00:25:26.546
Even if we go on like this,
we'll still be sober all night.

00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:30.133
How about a quick game?
Loser has to drink?

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:32.010
Nice.

00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:33.303
I'm good at games.

00:25:33.803 --> 00:25:34.637
Sure.

00:25:35.972 --> 00:25:37.974
I'll get a board game from the basement.

00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:39.351
No need. We've got a game.

00:25:40.643 --> 00:25:41.728
The Song Ha-gyeong game.

00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:43.355
It's called…

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.440
the "Lie Game."

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.407
-No.
-Why not? You're good at this.

00:25:54.491 --> 00:25:56.368
Whoever tells the truth drinks.

00:25:56.993 --> 00:26:00.038
Song Ha-gyeong language.
Speak the opposite. That's your forte.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.124
Scared of losing?

00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:06.378
Fine, never mind.

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:11.341
Let's do it!

00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:12.425
Okay.

00:26:23.228 --> 00:26:27.607
When you said
you'd redo the entire design…

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.317
I hate to admit it…

00:26:30.944 --> 00:26:31.945
but it was pretty cool.

00:26:36.199 --> 00:26:38.535
When I first saw you
in your work clothes…

00:26:39.869 --> 00:26:40.703
you looked awful.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.373
You looked ugly…

00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:45.750
and annoying.

00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.883
To be honest,
whenever you ran in the morning…

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.805
you looked pretty sexy.

00:27:04.394 --> 00:27:06.896
Now that we live together,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.023
I can't handle your bare face.

00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:12.360
When I see you,
no butterflies, no excitement.

00:27:14.112 --> 00:27:15.071
So it's not hard.

00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:19.951
What the…

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:22.287
Was that a lie, or what?

00:27:24.414 --> 00:27:25.415
I've always felt bad…

00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:29.836
about leaving because you said so
two years ago.

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.006
I've always…

00:27:35.133 --> 00:27:36.676
wanted to say sorry for that.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.974
Fine.

00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:46.186
I expected it from you, you jerk.

00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:48.354
I know you don't feel sorry.

00:27:59.073 --> 00:28:00.158
And…

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.083
I've liked you all along.

00:28:12.045 --> 00:28:12.962
And I still do.

00:28:21.763 --> 00:28:25.308
Hey. What was that? Why did you drink?

00:28:26.434 --> 00:28:28.770
We're playing the Lie Game.

00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:31.731
I like you.

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:35.151
I always have and I still do.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.322
I've never not liked you.

00:28:57.674 --> 00:28:58.925
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:29:02.178 --> 00:29:03.346
I like you.

00:29:43.052 --> 00:29:44.762
The cicadas were so loud,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.098
so I'm sure he couldn't hear it.

00:29:57.567 --> 00:29:59.736
PACHEON CITY HALL

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.753
I like you.

00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:42.987
How many times will you count?

00:30:43.863 --> 00:30:45.073
It has to be accurate.

00:30:47.992 --> 00:30:48.826
Chiefs.

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:51.579
-Hey, Dr. Song.
-Hi, there.

00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:57.794
What brings you here?

00:31:04.217 --> 00:31:05.677
-Sir.
-Sir. Here.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.011
-He's finally here.
-What?

00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:10.056
Oh, man. His legs are giving out on him.

00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.725
Take a seat.

00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:14.185
Gosh.

00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:18.940
Unbelievable.

00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:21.484
There's no need to count them.

00:31:23.027 --> 00:31:23.987
Just right.

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:26.614
What is going on? What's this mix?

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:37.667
CONSENT FORM
PATAN-MYEON FENCE REMOVAL PROJECT

00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:46.718
CHA JEONG-SUK

00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:52.098
So what happened was…

00:31:57.395 --> 00:32:00.481
This will collect moisture,
damaging the stone fence.

00:32:00.565 --> 00:32:03.568
Over the past few days,
I've seen the north-facing stone fences

00:32:03.651 --> 00:32:05.361
have cracks from the eroding ground.

00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:08.072
Didn't you see it
when it poured last time?

00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:09.824
The stone fences aren't the problem.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.617
This is basically a wall.

00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:14.996
Good thing Dr. Song fixed the drainage.
Or it wouldn't have lasted.

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.956
-Right?
-Yes.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.041
It's thanks to her.

00:32:18.124 --> 00:32:20.168
So this outer stone-fence problem…

00:32:21.127 --> 00:32:23.254
had nothing to do
with the drainage system.

00:32:28.968 --> 00:32:30.386
Wait, these accidents

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.139
aren't necessarily
because of illegal parking.

00:32:33.222 --> 00:32:35.183
The accidents happened on the same side.

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:38.978
If this were only half as tall,
accidents would be cut in half.

00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:42.648
Ae-jeong had an accident here too.

00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:46.152
-Sorry?
-Dr. Song made a huge fuss

00:32:46.235 --> 00:32:49.030
after her mom's accident,
but she still couldn't take it down.

00:32:49.113 --> 00:32:53.326
Looks like Master Baek has a good eye.

00:32:53.409 --> 00:32:55.495
He seemed to know everyone.

00:32:55.578 --> 00:32:57.955
He could spot every house
that didn't submit the form.

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.791
So, now we need to go down there…

00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:01.959
Is it okay if I go now?

00:33:02.043 --> 00:33:03.795
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:33:07.173 --> 00:33:08.257
Darn it.

00:33:08.341 --> 00:33:12.637
He went door to door
getting consent forms.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.806
One sack, it's the last one!

00:33:16.224 --> 00:33:17.058
Good work.

00:33:18.184 --> 00:33:19.977
Wait. Sign the consent form.

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:23.606
On top of that,
he pushed people to reach their quotas.

00:33:23.689 --> 00:33:26.609
-Stop shaking.
-I can't stop shaking.

00:33:29.737 --> 00:33:33.032
Is Ha-gyeong's dream project
finally accomplished?

00:33:34.617 --> 00:33:38.496
Your mom even created a team
to improve the village.

00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:39.413
Right?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.753
Finally, we're free.

00:33:47.713 --> 00:33:48.756
Still, for us,

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.926
there's no one like Dr. Song.
Dr. Song is the best.

00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:57.014
-Let's have a drink.
-All right.

00:33:57.098 --> 00:33:57.974
This isn't beer.

00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:00.810
Have a seat, Dr. Song.

00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:18.703
I wiped off the oil from the hinge

00:34:18.786 --> 00:34:20.746
to make it rusty again.

00:34:22.206 --> 00:34:23.082
Pretty good, right?

00:34:24.208 --> 00:34:25.168
So the whole time,

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:28.671
all that rambling about Master Baek
was for consent forms?

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.800
Well, kind of.

00:34:35.803 --> 00:34:37.388
You know I have a good memory.

00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:39.432
Being in Patan

00:34:40.016 --> 00:34:41.893
made me remember your complaint.

00:34:43.936 --> 00:34:47.607
"This stone fence
took away the only time

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:49.650
I could hold my mom's hand."

00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:50.610
You hungry?

00:34:50.693 --> 00:34:52.195
How about some tteokbokki?

00:34:53.196 --> 00:34:54.155
"This stone fence

00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:56.908
took away the only time

00:34:57.617 --> 00:34:59.118
I could hold my mom's hand."

00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:04.790
Oh, no.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.667
Are you hurt?

00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:17.470
"If we tear down
the roadside stone fences,

00:35:17.553 --> 00:35:20.348
the road widens,
and if the road widens,

00:35:20.973 --> 00:35:23.017
the town will flourish."
Add a line like that.

00:35:23.935 --> 00:35:24.810
All done.

00:35:56.092 --> 00:35:57.593
Who's fixing who?

00:35:59.136 --> 00:36:00.805
You're always right.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:04.850
The shoe rack, and the fences.

00:36:06.269 --> 00:36:07.603
You're right about everything.

00:36:09.522 --> 00:36:12.692
The architect's ideas and theories…

00:36:13.985 --> 00:36:16.404
were just pretentious. I'll admit it.

00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:21.575
The reason you don't eat in Patan

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.578
is because you remember it everywhere.

00:36:27.623 --> 00:36:28.833
I just want you to know…

00:36:30.793 --> 00:36:32.878
that your past isn't filled with pain…

00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:40.344
and you don't have to throw
everything away.

00:36:42.847 --> 00:36:44.181
I wanted to let you know that.

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:03.117
Are the cicadas louder…

00:37:04.952 --> 00:37:06.829
or is my heartbeat louder?

00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:12.418
Let's ignore it for now.

00:37:18.591 --> 00:37:20.551
Goseong Group's inheritance dispute,

00:37:21.177 --> 00:37:23.637
it's massive
in terms of media attention and scale.

00:37:24.263 --> 00:37:27.683
This case could significantly affect
the group's overall image.

00:37:28.976 --> 00:37:30.061
Attorney Seo, take this.

00:37:31.979 --> 00:37:34.231
Sure, I'll contact
Goseong Group's legal team--

00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:35.691
I mean, Attorney Seo Su-hyeok.

00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:39.362
Na-hyeon.

00:37:43.282 --> 00:37:44.116
Ms. Seo.

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:48.412
Next. A consultant
for Jeju Special Law revision.

00:37:48.913 --> 00:37:51.957
Who wants to go?
Just kill time for three days.

00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:53.751
Babble on the topic all day,

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:56.462
then butter up the politicians
over booze at night.

00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:57.880
Nice and clean.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.095
I'll go.

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:09.308
Instead of the inheritance one,
I'll take the Jeju one.

00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:22.488
1:55 P.M.

00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:24.782
2 P.M.
BUDGET MEETING WITH PLUTO ATELIER

00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:43.175
Let's go.

00:38:43.884 --> 00:38:44.718
Okay.

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:51.642
As for what you mentioned before,
this material might work better.

00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:52.852
Right?

00:38:56.814 --> 00:38:57.690
Ms. Song?

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.067
What?

00:39:06.407 --> 00:39:07.575
Oh, no.

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:10.119
The garden bench I made…

00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.832
Sorry about that.

00:39:20.421 --> 00:39:23.466
Wasn't this the strategy meeting
before the budget meeting?

00:39:23.549 --> 00:39:26.635
That's why we were choosing
the best material for the model.

00:39:27.553 --> 00:39:29.013
That's right.

00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:33.100
I said I'd try to make this model
within a week, right?

00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:35.269
A week?

00:39:35.352 --> 00:39:37.605
We talked about it together back then.

00:39:38.522 --> 00:39:39.356
Back then?

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.610
You said back then
there would be budget problems,

00:39:42.693 --> 00:39:44.153
so we're here for a status check.

00:39:44.236 --> 00:39:45.446
I see.

00:39:49.158 --> 00:39:50.075
There are…

00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:51.911
three days left now.

00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:05.341
Well…

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.637
You said earlier
that we'd talked about it together…

00:40:15.184 --> 00:40:16.685
ATTORNEY SEO SU-HYEOK

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:23.484
Yes, Attorney Seo.

00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:25.736
Ms. Song. Do you have time today?

00:40:29.657 --> 00:40:31.617
Today? Well…

00:40:32.785 --> 00:40:34.203
I don't really have any plans--

00:40:34.286 --> 00:40:35.496
Then come over to my place.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.540
To your place?

00:40:48.759 --> 00:40:49.593
Hey, Jong-shin.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.888
I'm dragging my feet here.

00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:54.348
What is it this time?

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:56.767
It's just some annoying stuff going on.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.145
Take it easy.
The site can keep going as usual?

00:41:00.229 --> 00:41:04.441
Yeah, just lay the concrete for now.
I'm working on the rooftop right now.

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:07.194
-All right. I'll let you get to it.
-Bye.

00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:22.668
What?

00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:24.211
He invited her to his place?

00:41:25.462 --> 00:41:26.380
Mr. Baek.

00:41:27.214 --> 00:41:29.049
Do you still believe in what you said?

00:41:30.384 --> 00:41:35.139
That a house shows how someone has lived
and how they'll live.

00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:39.101
You said
a house reveals the person inside.

00:41:41.228 --> 00:41:42.896
I shouldn't have said that.

00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:05.711
What are these?

00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:12.718
PREMIUM TOILET PAPER

00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:16.472
I thought I was getting
something premium…

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.234
You're here?

00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:31.654
You didn't have to.

00:42:33.113 --> 00:42:33.947
Thank you.

00:42:34.365 --> 00:42:35.240
Please come in.

00:42:46.001 --> 00:42:48.420
You didn't rent the studio
to have me over, right?

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:52.508
I use subscription services a lot
to manage daily essentials.

00:42:53.175 --> 00:42:55.511
So, do you see me a little?

00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:58.013
What do you mean?

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:00.057
In a column Mr. Baek wrote,

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.976
a home can show
someone's personality, habits,

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.228
job, daily routines,

00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:07.106
whether they're married
and what their partner likes.

00:43:10.734 --> 00:43:13.237
My girlfriend got me
the five-ply embossed one.

00:43:14.071 --> 00:43:16.073
Does that make me a more layered person?

00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:20.369
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:43:24.998 --> 00:43:26.834
Do you normally eat like this?

00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:28.502
It's like a birthday feast.

00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.963
It is, actually.

00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:33.090
Sorry?

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:35.384
This is from my birth mother.

00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:38.345
My sister gave me this.

00:43:39.513 --> 00:43:40.639
Help yourself.

00:43:40.723 --> 00:43:43.767
And my mother's good
at making this gosari dish.

00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:50.566
You should've told me
that it was your birthday.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.695
If I had known,
I wouldn't have brought that toilet paper.

00:43:54.778 --> 00:43:57.030
Then all those gifts piled up
by the door--

00:43:57.114 --> 00:44:01.034
No. Those are all bribes
I'd rather not bring inside.

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:04.872
They're for Attorney Seo,
not Seo Su-hyeok.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.418
The only gift for me
is that premium toilet paper.

00:44:11.837 --> 00:44:13.380
Let's meet tomorrow again.

00:44:13.464 --> 00:44:16.216
Tomorrow, I'll give you a proper gift.

00:44:17.676 --> 00:44:19.303
Not sure if you heard…

00:44:20.554 --> 00:44:21.930
but I'm no longer Attorney Seo.

00:44:24.057 --> 00:44:27.770
Mr. Baek came by
the day after he kidnapped you

00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:28.896
to get me off the case.

00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:32.232
He said he wanted to go
one-on-one with you.

00:44:35.903 --> 00:44:39.323
Now it's just the two of us,
without the lawsuit,

00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:41.575
how does that feel?

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.681
Su-bak.

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.769
Hey, where did you get that?

00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:12.981
Hey, hold on. Hey.

00:45:20.906 --> 00:45:22.449
I got B minus.

00:45:24.034 --> 00:45:25.077
Are my grades toast?

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.038
I told you to start over, didn't I?

00:45:28.121 --> 00:45:29.331
How dare you?

00:45:32.876 --> 00:45:34.086
Hey.

00:45:34.169 --> 00:45:35.837
That was my first laugh of the day.

00:45:35.921 --> 00:45:38.882
You made Song Ha-gyeong glove.

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:44.471
Let someone hold your hand if you're cold,
instead of wearing some odd glove.

00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:46.890
What? My hands aren't cold at all.

00:45:48.225 --> 00:45:49.393
It's actually really warm.

00:45:59.528 --> 00:46:00.737
So…

00:46:01.697 --> 00:46:02.990
have you remembered anything?

00:46:04.533 --> 00:46:05.617
Nope.

00:46:06.285 --> 00:46:07.452
If you don't remember,

00:46:08.662 --> 00:46:12.165
why not just ask Mr. Baek
what happened?

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:14.459
I don't want to.

00:46:15.627 --> 00:46:20.090
Is it like the time you didn't ask
whether he'd read the final arguments?

00:46:24.928 --> 00:46:25.887
Attorney Seo.

00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:28.515
Let me tell you a little bit
about my life.

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:32.311
It's more twisted than this.

00:46:32.853 --> 00:46:37.649
So I'm not sure where to start
and how to sort it out.

00:46:41.236 --> 00:46:45.115
Then what was the first thing you twisted?

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.455
Not sure what that is.

00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:54.541
But I know what got most twisted.

00:46:57.461 --> 00:46:59.338
My very first confession ever…

00:47:00.297 --> 00:47:01.798
didn't go to the person I liked…

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.010
but to someone who liked me.

00:47:08.305 --> 00:47:09.389
Dāl bhāt.

00:47:10.223 --> 00:47:11.183
You mean him?

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.394
Yes.

00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:22.361
Attorney Seo.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:27.366
I have a trick I've relied on
whenever things got twisted.

00:47:27.866 --> 00:47:28.867
Wanna know what it is?

00:47:31.203 --> 00:47:32.996
Freezing it in the fridge.

00:47:35.248 --> 00:47:36.083
This is how.

00:47:37.668 --> 00:47:39.878
When my hands are cold,
I freeze everything nearby.

00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:43.674
That way,
I don't even notice my hands are cold.

00:47:45.467 --> 00:47:47.010
And somehow I barely…

00:47:47.886 --> 00:47:49.554
-Barely…
-You're barely…

00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:52.891
holding on, completely blacked out?

00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:05.654
I invited you today
because I was feeling childish.

00:48:06.947 --> 00:48:08.281
You went to the west coast.

00:48:09.241 --> 00:48:11.451
I fought my urge
to take you to the east coast.

00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:14.830
I came up with somewhere stronger.

00:48:18.125 --> 00:48:20.252
So I bought a wine, which I never do…

00:48:21.753 --> 00:48:24.172
fixed the light that'd been out for days,

00:48:24.715 --> 00:48:26.842
and said I'd go on a business trip.

00:48:28.051 --> 00:48:30.387
It's along the same lines
as playing tennis.

00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:35.517
I've been wondering if it's okay
to get involved with you two,

00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:39.146
and I wanted to really think it through.

00:48:50.407 --> 00:48:53.243
Are you insane?
Why do you keep grinning?

00:48:53.326 --> 00:48:58.123
Before moving abroad, have you
tried knitting for a school project?

00:48:59.249 --> 00:49:00.959
You know what Ha-gyeong did?

00:49:02.127 --> 00:49:05.338
She knitted a glove with six fingers.

00:49:06.089 --> 00:49:07.007
Isn't that funny?

00:49:08.592 --> 00:49:11.136
Are you crazy?
Are you all right?

00:49:11.636 --> 00:49:12.471
I mean,

00:49:13.513 --> 00:49:16.308
Ha-gyeong's box is packed
with things like that.

00:49:21.646 --> 00:49:22.981
That's how she is,

00:49:23.774 --> 00:49:26.276
but I kept trying to fix what's twisted…

00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.987
which is crazy.

00:49:30.822 --> 00:49:31.990
So…

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.284
what I'm saying is,

00:49:35.035 --> 00:49:36.495
I'm really sorry, Yoon So-hee…

00:49:39.206 --> 00:49:41.833
but give up on me and go back now.

00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:44.336
You're the only one I can trust.

00:49:45.962 --> 00:49:47.297
Go handle the project.

00:49:47.923 --> 00:49:49.049
Don't waste your time.

00:50:00.435 --> 00:50:02.229
When will you talk about Do-young?

00:50:05.315 --> 00:50:06.441
What about him?

00:50:08.026 --> 00:50:09.736
What he wrote in the email.

00:50:13.365 --> 00:50:16.827
You want to see me play the villain?
Care to see my last desperate move?

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:19.996
-That's not who you are.
-You know nothing.

00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:23.083
Should I show you
how much of a villain I am?

00:50:23.708 --> 00:50:25.627
-Hey.
-I'll call Song Ha-gyeong.

00:50:28.129 --> 00:50:30.257
You know she keeps checking
my social media?

00:50:30.966 --> 00:50:33.468
She's liked and unliked my posts
so many times.

00:50:35.554 --> 00:50:38.390
What? Why?

00:50:39.224 --> 00:50:41.560
Do you have to ask?
To see you, obviously.

00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:44.187
To see how you're doing,
pictures of you.

00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:45.897
She knew about me all along.

00:50:48.358 --> 00:50:49.526
You like someone like her?

00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:51.820
Yes.

00:50:53.864 --> 00:50:56.783
-She's transparent.
-No, she's not. She's devious.

00:50:57.576 --> 00:51:00.662
No. She's transparent.

00:51:06.293 --> 00:51:07.794
You're insane.

00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:10.088
You're nuts. Get lost.

00:51:12.007 --> 00:51:13.592
-Happy?
-The moon is out.

00:51:18.096 --> 00:51:19.347
So cute.

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:22.183
I love it.

00:51:30.358 --> 00:51:31.484
Just get lost.

00:51:36.323 --> 00:51:38.116
I can't get into my own house.

00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:47.167
So, Ms. Song.
Find that lost memory.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.338
If you track down that memory,
you'll see your feelings.

00:51:52.464 --> 00:51:54.799
There, you'll find the answer about us.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:56.551
When I come back…

00:51:57.636 --> 00:51:58.845
let's talk about it.

00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:07.270
Following the broken film of my memories,

00:52:08.647 --> 00:52:09.981
I only confirmed them.

00:52:12.192 --> 00:52:13.652
That racing heart.

00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:17.489
The feelings I'd felt every summer.

00:52:19.366 --> 00:52:23.411
The feelings I shut away
because of guilt.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.959
It won't work, right?

00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:32.253
I don't think so.

00:52:32.337 --> 00:52:33.296
-Right?
-Yes.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.975
You said a week would do.

00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:47.143
What?

00:52:47.227 --> 00:52:48.937
One week is enough.

00:52:50.146 --> 00:52:51.648
The recording's going well, right?

00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:55.318
You promised that you'd find a way
to secure that budget.

00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:58.947
I'll even reallocate the budget
to get all the money.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.407
Oh, no.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:02.534
That's why we decided
not to go with marble

00:53:02.617 --> 00:53:03.743
and use tiles throughout.

00:53:05.954 --> 00:53:06.871
This.

00:53:08.289 --> 00:53:09.165
This.

00:53:18.425 --> 00:53:19.801
One week is enough.

00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:23.430
The recording's going well, right?

00:53:25.932 --> 00:53:29.144
Do you know who I am?
I'm Dr. Song of Patan.

00:53:30.353 --> 00:53:31.187
You know what?

00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:33.982
I'll step up and support you.

00:53:34.899 --> 00:53:38.028
I'll even reallocate the budget
to get all the money.

00:53:39.195 --> 00:53:40.905
Director Baek.

00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:42.323
I'll act as the liaison

00:53:42.407 --> 00:53:45.869
with the residents
to make things easier for you.

00:53:46.661 --> 00:53:48.246
So please,

00:53:49.456 --> 00:53:53.710
don't go overboard, trying to use
only premium materials throughout.

00:53:57.797 --> 00:53:58.798
Promise.

00:54:06.389 --> 00:54:07.390
Copy.

00:54:08.183 --> 00:54:09.309
Come on, signature.

00:54:14.064 --> 00:54:14.898
Okay.

00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:18.026
Darn it.

00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:19.152
What do I do?

00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:20.945
What have I been doing for a week?

00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:26.117
Sir, I'll count on you.

00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:27.786
-Sure, bye.
-Bye.

00:54:37.045 --> 00:54:38.713
Director Baek?

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.674
Ms. Song.

00:54:41.758 --> 00:54:42.967
Yes?

00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:44.928
This is the equipment materials
change form.

00:54:45.553 --> 00:54:46.763
You didn't get it approved?

00:54:46.846 --> 00:54:49.099
It's due today, so I came to get it.

00:54:49.182 --> 00:54:50.558
But he already left.

00:54:50.642 --> 00:54:53.103
Without this,
we can't install the electricity tomorrow.

00:54:54.562 --> 00:54:55.980
Oh, no. This is bad.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.901
What do we do?

00:55:12.664 --> 00:55:13.498
Ms. Song.

00:55:14.374 --> 00:55:15.834
Hi.

00:55:18.461 --> 00:55:19.587
Wait, Hyun.

00:55:21.172 --> 00:55:23.842
The director is in a meeting,
but it's almost over.

00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:25.343
You can see him in a bit.

00:55:25.426 --> 00:55:27.387
No, I'm a little busy now.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:29.389
Could you pass this along for me?

00:55:29.472 --> 00:55:31.057
-Sure.
-Thank you.

00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:32.767
Song.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.394
Seung-taek.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.150
What's going on?
Is Do-ha building your newlywed home?

00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:43.736
Seul and I visited the wedding hall.

00:55:45.446 --> 00:55:46.656
Oh.

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:48.366
Are you two keeping that a secret?

00:55:50.285 --> 00:55:53.371
I was thinking
how long you'd just keep dating.

00:55:53.454 --> 00:55:54.706
What about you?

00:55:55.415 --> 00:55:57.000
How long will this go on with Do-ha?

00:55:58.626 --> 00:56:00.086
That's an unexpected question.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:04.174
Song Ha-gyeong.
Let me stick my nose in just this once.

00:56:04.257 --> 00:56:05.550
Listen, this may be the last.

00:56:12.182 --> 00:56:16.519
If you keep pushing him away,
you think he'll keep chasing you?

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:21.524
He's only like that with you.
He only opens up to you.

00:56:22.901 --> 00:56:24.527
Don't let those moments

00:56:25.695 --> 00:56:26.779
just slip by.

00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:40.752
Hi, Attorney Seo.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.255
Did you arrive safely?

00:56:45.673 --> 00:56:47.675
I'm free now. I'm actually in Seoul.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.263
Sure, I'll be right there. See you soon.

00:57:00.188 --> 00:57:01.356
Hello?

00:57:10.114 --> 00:57:11.074
Where's Director Baek?

00:57:12.158 --> 00:57:13.868
Did he get hurt a lot? How bad?

00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:17.622
We did some first aid,
but the bleeding didn't stop.

00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:19.582
-So he went home.
-I see.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.514
Baek Do-ha!

00:57:46.192 --> 00:57:47.610
Where did he go?

00:57:52.365 --> 00:57:53.449
Where are you?

00:57:53.533 --> 00:57:54.951
Me? I'm home.

00:57:55.868 --> 00:57:57.620
Home? Where exactly?

00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:08.798
What's wrong?

00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:12.552
I heard you got hurt. Is it bad?

00:58:16.723 --> 00:58:17.557
You mean this?

00:58:21.686 --> 00:58:24.439
I can't believe Ms. Song
came running here.

00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:28.276
I called to ask for more time.

00:58:34.073 --> 00:58:35.074
Hey!

00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:39.871
You heard I got hurt and came running?

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.687
This is why I like you.

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:39.389
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

00:59:43.893 --> 00:59:46.521
Why do you keep hovering around me?

00:59:48.272 --> 00:59:49.273
So, you don't like it?

00:59:56.864 --> 00:59:58.658
Even so…

01:00:00.284 --> 01:00:02.412
you understand Song Ha-gyeong language.

01:00:05.748 --> 01:00:06.916
I hate you.

01:00:09.168 --> 01:00:10.086
You know that, right?

01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:14.674
So just go.

01:00:17.385 --> 01:00:18.219
Okay?

01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:23.850
Are you really leaving?

01:00:25.601 --> 01:00:26.436
No.

01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:29.397
I won't go.

01:00:34.986 --> 01:00:35.820
Don't go.

01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:42.660
Don't go.

01:00:48.833 --> 01:00:49.667
I won't.

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:33.711
Looks like we won't be sleeping tonight.

01:01:33.795 --> 01:01:35.171
-Hey.
-Can't do that.

01:01:35.254 --> 01:01:36.631
Stop it.

01:01:36.714 --> 01:01:39.217
I still hate him, but I like him.

01:01:39.884 --> 01:01:41.302
Baek Do-ha, I like you.

01:01:41.385 --> 01:01:43.471
I'm going to hold your hand.

01:01:43.554 --> 01:01:46.098
Have you eaten?
If it's okay, why don't we--

01:01:46.182 --> 01:01:47.600
-I'm at the east coast.
-What?

01:01:47.683 --> 01:01:49.852
We somehow made it to the east coast.

01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:52.480
-Go with this.
-Stop the construction.

01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:54.148
What is this all of a sudden?

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.608
It wasn't me who said stop.

01:01:55.691 --> 01:01:56.692
What's wrong?

01:01:56.776 --> 01:01:58.986
Maybe if we stay close,

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:01.364
we'll end up seeing things
we didn't want to see.

01:02:02.323 --> 01:02:06.536
How many more
of the summer secrets are still left?

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:09.247
I need to go to the States for a bit.
