[Episode 14]

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.260
Serve my father his tea.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.620
Hurry up.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.980
I know you want revenge,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.580
but before you get your revenge,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.620
you must first learn to endure hardship.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.980
Understand, kid?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.420
I don't need your fake concern.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.580
You're wrong.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.300
It's not fake concern.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.820
I want you to live

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.860
to watch me

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.980
take away everything you care about,
piece by piece.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.220
Last night,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.780
while you were with Mr. Li,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.820
Wenbin

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.860
was in my room.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.500
Military Governor Chen has written
to break off the engagement.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.980
Impossible!

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.140
My Dad will definitely fight for me!

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.260
Does he care about you?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.980
He cares about power.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.900
Would he offend the Chen family

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.620
for you?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.100
Tell me,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.980
would he find another woman

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.740
to replace you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.820
to marry Chen Wenbin?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.060
He never loved you.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.740
He never saw you as a daughter.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.540
You're just a lap dog
he can order around.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.420
What Mr. Li did to you...

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.220
if he cared about you,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.140
even a little bit,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.220
my words would never have worked.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.140
All your misery
is thanks to Wang Penghui.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.420
I'll kill you!

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.860
My friend,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.020
didn't I teach you

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.940
that a clever woman

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.420
only deals with the man?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.100
If I were you,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.540
I'd replace

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.220
Wang Penghui.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.140
The Wang family

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.820
can have only one master.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.740
Everyone is against me!

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.940
The engagement is broken,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.620
and the Chamber of Commerce
won't let me in!

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.620
Who do they think they are?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.860
What have you found out about Mr. Li?

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.860
Who exactly did it?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.100
Um... Sir, for secrecy,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.740
you didn't allow anyone on that floor.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.280
Darn it.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.180
Chen Wenbin.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.300
It must have been him.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.540
I'll settle this score with him
sooner or later.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.740
What will he do to Wenbin?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.620
I need to speed things up.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.420
Sir,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.420
Miss Wang seemed very upset earlier.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.740
She even smashed your photograph.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.980
She's upset, huh?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.060
You may go.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.140
Yes.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.380
About last night,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.300
there might have been
some misunderstanding.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.540
I owe you an apology.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.220
So, to make it up to you,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.300
how about we...

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.540
Move the wedding date forward?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.020
You can take your time
making it up to me.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.500
Wang Wan'er,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.820
what's going on here?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.140
Where's Liu Rumeng?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.500
Did no one tell you?

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.940
My Dad's wedding has been moved up.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.380
Liu Rumeng

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.860
went back to The Paramount
to prepare for the wedding.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.460
My Dad has also gone to fetch his bride.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.260
No one cares about me at all.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.020
Wenbin,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.140
you're my fiancé.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.820
Why is it

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.220
that everyone only has eyes for her?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.620
The engagement is off.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.260
Liu Rumeng...

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.100
Meng,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.980
you must be careful this time.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.180
Mr. Li is protecting his own interests.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.620
Military Governor Chen has broken off
the engagement with the Wang family.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.500
The Chamber of Commerce,
the military government,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.300
I've severed all the support

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.420
around Wang Penghui.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.220
Wang Wan'er has turned against him.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.580
We're only one step away.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.780
But you and...

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.420
Meng, are you really sure about this?

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.700
Wenbin and I

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.380
aren't children anymore.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.620
We've planned for so long.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.260
We must bring this to an end.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.420
Your first love
is getting married today.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.380
Well, seeing her off with your eyes?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.580
I can't let her marry Wang Penghui.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.500
Are you going to crash the wedding?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.380
That's intense.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.260
Another car's coming.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:47.820
Come with us!

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.420
Who are you?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.780
Now!

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.780
What are you doing?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.540
You ordered this?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.940
After them!

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.140
Why is there only one person?

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.300
Where's the old man?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020
I don't know either.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.220
There was only one person in the car.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.380
What do we do now?

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.340
Forget it.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.500
One is better than none.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.380
We can still get half the pay
if we take her out.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.780
Chick, we're just hired hands.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.660
Don't blame us. You crossed Miss Wang.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.420
Miss Wang said

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.420
a trashy woman like you

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.220
could never marry into the Wang family.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.460
Stop!

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.820
Get out!

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.100
Rumeng!

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.580
Rumeng!

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.100
Rumeng! Rumeng!

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.180
Wake up!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.060
Rumeng!

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.620
Rumeng!

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.380
Wang Wan'er tried to kill me.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.900
I'm going to the wedding banquet.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.180
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.860
Are you really going to the wedding?

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.140
I'm going to the wedding.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.420
Let me go! I'm going to the wedding!

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.100
Have you forgotten everything?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.460
This is the Tiger-Head Lock
I gave you at the orphanage.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.220
And the candy I stole for you
back then...

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.540
Can't you find it in yourself
to trust me, just this once?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.500
I'm sorry.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.980
I was wrong.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.260
I shouldn't have
left the orphanage alone.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.580
I broke our promise first.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.780
But you've already died once.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.300
I can't...

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.260
I can't stand by

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.780
and watch you
throw yourself to the wolves.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.300
I can't bear to lose you again.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.620
No matter what comes our way,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.180
I'll be right there with you.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.740
I'm sorry.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.020
This is where it ends.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.420
I'm very grateful you came into my life.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.820
That time

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.580
was one of the few

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.100
warm and happy periods of my life.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.780
I can't let go of my hatred.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.660
Forget me,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.380
Su Jinmo.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.900
You remember me? You still remember me?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.300
Step aside.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.340
Or I will shoot myself.
