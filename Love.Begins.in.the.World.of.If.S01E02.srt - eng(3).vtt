WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.550
Sales Tech.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.720
Neither sales nor tech.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.260
That perfectly describes someone
like me, stuck in the middle.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.030
- Iwase, Sawada Electric is on the line...
- I'll take it.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.920
You used to be in the tech department.
So you get that stuff, no problem.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.520
But regular clients don't
understand any of it.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.440
You're in sales now.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.460
Not in the tech department.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.259
It's because you guys ignore
all the technical limitations...

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.339
and keep taking on
these impossible projects...

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.589
that I was transferred
here in the first place!

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.926
That's the first I'm hearing of it!

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.310
I have nothing more to say to you.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.110
Don't try to carry everything on your own.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.090
It's chocolate.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.300
If I could...

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.410
I want to earn Ogami's approval...

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.420
and be able to smile
back at him naturally...

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.300
That's the kind of person I want to be.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.910
Kano.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.330
Kano.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.850
- Ogami...?
- Are you okay?!

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.150
Sorry for making you worry.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.060
Ah...

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.500
Kano.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.560
Don't make me worry like that again.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
Huh?!

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.020
What are you doing?!

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.230
I'm taking you home.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.620
I can't let anything happen to you.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.550
What are you doing? Put me down!

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.520
Hey, this is dangerous.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.750
- You might have hit your head.
- No! I'm really fine. I can get home by myself.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.760
Are you sure?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.280
- Should I call you a cab?
- No, that's okay.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
I'll go by myself!

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.790
What was all that about...?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.550
I get it now.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.420
Ogami must have been drunk.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.900
Seriously, what a weird drunk...

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.390
Huh...?

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.910
Huh...?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.700
(Introduction to Golf)

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.220
Did I buy this book?

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.770
Morning.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
Morning.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.370
Oh, morning.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
Morning.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.370
Huh?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.040
The files for the alternative
plan I made yesterday are gone?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.530
Hello.

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.040
This is SEEDS SYSTEM.
Kano from the Sales Department speaking.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880
Yes.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
Yes.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.360
One moment, please.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.690
Iwase, Sawada Electric is on the line.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.150
Oh, thanks.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.570
Put them through.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.710
What's wrong? Spacing out?

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.510
Oh... sorry.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.890
Kano.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.840
Oh...!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.930
Did you get home all right last night?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.600
Uh... yeah...

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.510
That's a relief.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.250
I was worried about you.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.110
You're not still drunk, are you...?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.810
Huh?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.080
Kano-san, Ogami-san, good morning!

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.640
Ah, Kano-san, this.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.670
Could you please check this?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.940
Huh?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.440
Could you please check this?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.410
Oh, okay...

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.120
That Ginza restaurant we talked about.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.959
Oh, that place.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.050
- It was a great spot, right?
- It was amazing.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.820
I was so moved.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.090
Especially the final course.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.210
The pudding.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.070
That was absolutely delicious.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.690
This part right here...

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.570
Huh, what is it now?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.800
Um...

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.060
I really don't understand
what Kano-san says.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.980
He uses so much jargon,
I can't keep up at all.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.510
No, it's okay.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.230
I'll take it from here.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.170
The standard features and
add-on modules are mixed up here.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.760
Huh, really?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.650
Oh, it's fine. I'll fix it later.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.270
No, this is Tomioka's
responsibility, isn't it?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.440
Kano, you should give him some
advice from your area of expertise.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.630
Yeah.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Please teach me, just like you always do.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.010
Like I always do...?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.260
I...

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.970
I know I make a lot of small mistakes...

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.920
but I'll do my best to learn.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.900
That's the spirit, Tomioka.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.239
With such a reliable Sales Tech here,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.470
Exactly!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.850
I really depend on Kano-san.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.990
But Tomioka, it's time you
stepped out from under Kano's wing.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.269
Kano is nice and will always answer you,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.596
but it's about time you learned
to stand on your own two feet.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.910
Okay~ I'll try to do it
myself starting next week...

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.410
- Next week?
- Yep.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.580
What in the world is going on?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.300
Everyone's acting like
completely different people.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.350
Could it be...

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.010
some kind of prank show?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640
Are there cameras?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.870
No.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.630
Maybe it's because I'm such a loner...

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.070
that the company
held an internal meeting...

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.930
and decided to improve
how everyone treats me...?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.170
That has to be it.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.630
HR probably sent out a memo.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.040
My inability to fit in was
flagged as a problem.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.780
That's why everyone's
suddenly being so nice.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.240
Otherwise, it's just too weird.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.710
Just how much trouble
have I caused everyone...?

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.850
Oh no.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380
Ah.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.150
Your hands are so cold.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.170
Let's go.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700
Huh?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.700
"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 2)

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.740
Here, hot cocoa.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.010
What are you worried about now?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.400
Tell me what's wrong.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.990
Why?

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.026
Is it something you can't tell me?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.750
- Then who do you think...
- That's not it.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.960
How do you know about my condition?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.560
How could I not know?

00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.161
You're the one who told me, weren't you?

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.910
I did?

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.730
You said that when you get extremely
nervous, your body temperature drops.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.030
And that something
sweet helps you feel better.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.059
Also, you get dizzy
spells, like you're anemic.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.780
And you suddenly get very sleepy, right?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.100
Isn't that right?

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.040
Well, yeah.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.060
But when did I ever say any of that...?

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.050
Besides you,

00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:09.280
who else would talk about
your physical condition?

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.710
I guess that's true.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.470
Hey, are you all right?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
Don't tell me...

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.620
Did Ibushi-san contact you again?

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.290
You have the hardest time
dealing with people like Ibushi-san.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.740
By the way.

00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:28.830
The files for the alternative plan
I prepared yesterday are missing.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.520
Alternative plan?

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.320
Didn't I tell you yesterday...

00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:34.801
that I was going to Ibushi-san's
this weekend to apologize?

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.810
Apologize?

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.140
Isn't it just our regular
meeting this weekend?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800
Huh?

00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:45.940
(Route Print Meeting with Ibushi)

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:46.964
A meeting?

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:48.410
Huh, but...

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.360
I'm sure I called him personally
yesterday to set up the apology.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.140
Huh...

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.300
I'm sure I even sent
Ibushi-san a confirmation email.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.520
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.299
Besides, if it's Ibushi-san's project,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.300
you wouldn't do anything
without running it by me.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.440
Why would I need to run it by you?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
Why, you ask?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.330
It's a project we're both in charge of.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.260
We've been going to the
meetings together since the start.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.100
A suit I've never worn...

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.850
And liquor I never bought...?

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.460
And photos that were never taken...

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.040
And...

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.670
Enough. I have nothing more to say to you.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.840
A conflict that never even happened...

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400
What...

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.130
is going on?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.530
I remember then...

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.870
when I came to this shrine...

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.780
I looked into this mirror...

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.530
After that, Ogami was clearly not himself.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.750
Of course, nothing's changed.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.020
Are you interested in that mirror?

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.160
No...

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.530
This place...

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.640
enshrines a mirror that was salvaged
from the bottom of a lake long ago.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.999
That mirror...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.290
was once offered to
the lord who ruled this land.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.360
That lord...

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.190
was someone who was
afraid of even a mouse.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.280
A coward.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.766
But it's said that whenever
he looked into that mirror,

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.990
for some reason...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.719
what was reflected in it...

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.060
was the image of him
bravely fighting off a tiger.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.970
In the mirror...?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.580
One day, a bear broke into the castle.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.300
The once-timid lord...

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.590
began to act just like his reflection.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.850
And he actually managed
to fight off the bear.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.560
Ever since then, this mirror...

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.320
has been known as the mirror that reflects
'an ideal self, different from reality.'

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.030
They say that whoever you wish to become
will appear in it.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.970
Who I wish to become...

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.910
If I could...

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.960
I wish I could fit in with the sales
team and get along with everyone...

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.130
get Ogami's approval,

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.340
and be able to smile
back at him naturally...

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.510
That's the kind of person I want to be.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.610
Um...

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.490
This might sound like a strange question,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960
but...

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.150
the lord from the legend...

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.520
is it possible... he went into the mirror?
Into that 'world where the ideal self resides'?

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.690
Is there a legend like that...?

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.770
Huh?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.920
Oh, it was just a hypothetical.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.510
Oh, right.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.980
Some people do say that from time to time.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.990
Really?

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.850
They say things like they went
to the ideal world inside the mirror.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.540
I have heard people say that, yes.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.460
But...

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.150
I've been working here for a long time,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.490
and I've never once managed
to get inside the mirror.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.660
Ah.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.430
But maybe...

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.710
a miracle like that could really happen.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.350
It's like going to a parallel world,

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.530
or something.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.890
A parallel world.

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:51.546
(Parallel World)

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.260
A parallel world is defined...

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.910
as another world that
branches off from a certain world

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.090
and exists in parallel with it.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.920
Speaking of which, everyone...

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.990
- It's the person in charge from Sawada Electric on the line...
- I'll take it.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.560
Oh, thanks.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.870
Put them through.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.550
I...

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.270
I know I make a lot of small mistakes,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.870
but I'll work hard to learn.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.820
You're in sales now.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.110
Not in the techincal department.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.960
Stop making everyone worry so much.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.360
Everyone's acting like a
completely different person...

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.300
Could it be that this world...

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.870
is actually a parallel world?

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.030
Hey, Kano!

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.500
Let's go for a drink tonight.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.770
Huh...?

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.080
I found an awesome place.
Not like that last joint that bombed.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.390
Hey.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.100
Don't say it bombed.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.260
- It just had a... unique flavor, that's all.
- That's what you call a bomb.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.560
Right, Kano?

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.480
Uh...

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.230
Kano was the only one who
kept saying how good it was.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.110
You're way too nice, man.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.020
Oh, Ogami.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.590
You're coming too, right?

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.019
Sure, if Uchida's buying.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.480
Why me?

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.700
Thanks, Uchida-san!

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.370
I'll be sure to study the fine
art of the company dinner.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.560
Get to studying!

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.740
Right, Kano?

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.430
Yeah.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.170
Please teach me your ways...

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.660
Kano, don't you go along with them.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.600
- I'm heading out to a client.
- Okay.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.650
And that's a wrap for
tonight's drinking party!

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.220
Uchida-san,

00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:29.516
- Thanks so much for treating us tonight.
- I learned a lot.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.000
You guys really don't hold back, do you?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.970
Sorry... I can pay for my share.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.350
It's fine, it's fine.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.520
You're still the same. Too
honest for your own good.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.290
Uchida-san, let's go for round two!

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.279
Ugh, you guys are impossible.
What about you two?

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.280
I'm in.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.150
- Sorry, I think I'll head home...
- Me too...

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.730
Thanks for everything tonight.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.180
Aww...

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.010
Oh, let's take a picture
before we go. A picture!

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.280
A picture!

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.610
Okay, picture time. Here we go.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.330
Okay, smile!

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.380
Okay.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.729
- I'll send this to everyone later.
- Thanks!

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.730
Let's go!

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.210
See ya.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.230
- Thanks for treating us tonight.
- See you tomorrow.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.450
Let's go.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.819
- There's a good place over there.
- Really?

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.520
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.510
Well then...

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.460
You've been pretty quiet today.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.290
Huh...?

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.650
You're not bored, are you?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.740
Not at all.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.630
I... had a great time.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280
What's with you?

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.620
It's nothing.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.300
I'm glad you had fun.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.760
Anyway, I'm counting on
you for the meeting tomorrow.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.040
To... Tomorrow? Do I have to go too?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.046
Is there some other
meeting I don't know about?

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.270
No... that's not what I meant.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.259
I just mean... you can
handle it on your own, Ogami.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.510
You don't need me there.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.800
What are you talking about?

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.280
I need you.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.460
I'm counting on you,

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.930
partner.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.340
See you.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Partner...

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.500
I'm so glad you were there.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.590
I definitely couldn't have answered
that last question on my own.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.420
That client knew way more than I expected.
Even I was surprised.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.340
I heard he used to be in a technical field.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.800
He mentioned it last time
we had dinner together.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.590
Is that why you asked me to come along?

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.800
Exactly.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.060
By the way.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.970
Can you come with me to one more place?

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.420
Another meeting?

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.750
I didn't prepare anything.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.990
No.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160
It's not for work.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.370
Not for work?

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.710
There's just somewhere I
wanted you to go with me.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.930
Where are we...?

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.810
I've always wanted to check this place out.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.730
You wanted to come here?

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:54.890
But, you know.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.836
It's pretty embarrassing to
come to a place like this alone.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.060
No way, two guys coming
here is even more embarrassing.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.090
Fair point.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.329
It's close to where we had our meeting,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.120
so I figured today was my only chance.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.750
So...

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.280
what's the occasion?

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.230
For this, of course...

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.120
Sorry for the wait. Here
are your berry macarons.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.690
Please enjoy your dessert time.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780
This...?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.070
The truth is,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.420
I've been dying to try this.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.150
Ogami... you?

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.490
Are you that surprised?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.350
No, it's just...

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.100
It's just that, with your face...

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.160
So you think I'm not the macaron type?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.950
I didn't say that, but...

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.780
It's written all over your face.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.019
- Stop trying to read my face.
- Just shut up and eat.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.350
Come on, try it.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.570
You're always eating sweets, aren't you?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.470
No, I'm not.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.890
Like I said, that's...

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.540
I only eat them when I have to...

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.200
I could eat two more of these.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.460
- Two might be pushing it.
- Seriously.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.890
You try one.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.580
Maybe three...

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.860
Three would definitely be pushing it.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.010
No.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.460
This...

00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:00.350
It's worth enduring the
embarrassment for this.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.600
Yeah.

00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.740
Ogami, how did you know about this place?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.070
Mitsuno-san from sales admin told me about
it.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.040
She's a total foodie.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.380
Oh.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.620
So does that mean you've
been to a lot of dessert shops?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.160
Quite a few, actually.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.550
I'm surprised.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.520
But I'm really glad I could
come here with you today, Kano.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.110
Huh?

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.540
Because when something's this good, you
want to share it with someone right away.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.180
Oh...

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.340
And it's also a way to say thank you.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780
Thank you?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.000
For all your help.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.780
Thanks.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.130
Kano.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720
Yeah.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.730
I never thought I'd be able to
laugh and talk with Ogami like that.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.760
I still can't quite believe it.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.099
The Ogami from my original world...

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.240
This would be impossible.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.760
But in this world...

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.230
I'm counting on you,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.550
partner.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.760
Partner, huh...

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.470
This is incredible...

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.550
The circumstances are the same,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.000
but it's a world of difference.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.180
In this world,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.720
it feels like everything will work out.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.360
Oh, Kano.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.420
Keiyo Chemical is considering
bringing in our new system.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.756
Can you head over and give
them a presentation next weekend?

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.590
Oh, okay. Um...

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.326
That's in Aichi Prefecture, right?

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.740
That's right. Ogami will go with you.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.130
I'm counting on you.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.900
Got it.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.750
This is our first business trip together.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.319
Let's nail this contract,

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.720
and then grab a great meal to
celebrate before we head back.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420
The two of us...

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.590
on a business trip.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.429
(Next Episode)
I just hope Ogami sees one good thing about me.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.159
(Will their relationship deepen?) You must be
doing well in sales because of all your hard work.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.216
([The If Parallel World] Akihito's feelings
are changing too) You're incredible.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.419
I've been trying so
hard not to think about it.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.280
Can I... really stay here?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.480
I...

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720
The truth is...
