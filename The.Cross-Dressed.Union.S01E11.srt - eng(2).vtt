Young Master Lin

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.200
Young Master Lin

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.680
Come.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.840
Slow down.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.960
Come.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.480
How is it?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.160
Come.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.320
Young Master Lin

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.480
Young Master Lin, Young Master Lin.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.720
Ling An Hanlin Grand Scholar Rui Yu

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.920
By order of Our Majesty

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.240
I am visiting Pingxiang

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.840
to pay respects to the Prince of Pingxiang.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.080
It's been a long time.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.920
Lord Rui, you are as distinguished as ever.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040
Foreign envoys must be received by officials.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.200
A memorial has been submitted.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.720
I will determine the purpose of your visit.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.400
Then arrange a meeting accordingly.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.200
His Highness summoned you to the hall

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.640
to discuss state affairs.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800
Why summon a foreign envoy at this time?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.960
Could it be

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.400
Lord Rui wishes to defect to Pingxiang?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.000
If not,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
why not bow before the Prince?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.760
When an envoy visits,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.000
the one to meet

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.960
is naturally your country's ruler.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.320
I've already submitted a memorial to the palace.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.480
But Your Highness keeps obstructing me.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.760
Are you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.960
trying to exceed your authority?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.760
Regent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.600
Aren't you looking to change the grain trade

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.640
ratio between Pingxiang and Ling Qian?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.240
Lord Rui is right here now.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520
You can discuss it with him.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.400
No need to send envoys all the way to Ling An.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.200
Lord Rui, you're too late.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080
I've already settled it with Qian Yuan.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.800
We'll buy twenty percent of our grain from Qian Yuan.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.000
This matter

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.080
has nothing to discuss with Ling An.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.040
I don't wish to discuss it

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.520
with Your Highness either.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.720
Since I arrived in Pingxiang,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.680
I've noticed

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.520
Pingxiang is rich in fruit,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.960
with many varieties.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.720
Plus, Pingxiang is famed for Huanghuali.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.720
With such abundant resources,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.480
it should be even more prosperous.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.720
But why

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.080
when there's no curfew,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.080
are the streets

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480
still so empty?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.760
It's far less lively than Ling An.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.840
Lord Rui, what do you mean by this?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.960
Are you mocking Pingxiang's poverty?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.760
I mean no offense.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.240
But your words

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.560
point out the real issue.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.800
Pingxiang has little farmland.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.160
Its grain output

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240
can't feed all its people.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.560
It must import grain every year.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.840
This drains the national treasury.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.680
As a result,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.440
developing other industries

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.840
and enriching people's lives

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.480
becomes even harder.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.680
It's a tough challenge.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.920
Lord Rui has only stayed here a few days.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.800
How do you know

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.080
about our empty treasury?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.760
Such confidential matters?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.240
May I ask, sir,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.440
what is your position?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.840
I am the Vice Minister of Revenue.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.520
You know better than I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.920
if the treasury is empty.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.720
I won't teach a fish how to swim.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.920
I just want to say one thing.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.800
I'm here to bring Pingxiang

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.280
silver.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.760
Why is Lord Rui so generous?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.920
Giving us money for nothing?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.720
Sending silver to Pingxiang?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.040
Is it to use mutual trade to control us?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.800
Now that the Prince has ascended,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.240
he expands farming and cares for the people.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.800
Soon, we won't need your help.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.720
Lord Rui speaks only of money.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.160
Isn't that beneath a scholar's integrity?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.840
Today, I am here

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.480
not to discuss

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.520
poetry or prose.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.520
Whether a scholar's integrity

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.480
conflicts with wealth,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.240
let's set that aside.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040
Today,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.800
I wish to speak with the Prince of Pingxiang

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.520
about terms.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.640
What terms do you wish to discuss?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.920
Renew the alliance treaty,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.040
build a trade route,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.320
and open mutual trade.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.680
After that,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.160
Ling An will annually

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.680
buy at thirty percent of Pingxiang's price

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.320
fruit and Huanghuali.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.520
This way,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.040
Pingxiang's surplus is solved,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.320
and Pingxiang gains silver

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.920
three million taels a year.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.440
Only three million taels?

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.240
Lord Rui dares to offer so little?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.960
Fruit sales profit,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.840
Pingxiang

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.320
gets thirty percent.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.560
Huanghuali

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.760
crafted by our skilled artisans,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.400
after labor costs

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.680
and other expenses,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.400
Pingxiang gets forty percent profit.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.480
Ling An shows its grandeur.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.000
Pingxiang each year

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.240
can earn at least

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.720
forty million taels of silver.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.520
Lord Rui,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.760
don't just talk about benefits.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.480
What are your terms?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.000
Once the trade route is built,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.280
Ling An

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.760
will station envoys

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.720
to manage merchants at each checkpoint.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.080
Additionally,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.240
besides local grain,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.760
forty percent yearly

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.480
must be bought from Ling An.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.920
A ten-year contract.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.160
Wishful thinking!

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.000
Letting Ling An control the trade route—

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
in the end,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.240
it's just a way to control us with grain.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200
I just said

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.560
I didn't want to discuss this.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.040
I didn't say I wouldn't.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.560
Everything

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.480
is up to the Prince of Pingxiang.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.480
I believe Pingxiang

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.760
should be ruled by its Prince.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.800
Our nation will offer

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.640
forty million taels of silver yearly

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.280
to open mutual trade with Pingxiang.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.720
It's a gift for the Prince's succession.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.800
No one else is involved.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.480
Thank you, Your Majesty of Ling An.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.680
Your Highness,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.760
mutual trade is a good thing.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.960
But control of the trade route

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.000
must not be given up.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.080
Otherwise, if war breaks out,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.320
won't Ling An lead us by the nose again?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.960
Duke Fushan, rest assured.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.000
Our Majesty is benevolent at heart.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.560
He does not wish for the people

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.080
to suffer needless calamities.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.440
Once Ling An and Pingxiang sign the alliance treaty,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.600
a century of peace will be secured.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.960
I've heard enough of these official words.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.600
It's just one thing to your face,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.440
and another behind your back.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720
Why are you laughing?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.520
I'm laughing at the Regent.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.280
Such pointless caution.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.280
If Ling An truly wanted to attack Pingxiang,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.880
why would we send me as envoy?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.120
Besides,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.040
how could Pingxiang even fight Ling An?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.720
Has the Regent forgotten

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.640
how our General of Pacification, Nan Xingxiao,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.040
forced your troops back thirty li?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.960
You dared not face him in battle.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.040
Nan Xingxiao has been dead nearly twenty years.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.880
Ling An now values scholars over warriors.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.360
There is no one left to use.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.080
Pingxiang

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.240
need not be constrained by you anymore.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.120
If Ling An does not fight,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.480
Pingxiang could well fight.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.840
Does the Regent think

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.760
with just twenty percent of Qian Yuan's grain

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.880
you could challenge Ling An?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.800
That's just short-sighted.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.040
Ling An has thrived for a century.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.640
Talents emerge one after another.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.360
You try to fight with such outdated intelligence.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.800
In the end, all you'll get

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.880
is to run out of ammunition and provisions.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.320
Your nation's land

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.960
will be trampled by Ling An's cavalry.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.960
You'll only regret it then.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.160
It'll be too late.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.240
Why not just now

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.320
open your borders wide

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.960
and hand over your capital

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.680
without resistance?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.880
How dare you!

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.920
Your Highness,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.160
you were drunk yesterday.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.240
This is a court meeting,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.720
not a banquet at your manor.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.920
Or do you

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
want to liven things up with sword dancing?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.280
How pedantic.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.240
Step aside.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.880
Forming an alliance benefits both nations.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.800
But giving Ling An full control of the trade route

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
letting foreign envoys oversee key routes—

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.240
I could not sleep soundly.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.720
Better to have both nations station people together.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.560
As for repairs and route selection,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.520
Ling An will have to handle that.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.520
That was my oversight.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.160
The Prince of Pingxiang

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240
is more thoughtful.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.080
Since we've opened mutual trade,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.760
envoys will inevitably visit each other.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.480
But right now,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.640
the procedures are far too complicated.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.240
Regent, please

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.920
revise and discuss them again.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.800
Then submit a memorial to the palace.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.320
If I wish to meet, I will.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.520
If not, the Ministry of Rites will receive you.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.200
The palace guards will also be changed.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.080
We'll discuss this after Lord Rui leaves.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.480
We'll close the doors and talk.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.760
Since

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.800
mutual trade is settled,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640
I will soon

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.080
set out to return home.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.760
I'll arrange all necessary matters.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.960
Draft the state document and affix the seal.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.920
Conclude the alliance treaty.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.640
You're awake.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.520
How do you feel?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240
Much better.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.400
The medicine is bitter.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.080
Have a candied fruit.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.760
So now I

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.880
owe you my life.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.280
I truly don't know

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.960
how to repay this favor.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.760
Just owe it for now.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.200
There will be plenty of chances later.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.000
Are you truly dissatisfied

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.000
with His Majesty?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.760
I...

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.440
Honestly, I can't say if I'm satisfied or not.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.360
Since he took the throne,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.240
he has implemented many new policies.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.680
But the previous Emperor's unfairness to generals

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.000
is hard to erase.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.000
None of this has changed to this day.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
Even if Lord Rui

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.560
tries to bridge civil and military relations,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.480
military officers are still wronged.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.000
They get accused of all sorts of crimes.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.240
If one day

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.200
His Majesty lets generals

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.120
regain their rightful place,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.120
and gives them the fairness they deserve,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.680
would you change your view of him?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.560
I'm always clear about favors and grudges.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.360
If he truly proves he's not like his father,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.120
and is a wise ruler,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.640
I will naturally change my opinion.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.560
I seem a bit hungry now.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.320
You've just cleared the toxins.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.280
I'll make you some porridge and light dishes.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.120
A few days of care and you'll recover.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.520
But Master Yu

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.520
wants me to learn all the herbs in three days.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.280
I'll pick them and show you.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.520
So I owe you even more.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.640
I can't repay it all at once.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.400
Can I pay you back in parts?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280
I told you,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.200
there will be plenty of chances later.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.000
Rest well first.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.280
I'll go make you some food.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.680
I wonder how they're doing.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.440
Wait until tomorrow.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.320
I'll hand this to Hou Xian.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.640
Then we can return to Ling An.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.520
What about the Princess?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.920
With this alliance treaty,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.520
the Qian Yuan marriage alliance threat

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.840
won't trouble us anymore.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.800
We can finally go home.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.200
Master Rui,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.240
you truly dominated today.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880
Watching you,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.080
I was fired up!

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.640
Honestly,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.000
I was a bit nervous

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.560
in my heart back then.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.200
It concerned both nations,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.120
so I worried something might go wrong.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.400
My palms were sweating.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800
I thought you feared Hou Qi's sword.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.000
That sword,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.360
I wasn't afraid of it.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.320
Why not?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.760
Because I knew

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.520
you were behind me.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.360
Are you afraid now?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.000
Not exactly afraid.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.720
Just waiting for both nations

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.120
to exchange state documents,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.040
and start building the trade route,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.000
then I'll truly feel at ease.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.400
They say a hug brings comfort.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400
Want to try it?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.200
I...

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.680
Maybe not.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.120
Just try it.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.760
Just once.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.600
I know you bear the Rui family's future.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.760
And Your Majesty's expectations.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.640
I only wish to support you,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.840
not be a burden.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.880
As for being husband and wife,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.880
I won't force you.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.720
Let's take it slow.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.280
I trust you.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.000
Don't follow me.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.280
Princess!

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.520
Be careful.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.280
Princess...

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.880
Please stop making a fuss.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.040
I don't care.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.920
Storybooks are all lies.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.480
Nothing I like is real.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.280
No one likes me.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.400
I...

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.640
Might as well agree to a marriage alliance.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.760
Qian Yuan prince, Prince of Pingxiang—

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.480
Come on!

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.760
Whoever marries me, I'll marry them!

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.760
Oh my god...

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.000
How much did you drink?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.480
Who let her drink?

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.280
She wanted wine after her nap.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.760
Who dares refuse her?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.000
What's wrong with the Princess?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.160
Brother Yu!

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.640
You came at the right time.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.920
You decide for my royal brother.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.520
I want to stay

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.360
in Pingxiang for a marriage alliance.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.640
Isn't the Prince of Pingxiang quite young?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.160
I'll marry him!

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.640
He's only fourteen.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.640
He's not even your generation.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.160
Can you sober up?

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.160
Older women are a treasure.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.000
Isn't Pingxiang poor?

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.360
If I marry for alliance,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.240
won't he

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.600
gain a mountain of gold?

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.360
Oh my god...

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.280
Wicked fox!

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.400
Write to Wang Guanshan now.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.240
Tell him to write me

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.480
a play about the Princess's marriage alliance.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.520
Let me

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.480
be remembered for ages!

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.760
Rui Wang,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.880
the trouble you caused,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.920
you fix it.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.640
I...

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.280
Fine.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.400
While you're drunk,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.040
you'll forget by morning.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.600
I'll come clean.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.280
I am Wang Guanshan.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.120
What other story do you want?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.360
Just say it all at once.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.760
I won't write it anyway.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.800
I want you to live in your imagination.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.280
What's wrong with imagination?

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.000
Without imagination,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.280
we're just walking corpses.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.760
Tell me,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.520
who are you?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.400
I'm your fox ancestor!

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.160
Your ance—

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.160
Princess...

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.880
She's your responsibility now.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.280
What do you mean, my responsibility?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360
Let's rest too.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.400
Let's go.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.400
About earlier...

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.400
Next time.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.480
We'll continue next time.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.880
Farewell, farewell.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.880
You all...

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.640
Stinky fox!

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.360
Wicked fox!

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.240
You're up.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.880
Are you still feeling unwell?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.240
I'm all better now.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.040
Let me help you.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.760
Perfect timing.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.640
I need to help Aunt Wang dry cured meat in the village.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.240
Just lay out these herbs.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.560
I'll go with you then.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.160
What about these herbs?

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.760
True.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.760
You go, I'll do the drying.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.760
I'm heading out then.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.680
I've saved you food, remember to eat.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.480
Be careful on the road.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.840
It's been ages since I played chess.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.600
Any

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.600
interest?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.680
Sure.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.800
You've been on this mountain for days.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.920
Aren't you worried about your mother's illness?

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.560
It's because I'm worried.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.400
So I want to pass your test.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.920
To cure my mother's illness.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.320
My test—

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.040
I'm afraid you'll never pass it.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.160
Why?

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.240
Your mother—

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.920
Her name is Guo Yu, right?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.080
She was once My Queen.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.440
Daughter of the famed Duke of Dingguo.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.080
Now the Queen Mother.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.640
Actually, your mother's illness is like Lady Nan's.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.400
It's not hard to cure.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.960
Back in those days,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.440
she and the Previous Emperor

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.880
were young and in love.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.600
They shared joys and hardships.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.840
Truly enviable.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.800
My mother has mentioned it before.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.440
You served at my father's side

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.120
as his strategist for many years.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.280
After helping him become emperor,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.800
you resigned your post

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.080
and retired.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.320
I suppose

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.320
it was due to political differences

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.680
with my father.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.120
I understand.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.600
Follow this prescription.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.080
Your mother will recover with this medicine.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.800
But a few herbs are quite rare.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.680
With your skills,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.760
finding them shouldn't be hard.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.920
I don't agree with my father's politics either.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.080
I've tried to make up for it all these years.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.320
A good minister can mend things.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.560
So I hope

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.040
Master,

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.160
you and I can resolve our differences.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.280
I've lived in seclusion for years.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.800
The grudges of the world

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.440
no longer concern me.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.320
But as for Miss Youyi,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.480
you shouldn't deceive her.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.600
I don't care about your reasons

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.680
or your motives.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.240
If you truly care for her,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.880
treat her well.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.040
Show some sincerity as a man.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.360
I admit

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.400
defeat.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.080
Your Highness.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.000
Your Highness.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.520
The Ling An group has already—

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920
Old fool!

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.160
I

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.960
will take your command soon enough.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440
Has Rui Yu's group left?

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.440
They've already left.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.600
Rui Yu is deeply cunning.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.920
A skilled orator.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.680
He settled trade between two nations in a few words.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.920
This young man

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.760
is truly talented.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.920
If he returns to Ling An,

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.240
he'll be Pingxiang's greatest threat.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.440
You mean—

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.960
Send some men to watch them.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.680
Wait until they've left the pass.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.200
Yes, Your Highness.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.040
I think I drank fake wine yesterday.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.320
Why do I feel so awful?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.320
Princess.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.880
How about some tea?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.240
I feel like I forgot something important.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.680
Let me think.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.160
What was it?

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.680
I dreamed of Wang Guanshan.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.920
But in the dream, Wang Guanshan scolded me.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.880
When I tried to retort,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.800
I couldn't say a word.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.680
It was so frustrating!

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.360
Princess.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.600
Maybe eat something?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.560
It might help you feel better.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.200
My head...

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.600
My head—my head can't move.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.000
Come here, let me lean on you.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.440
Come here, let me lean on you.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.960
Master, it's time to eat.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.440
Where's Young Master Lin?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.600
I gave him the prescription.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.960
He went down the mountain.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.800
What?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.000
Weren't you going to test him more?

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.360
Do you know who he is?

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.760
He is—

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.480
Young Master Lin from the Hanlin Academy.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.000
He lied to you.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.320
He's not who he claims to be.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.200
How could that be?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.600
I advise you

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.680
to cut all ties with him.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.440
Settle all grudges.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.360
So you won't get dragged into pointless strife.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.680
Even if you must break it off,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.240
he shouldn't have left without a word.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.760
I'll go find him now.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.960
Roving bandits!

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.640
Be careful!

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.800
Why are there bandits here?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.320
Pingxiang's border has always been unstable.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.760
Now with royal infighting,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.160
it's even more chaotic.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.760
Get the Princess out of here!

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.520
Chongming!

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.480
Go with your second brother.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.520
Make sure they're safe.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:48.960
Yes.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.600
You all go together.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.360
You go too.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.200
Then be careful, all of you.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.480
Let's go.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.000
Hurry!

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.840
Yes, sir!

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.160
Go!

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.040
Princess!

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.040
Liang Jin!

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.880
Sit tight.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.680
Giddy-up!

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.360
Giddy-up!

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.400
Careful!

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.200
Rui Yu!
