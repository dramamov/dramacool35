WEBVTT

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.610
Die!

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.580
A person like you doesn't
deserve to live. Die!

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.880
And give you the satisfaction?
Why should I die?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.850
My son... Why did you do that to my Ho Se?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.090
Why? Just why?

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.690
He should've known better than to reach
for something he couldn't have.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.500
Was some poor artist ever going
to be good enough for my Kyung Chae?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.770
He should have known his place!

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.570
How dare you say that!

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.640
You really think you can take me down?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.210
I don't regret a thing I did.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.080
If I had to do it all over again,
I'd do the same exact thing.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.350
Your son?

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.450
He'd die by my hands all over again!

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.130
You jerk! Just die!

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.290
Madam Jang!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.230
Please stop!

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.070
- You have to stop!
- Let go of me!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.640
This makes you no better
than he is, Madam Jang.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.310
Why can't you see that
fighting fire with fire isn't the answer?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.810
This is all that monster's fault!

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.280
This is all Min Doo Sik's karma!

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.780
That's why what happened
to Se Ri and Mi So happened!

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.990
Tae Kyung, don't try to stop me!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.090
Don't stop me! You, of all people,
should understand how I feel.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.690
- Die!
- Madam Jang.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.030
Madam Jang!

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.970
I know. But please don't do this.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.240
For your son's sake, you can't do this.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.040
His mother becoming a murderer
on his account.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.470
No son would ever want that.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.800
You don't even have the guts to kill me.
All bark and no bite.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.100
It wasn't my karma, it was yours.
Your son's fate is your own doing.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
Get it?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.880
Even if I'm not the one to do it,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.120
my son will never let you
get away with this!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.990
You just wait, Min Doo Sik.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.790
You will truly face divine retribution!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.560
This woman's completely lost her mind.
She's insane!

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.260
If I were facing divine retribution,
would I have woken up?

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.960
Would I be able to talk like this?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.870
This isn't divine retribution.
It's a blessing, a gift from the skies.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.110
You think you can get revenge?
On me, Min Doo Sik, of all people?

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.840
What a joke.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.640
So the two of you ganged up
to try and take me down.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.280
But in the end,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.550
no matter what you do,
you're no match for me.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.990
Having the nerve to barge in here
and try to kill me.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.120
I'll make you pay for that very soon.
Just you wait.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.760
Let's go.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.100
Let's go, Madam Jang.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.840
You two are dead meat!

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.720
(Episode 112)

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.990
How did you know where I was?

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.560
Tae Joo told me.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.660
He said he couldn't just stand by
and watch something happen to you.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.430
It would have been difficult for him
to intervene himself.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.070
Madam Jang.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.540
I know exactly how you're feeling
right now.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.010
Who would understand better than me?

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.480
My parents died the exact same way
your son did.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.590
Back then, Chairman Min Doo Sik
also used a patsy to take the fall...

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.090
for the accident
and covered up his own crime.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.930
I found that driver a while ago
and asked him to testify in court,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.130
but when Chairman Min found out,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.060
he had the driver eliminated too.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.470
Right. Jo Pil Doo.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.370
- Lucia mentioned that once.
- Madam Jang.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.170
Believe me, I've wanted to wring his neck
more than once.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.410
I've even thought about hiring someone
to make him disappear without a trace...

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.680
more times than I can count.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.480
Then why didn't you?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.910
I already told you.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480
Because then, I'd be no better than him.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.820
My parents wouldn't want me
to ruin my own life...

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.520
just to get revenge on a monster like him.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.560
So what now? Are we just going to
let that monster walk free?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.860
No.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.060
He has to be punished, no matter what.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.300
We'll drag him into court,
expose every crime he's ever committed,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.070
and make sure he gets the punishment
he deserves.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.580
(Mingang Distribution)

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.180
Why do you keep calling me when I'm busy?

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.450
Are you really going to be like this?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.160
- So, you're trying to see who wins this?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.330
I was working with the Legal Team,
carrying out my tasks faithfully.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.430
You're the one who dragged me out here.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.560
Is this really how you want to end
things with me?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.900
- After all the years we've been together?
- The years we've been together?

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.070
- I guess it wasn't a short time.
- Exactly.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.980
Who made you, a total nobody,
the head of the Legal Team?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.050
And I repaid you with my complete loyalty.
Every time you were in a crisis,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.680
I did whatever it took.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.090
That's why you ended up engaged to me.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.320
So that should have been enough.
Why the change of heart now?

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.520
I seem to recall you being the one
who called off the engagement.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.260
So you pick now, of all times,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.890
when I need you more than ever,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.100
to stab me in the back
to be with Soo Jung?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.800
With the shareholders' meeting so close?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.100
What's that got to do with me?
It's not my problem.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.640
You'll have to figure it out on your own.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.210
I'm sure you'll handle the meeting fine.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.440
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.220
So, were you able to stop the mishap?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.120
I barely managed to stop it.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.820
But I'm worried about Madam Jang.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.990
She'll pull through.
She's a very strong woman.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.000
And Tae Joo will be right by her side
to take care of her.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.800
Now that Chairman Min Doo Sik knows
who Madam Jang and I really are,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.400
he's not going to just stand by
and do nothing.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.870
The only reason he hasn't acted is
because he can't move freely right now.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.910
How's his condition?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.450
He regained consciousness a while ago
and can communicate,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.850
but he's still paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.290
But he's tough as nails.
Once he recovers from the paralysis...

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.390
and can move freely again,
things will change.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.690
He'll stop at nothing
to silence Madam Jang and me.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.960
Madam Jang has Tae Joo to protect her.
You're the one in real danger, Tae Kyung.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.030
There's no telling
when or how he'll come after you.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.800
Don't worry about me.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.010
I can handle myself in a fight.
Remember Kim Sun Jae?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.880
Didn't I beat him to a pulp
with this very fist?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.110
Don't joke around.
I'm worried sick about you,

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.650
and you're cracking jokes?

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.820
I can take care of myself.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.990
Let's just prepare
for the upcoming shareholders' meeting.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.290
We need to figure out how to stop them
from ousting you.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.830
If that doesn't work,
then I'll have to play my final card.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.260
Your final card?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
Chairman?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.730
What took you so long?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.140
I only just found out you were awake.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.840
Your eldest daughter spirited you away
and hid which hospital you were in.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.180
How was I supposed to know where you were?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.880
You're here now. It's fine.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.750
There's something I needed to tell you.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.220
Watch out for Madam Jang
and Moon Tae Kyung.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.150
They're both deceiving you.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.920
What?

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.960
- What do you mean by that?
- It's a long story.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.230
Anyway, those two have conspired
and will get revenge on me.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.360
Revenge? What are you talking about?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.460
Why would they possibly want
revenge on you?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.630
That's why I'm saying they're crazy.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.900
Moon Tae Kyung declared war on me,
saying he'd see me prosecuted.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.140
He did?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.580
I'm worried about you, Chairman,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.540
but the company
is in just as much trouble.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.080
What's wrong with the company?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.980
You're doing great as acting chairman.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.180
I think there's going to be
a shareholders' meeting soon.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.620
Your eldest daughter called for it.
She wants to oust me.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.360
I kicked that brat Kyung Chae
out of the CEO position.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.890
I had to reappoint her.
She blackmailed me. I had no choice.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.660
She's running rampant,
not even knowing you've woken up.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.330
Who does she think she is,
trying to oust you?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.940
Don't worry. As long as I'm around,
that's not going to happen.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.740
I don't have enough of a stake,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.040
and my position is so unstable.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.080
I guess Kyung Chae still looks down on me.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.420
What do you mean you don't have a stake?
You have the shares I gifted you.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.390
And how much is that, really?
That's exactly why this is happening.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.790
In a situation like this,
I need a bigger stake than Kyung Chae...

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.690
if I want to command any respect.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800
She has a point.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.370
Lucia's stake is
only half of what Kyung Chae has,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.270
so I can see why
Kyung Chae looks down on her.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.870
But still, calling a shareholders' meeting
to oust her?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.110
That brat is going to treat Lucia
the same way she treated me.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.480
What if
I just give all of my shares to Lucia?

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.690
No, that might be going too far.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.190
Anyway, if I'm ever going to return
to the company,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.690
the paralysis in the legs should go away.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360
And I need to get some strength
back in my legs.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.430
Goodness.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.540
So? How do you feel?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.410
Now that you've made up your mind
and picked a side?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.010
Don't overthink it.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.620
It's not like you and my sister
were a great match anyway.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.690
And you think you and I
are a good match, Director?

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.890
I told you to stop calling me "Director."

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.960
Call me Soo Jung.
I'm a pretty cool woman, you know.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.000
Are you seriously thinking
about marrying me?

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.770
I don't see why not.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.570
Why?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.640
Sun Jae,
you don't like the idea of marrying me?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.170
This would be a first, wouldn't it?

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.440
Jumping from one sister to the next
for marriage.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.040
So what?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.980
All that matters is
that we're okay with it.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.550
Come on,
let's go to my place for another drink.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.190
Hey, what's going on with you two?

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.090
It's a look that's easy to misinterpret.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.560
Why are a man and his fiancee's sister
walking in arm in arm?

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.000
We're dating, Ji Seop.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.630
What are you talking about?
What about Kyung Chae?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.170
The two of you were engaged!

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800
We broke off the engagement.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440
You broke it off?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.840
When? And even if you did,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.610
you can't just get together with Soo Jung,
can you?

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.180
Come on. Don't be so old-fashioned.
Times have changed.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.550
What do you mean "times have changed?"
We still live in a society with morals.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.960
Just a while ago, you were about to become
brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.960
Does it make sense to go from in-laws
to lovers overnight?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.660
Goodness, my dear mother-in-law.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.230
It's been a while. Have you been well?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.640
Your future son-in-law
is here to pay his respects.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.740
My partner may have changed,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.640
but either way,
I'm still your son-in-law, right?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.290
What is all this drama?
This isn't some animal kingdom.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.700
Did Sun Jae really just jump
from Kyung Chae to Soo Jung?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.500
Give me a second. I'm so shocked
that I feel like getting sick.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.310
Good thing your father's in a coma.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.940
Imagine if he found out about this.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.880
Even I'm absolutely floored.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.180
When did he even break the engagement off
with Kyung Chae,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.880
and when did he and Soo Jung
become a thing?

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.090
Sun Jae is quite the player.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.320
Player, my foot!

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.420
That jerk thinks he can
walk all over our family.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.390
How can he just jump
from one sister to the other?

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.670
What on earth is going on?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.200
Why is he with Ms. Soo Jung?

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.140
Did you really break off the engagement?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.610
So it seems.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.310
But still, with Ms. Soo Jung?
How is that even possible?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.120
Sun Jae...

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.920
wants you to remove the engagement ring
and get rid of it immediately.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.190
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.660
You're taking this too far.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.760
Who's taking it too far?

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.830
He's saying he's done with you.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.200
He's saying he likes me more than you.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.340
You're the one who's clueless right now.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700
So?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.510
So you're actually going to
marry Lawyer Kim or something?

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.280
We'll get to that.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.240
Is there any reason we shouldn't?

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.410
Just stop.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.710
What do you think people will say?

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.620
Everyone knows
that Lawyer Kim and I were engaged.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.120
Since when have you ever cared
what other people think?

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.320
Knock, knock.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.820
Hey, baby. Come down and have some coffee.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.960
- I made you some coffee.
- Okay, thanks,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.800
honey.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.210
What is all this?

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.870
Ms. Kyung Chae, what is happening?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.680
Why are you letting yourself
be humiliated like this?

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.050
Goodness, how did this family end up
in such a mess?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.220
(Mingang Distribution)

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.690
So when Kim Sun Jae
went to the house yesterday,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.530
he was basically showing his hand.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.800
I think he's putting on a deliberate act
in front of the family.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.070
Figures. You did reject him,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.200
and Min Kyung Chae also ditched him.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.640
I guess he has nowhere else to turn.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.710
It's also a silent threat
that he won't side with Min Kyung Chae...

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.210
at the shareholders' meeting.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.080
It's a relief that Kim Sun Jae
isn't on Min Kyung Chae's side,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.410
but their side still has
a much larger stake,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.980
so there's nothing we can do for now.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.590
I'll just have to go back
to Chairman Min and beg.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.260
He did say he would stop the meeting,
at least.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.060
Hey, Lawyer Park. What is it?

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.800
I just got a call from Chairman Min.
It looks like...

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.270
he's planning to give
all his shares to his wife.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.540
Is he? How much?

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.010
- Don't tell me he's giving all of it.
- He is.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.280
Not now, but he wouldn't have called
if he wasn't serious about it, right?

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.050
That's true.
The old man never calls for no reason.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.820
Chairman Min would rather
install his wife in the position...

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.890
than hand the chairmanship over
to CEO Min.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.990
Will you be okay?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.530
Don't worry. I'll figure out a way
to land on my feet.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960
More importantly,

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.030
when Chairman Min's secret ledger
and shell company become an issue,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.030
I need you to pull some strings
with the higher-ups.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.200
Don't tell me you're packing everything up
and skipping the country.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.940
Even if I do leave,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.040
I'm going to get what I deserve
for my loyalty to Mingang.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.820
It looks like Chairman Min is thinking...

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.020
of handing his entire stake over
to his wife if it comes to it.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.790
What are you talking about?

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.190
Isn't my dad in a coma right now?

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.020
How could someone
in his condition do that?

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.730
He's made a full recovery,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.030
and he's thinking of gifting his shares
to that woman, Lucia.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.800
I heard he sought legal counsel about it.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.930
How can he give that away?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.640
Where on earth is my dad right now?

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.770
CEO Min snuck him into a VIP room
at Hanmyeong Hospital.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.010
And she's been keeping it
a secret this whole time?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.840
But then, how did Lucia find out?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.150
That woman is more formidable
than you think.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.880
Can't you tell from what's going on?

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.820
We went as far as pretending
to be a couple in front of people.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.190
I came because I felt we should at least
be sharing this kind of information.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.700
(Mingang Distribution)

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.040
I heard Dad's at Hanmyeong Hospital.
Why did you sneak him over there?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.080
So I should've just left him with Lucia?

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.210
There's no telling what she might do.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.550
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.850
What if that old geezer
comes to his senses,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.290
grows fond of the woman at his side,
and decides to give her his stake?

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.560
As a matter of fact, it looks like
that's exactly what's about to happen.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.030
What are you talking about?

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.430
Dad's awake,
and he's already met with Lucia.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.700
He seems to be thinking
of giving his stake to Lucia.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.640
He even sought legal counsel about it.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.640
That's ridiculous!

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.810
How would she even know where to find him?

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.040
And Dad's awake?

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.510
If he were, I would've been the first one
they called.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.980
That woman is Dad's legal wife.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.820
There's nothing you can do
if she tells the medical staff...

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.880
to keep things from you.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.020
I don't know how that woman found
where Dad is,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.820
hurry and stop them
before this whole thing blows up.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.310
So, you're awake.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.310
Father, you're not really thinking...

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.110
of giving that woman
your entire stake, are you?

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.150
With the shareholders' meeting so soon,

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.120
are you really going to do
something this crazy?

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.750
Your father was on his deathbed,
and now he's finally awake.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.060
You couldn't care less, could you?

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.160
All you care about is
taking over the company.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.490
This is exactly why I'm considering
giving my stake to her.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.930
Goodness.
She cares more about Mingang than you do.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.570
She's the one who cares?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.170
Who even is she?
What has she ever done for Mingang?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.410
See? This is what I mean.
You only ever see one side of things.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.270
Do you have any idea
what kind of person Lucia is?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.640
I know you're infatuated with her,
but this is too much.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.350
How can you even think about
giving her the entire Mingang stake?

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.910
Don't even think about it.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.980
Who knows what she'll pull...

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.280
after she becomes
the majority shareholder?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.290
Can't I do what I want with my own stake?
Is that what you came here to argue about?

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.190
Anything but that. You can't do it.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.660
You'd be handing the entire company
over to her.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.460
If you don't like it,
then cancel the shareholders' meeting now.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.700
And stop trying
to kick out your stepmother.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.400
I'll be returning to the company soon,
and when I do,

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.770
she'll get her CEO position back,
and you will leave the company.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.410
And that will settle everything.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.540
Father!

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.880
I'm not going to say it again.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.840
Cancel the shareholders' meeting,
and get out of the company now.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.890
Gosh.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.730
I was worried about you,
so I came to see how you're doing.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.870
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:30.040
Shouldn't you be worried about yourself?
The shareholders' meeting is very soon.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.540
That's actually why I'm here.
I thought you should know.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.710
It's going to be called off.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.080
Chairman Min promised he would stop it.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.620
Well, good for you.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.990
You certainly have a hold on Chairman Min.
You're a natural.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.160
Please forgive Se Ri and me.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.060
Forgive?

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.900
I'm not so sure.
I don't even know how to do that.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.170
I've only ever thought about revenge.
Forgiveness never crossed my mind.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.940
Our Mi So will be so happy in the skies
to finally have a grandmother.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.850
It was always just the two of us,
so she envied friends with grandmothers.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.780
And if you're a grandmother to Mi So,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.820
then you're a mother to me.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.990
We may not be related by blood,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.760
but it's just like
how Mi So is my daughter.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.270
Mother, I was just...

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.570
What's this?

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.370
What is this woman doing here?

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.210
You should go now.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.590
Why are you meeting with that woman?

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.820
The two of you have no business
with each other anymore.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.830
If you have something to say,
say it quickly and go.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.060
Mother, why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.430
I even put up with it
when you slapped me for no reason.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.440
But you can't be meeting her
behind my back like this.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.810
Do I need your permission
to see Lucia now?

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.080
Of course you do
because she's our public enemy.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.610
So you shouldn't be dealing
with her privately.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.420
I came to discuss something,
and this is what I walk in on.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.650
Father regained consciousness,

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.390
and he wants
the shareholders' meeting canceled.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.320
He knows we plan to oust Lucia there,
so if push comes to shove,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.230
it looks like he's planning
to give her all of his shares.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.530
Then just drop it.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.570
If he's going that far, drop it.
Won't you be satisfied until she's gone?

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.400
Mother, what's gotten into you?

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.270
You hated her more. Weren't you the one
who couldn't stand the sight of her?

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.850
I'll tell Se Ri to come over.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.820
Mother, you miss Se Ri, don't you?

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.290
Hey, Se Ri?

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.190
It's your sister.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.860
You know Madam Jang's hotel, right?
Get over here now.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.090
What are you talking about?

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.530
I have to go to my part-time job in a bit.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.900
- Forget your job. I said, get over here!
- Gosh.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.940
What is wrong with you, seriously?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.840
I don't even like that old lady.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.340
Why do you keep trying to push me
and that old lady together?

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.410
That's because...

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.010
Anyway, stop complaining
and get over here on the double.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.820
Just take a taxi,
and you'll be here in no time.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.680
No. I'm going to rest a little
before I go to work.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.990
If she's so bored, tell her to go
to a senior center or something.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.560
She shouldn't be bothering someone busy.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860
Se Ri!

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.570
- Hello? Min Se Ri!
- That's enough. Stop it.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.870
And don't come here again.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.570
Mother.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.410
If you want to protect Mingang,
do it on your own.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.110
You have far more than Lucia does.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.750
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.380
If I did something to upset you...

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.780
No.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.450
It's nothing like that.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.320
I'm grateful
that you loved my son so much,

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.630
and thank you
for having my granddaughter...

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.560
without giving up until the end.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.800
- Then why?
- From now on,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.770
try to be a decent person.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.170
Don't be so greedy.
Just let things run their course.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.280
If you've done wrong,
you must pay the price,

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.110
reflect on your actions,
and become a better person.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.350
- What on earth are you talking about?
- You should go now.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.990
I'm tired. I need to lie down.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.500
So you're saying the chairman
is completely lucid?

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.500
He can move and talk and everything?

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.270
That's what she just said.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.910
The chairman is truly a blessed man.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.080
How could he just wake up perfectly fine
from that condition? It's like a miracle.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.710
He's really something else.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.750
A remarkable man, I mean.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.380
So why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.220
Apparently, he doesn't want
any visitors for a while.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.290
I can't blame him. If I were him,
I wouldn't want to see my kids either.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.890
After all, none of them went looking
for him when he collapsed.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.860
Hey. That's only because
we didn't know where he was.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.260
Anyway, now that my father is awake,
things at the company will get messy.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:22.930
The company? What now?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.040
Kyung Chae and her stepmother
are on the verge of all-out war.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.340
The shareholders' meeting will decide
who comes out on top.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.780
That's why we rushed over here today.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.610
You still have that stake, right?
The time has finally come to use it.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.120
Of course he does. Don't worry.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.890
You made him promise not to sell it
and to hold onto it tight.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.390
You said you never know what might happen.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.290
Right, honey?
You still have it safe, right?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.560
Oh, that.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.200
Of course. I've got a firm grip on it.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.700
I said I'd be a son of a dog if I sold it.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.300
That's perfect!

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.800
Then you should come
to the shareholders' meeting...

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.370
and exercise your voting rights.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.440
- Me?
- Yes.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.010
- Do I really have to be there?
- Yes.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.910
- I'm going to be very busy that day.
- Please.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.450
And he hasn't even told you
when it is yet.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.890
You're acting very suspicious.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.220
Don't tell me you've gotten
into trouble again, Oh Pan Sool.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.060
You're unbelievable. Calling me by name
in front of our son-in-law like a dog.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.630
Whatever day it is, I have a feeling
I'm going to be very busy.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.700
That's my gut feeling.
And my gut has never been wrong.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.340
That sly old fox.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.450
Why is she doing this to me now?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.180
Just why?

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.320
From the sound of it,

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.820
it seems Madam Jang
has definitely turned her back on you.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.560
You turned on me too,
so of course that old fox did too.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.560
All right then, Kim Sun Jae.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.070
Are you happy now that you've betrayed me?

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.570
Thanks to my father, my plan
to kick out Lucia is about to fail.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.040
So what now?

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.910
Why is everyone so desperate
to stab me in the back?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.560
I really don't get why
Jang Yeon Sook is doing that.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:35.130
Just a few days ago, she acted like
she'd give Se Ri the world,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.130
and now she's treating her
like a total stranger.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.040
This is our Se Ri we're talking about!

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.940
You, of all people, can't act this way!
You're her grandmother!

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.320
But Se Ri...

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.260
isn't Madam Jang's granddaughter.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.730
Her real granddaughter is someone else.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.870
And you have no idea
the two of them were switched.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.900
Knowing the truth,
how would Madam Jang take your side?

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.620
You're the only fool
who's still in the dark.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.640
What did I just hear?

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.250
The two girls...

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.950
were switched?

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.960
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.140
Lawyer Kim says our Se Ri was switched
with someone else.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.180
Manager Gong, did you know about this?

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.980
If you could just make sure Ms. Kyung Chae
never finds out about this,

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:31.750
I would be forever in your debt.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.280
He'll try to get rid of me first
since I'm the biggest thorn in their side.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.920
I told you to get rid of
that jerk Moon Tae Kyung today!

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.490
Tae Kyung is in danger!

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.860
If anything happens to him, I can't go on.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.230
