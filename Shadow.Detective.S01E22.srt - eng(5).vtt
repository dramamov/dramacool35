Got chewed out?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.120
It happens all the time.
Don't take it to heart.

Don't worry,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.650
the Inspector
definitely won't mind either.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.370
He's just

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.400
wound too tight—

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.130
never gives himself a moment to breathe.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.920
Case after case,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.120
and when there's none,
he goes out looking for them.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.380
That's no kind of life.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.470
He needs to unwind.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.990
Who knows?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.970
It might even bring him
some fresh ideas.

It's from Dong.

Why didn't he bring it himself?

What is it? Something else?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.340

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.440

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.750
There is one thing

It's delicious.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.800
You're just really hungry—

To be honest,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.920
I spend more time
at the police station than at home,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.630
so

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.480
I never bothered decorating much.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.790

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.419
Why would I?

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.080
He is Zhang Sen,
a chief physician at the SIFM

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.000
and an alumnus of yours.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.409

Of course.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.870
How else would I know

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.470
you'd be available tonight?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.880
Jasmine Restaurant has new dishes—

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.190

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.720
Alright,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.620
I wouldn't want to disobey
such a gracious invitation.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.320
How can you imprison the kites?

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.480
Because I didn't want them to fly away,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.700
I hid them all away.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.410
By now, they probably can't fly anymore.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.120
You made these?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.120
And they were this well-made even
when you were a child?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.760
I loved flying kites as a kid,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.750
but I could never get them

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.080
airborne all by myself.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.290
So I tried persuading Jingning
to join me,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.720
but she didn't like running
around in the wild.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.200
I thought I could tempt her

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.210
with pretty kites.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.480
But the store-bought ones

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.880
weren't special enough.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.330
Eventually, I decided to make my own.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.360
That's how I met Mr. Wei,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.650
and I went on to make a lot of kites
under his guidance.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.360
This sachet looks just
like the one in your car.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.420
Was it Jingning's?

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.880
Not exactly—

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.180
this one's flawed.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.930
It was her birthday,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.170
and I thought long and hard
about what to give her.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.480
In the end, I decided

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.390
to give her a sachet
that I would make myself.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.650
I knew she loved lotus,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.540
so I embroidered one on it.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.640
But my skills were
still lacking back then—

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.720
I ruined quite a few.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.080
Either the stitching was off here,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.810
or the pattern was messy there.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.730
The one Jingning received

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.600
was the most perfect of them all.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.080
She must have been
wearing it all the time.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.240
I told her

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.000
that as long as she held that sachet,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.330
no matter where she went

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.720
or what she became,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.560
I would recognize her

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.850
and find her.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.200
So from the moment she received it,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.840
she wore it constantly,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.040
never letting it leave her side.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.720
Was she

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.430
wearing it that day?

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.950
Can I take a closer look?

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.440
I'll let you take a look,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.100
but be careful—don't lose it.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.810
Okay.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.400
It's beautiful! Look at the edge here.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.070
What's wrong?

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.040
I just remembered something.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.840
Stop thinking about it.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.000
I can't recall more.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.790
I just can't.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.790
You don't need
to keep forcing yourself, Lu Yizhen.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.190
If I push a little harder,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.480
if I remember just a bit more,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.880
there might be more hope.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.600
It's fine—don't worry about me.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.730
Let me try a bit more.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.960
Don't think about it anymore.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.180
It's all over.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.160
That was so long ago.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:46.870
It's okay.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.120
Are you feeling better now?

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.670
If you're still unwell,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.270
we should go to the hospital.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.530
I don't want to go to the hospital.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.600
There's somewhere else
I'd rather go.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.790
Are you sure you're okay?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.630
I'm fine.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.910
I just overdid it
with the thinking earlier,

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.440
so I have a bit of a headache.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.120
Really?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.910
Really.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.150
Ready now?

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.980
Wait,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.200
let me apply a bit more.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.000
Just worried I might accidentally
hurt you later.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.670
Are you looking down on me?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.360
It's not about looking down on you—

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.890
it's about knowing myself.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.900
Well, today you'll get
to rediscover yourself.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.530
Let's go.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.910
Inspector Guan,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.750
we're heading back first.
Don't forget to lock up.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.200
Got it.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:09.920
Let's go.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.200
Come on, Lu Yizhen.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.240
Didn't you want to see
what I'm really capable of?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.310
You okay?

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.360
Lu Yizhen, you cheated!

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.840
All's fair in love and war.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.790
Get away from me.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.270
Don't choke me!

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.510
Go away!

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.030
I hate you!

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.280
Come on, Lu Yizhen.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.260
Using that move again?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.300
Lu Yizhen?

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.350
Let's call it a day, no more fighting.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:22.910
No,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.960
let's continue.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.640
We have to keep going.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.240
I recalled something just now,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.790
but not everything yet.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.290
You're the only one
who can help me.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.300
Please, help me.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.690
Take this seriously, Guan Cen.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.360
Come on!

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.680
Yizhen.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.000
Lu Yizhen,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.240
are you okay?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.270
Lu Yizhen,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440
are you all right?

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.630
Lu Yizhen.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.510
I saw Jingning get hurt...

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.900
I'm so scared.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:19.530
It's okay.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.600
It's okay.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.160
I'm here.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.500
Don't be afraid, Lu Yizhen.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.360
No matter what happens,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.610
I'll always stand by your side.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.920
Lu Yizhen.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.900
It's alright.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.000
It's alright.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.840
It's okay. It's okay.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.380
[Yong Kang]

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.960
Feeling better now?

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.050
I'll take you home in a bit.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.470
Make sure you get
some proper rest tonight.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.640
I don't want to be alone.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.440
Stay with me, please.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.560
When I saw you carrying
that old flint striker last time,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.170
I was really surprised.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.730
Who carries something like that around?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160
It's just a habit.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.180
When Jingning was little,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.510
our family often went
on outings together.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.540
But she was afraid of the dark,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.830
so we'd always

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.770
light a bonfire nearby.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.210
Later, after Jingning...

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.550
My mother was heartbroken

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.760
and shut herself indoors.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.240
My father couldn't bear staying
in this place full of memories

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.500
and left for Hong Kong.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.800
I moved out and lived alone.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.530
After that, our family
rarely saw each other,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.810
and no one ever brought up outings again.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.400
But I kept the habit.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.200
My family always stayed together,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.750
but we never went on outings.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.010
My parents thought

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.960
I'd get hurt whenever I went out,

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.330
so they never let me leave the house.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.200
They finally agreed to let me
go out with Si Min once,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.130
and… well, you know what happened.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.790
After that,

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.760
they watched me even more closely—

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.720
never let me out of their sight

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.960
for a second.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.940
I didn't really have friends either.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.830
Looking back now,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.810
those years were incredibly lonely.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.150
Do you still feel lonely now?

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.640
Now I have you—

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.250
how could I be lonely?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.720
I'm truly

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.040
content.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.960
This is the life
I've always wanted:

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.790
doing work I love,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.400
having friends around,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.200
and still learning new things.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.820
See, I even get to learn

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.970
little forensic tricks from Dr. Ding.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.960
When I first joined the police station,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.110
I actually thought you and Dr. Ding

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.750
had some kind of romantic history.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.610
I never expected

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.210
she'd try to set me up with...

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.480
With who?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.960
With you.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.720
Aren't you cold?

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.820
I'm not cold.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.260
What about you?

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.600
Do you feel lonely?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160
I've never really thought about it.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.030
I used to live

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.350
for one purpose.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.920
I thought

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.040
there were only two possible endings
for my life:

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.900
if Jingning was alive,

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.130
I'd spend it searching for her;

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.590
if she was dead,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.330
I saw no reason to keep living.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.310
But now, I have a new purpose.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.310
Don't talk about living or dying—

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.520
please don't say things like that.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.360
You have to live well.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.680
Run!

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.410
Hurry! Hurry!

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.590
What's wrong?

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:04.630
Lu Yizhen.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.960
Here.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:08.330
Take it.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.790
Ghost,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.970
you're on delivery duty today.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.810
But it's my day off.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.410
The guy's sick.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.000
Boss said you're
to deliver the kids to Mr. Jin.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.640
Now hurry.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.720
Search them

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.690
and make them change clothes
before shipping.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.510
This is the place!

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.170
After them!

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.110
Stop! Don't move! Stop right there!

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.350
Halt!

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.510
Freeze!

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.350
Wake up.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.590
Wake up.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.590
Come on,

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.650
open your eyes.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.830
Wake up.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.920
Nightmare?

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.060
I remember now.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.810
I remember everything.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.450
You're the one who saved me.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.020
You remember that?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.510
I also recalled

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.320
something about Jingning.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.240
Mr. Jin.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.640
Mr. Jin?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.400
Mr. Jin.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.510
So you're saying

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.200
the deceased Bao Yiming in prison

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.270
was likely murdered by Tang Jiahao.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.450
But he couldn't

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.750
have pulled this off alone—

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.010
there must be someone behind the scenes.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.640
Can you remember

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.600
anyone else?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.500
Perhaps Gu Sinian?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.640
I don't recall anything

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.750
about Gu Sinian.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.200
Jingning and I were almost out

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.800
when Tang Jiahao showed up.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.800
He took Jingning,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.510
and I was

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.510
saved by Bao Yiming—Ghost.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.380
Why would he save you?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.610
"Save" might not be the right word.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.550
I think he was after

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.010
the note hidden in my shoe.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.080
You mean it belonged to him?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.170
Do you remember what it was?

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.000
I never opened it,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.590
but I suspect

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.920
it had something to do
with Skylark Company.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.120
Why else would he risk hiding it with me?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.720
Then we'll have to wait for Ding Eryi

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.520
to solve that part of the puzzle.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.910
What about Jingning?

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.890
Jingning and I were so close to escaping,

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.040
but Tang Jiahao showed up too quickly.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.840
There's too much information at once—

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.240
I need to sort through it.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.830
If your memories

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.680
don't include Gu Sinian,

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.130
where do we even start?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.070
There's one name

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.830
that might be connected
to Jingning's whereabouts.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.680
What's the name?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.400
Mr. Jin.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.270
Mr. Jin...

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.450
That sounds really familiar.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.920
Both you and Guan Cen

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.210
must be struggling,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.300
suddenly remembering everything.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.200
To be honest,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.130
I don't know what I'm supposed
to feel when I face him.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.080
Jingning is still missing,

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.920
yet I managed to escape.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.920
I'll pull

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.780
all missing persons cases

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.300
and population records

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.720
from the Intelligence Department
as soon as possible.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.480
But

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.830
it's a lot of data—

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.100
a thorough review will take time.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.100
I understand.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.720
I'm counting on you.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.440
I'll also keep digging

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.680
into this "Mr. Jin" lead

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.400
and update you the moment I find anything.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:29.930
Alright.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.760
Stay close to him these days.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.350
He may seem tough,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.750
but he's fragile inside.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.960
Right now, he needs you.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.730
I'm different, though—

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.760
I've been through the wringer.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.040
I'm hardened now.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.550
And of course,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.450
you gave the crank a few turns.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.510
Alright, you should get going now.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.310
I'm off, then.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.400
All these years,

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.550
I've braced

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.750
for the worst,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.720
over and over.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.220
Now it feels strange—

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.990
I thought I could endure it,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.030
but I couldn't.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.070
There's only

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.230
a quiet relief,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.320
as if whatever the outcome,

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.250
I can finally make peace with it.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.210
I understand.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.070
I can't stop thinking about

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.030
Jingning back then, holding that sachet,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.400
believing I'd come for her...

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.260
and I never did.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.490
How helpless she must have felt.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.070
I'm sorry.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.710
You don't need to apologize.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.960
You lived through it—

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.240
if anyone should be sorry, it's me.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.480
If I hadn't lost my memory,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.650
you wouldn't have suffered
all these years.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.640
Maybe not remembering
was a kindness.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.310
It was precisely because you forgot

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.780
that you granted me

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.210
an oasis that was never there.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.110
Besides,

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.210
you survived the nightmare—

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.450
if you remembered everything,

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.680
you'd have

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.750
relived that pain again and again.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.110
I was wrong before,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.450
trying to trade your suffering

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.000
for clues about Jingning.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.960
But I soon realized...

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.760
that wasn't what I truly wanted.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.350
You will never have to endure

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.750
the pain of losing someone
like that again.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.750
I promise you.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.060
Director Wang.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.010
You're here.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.850
Perfect timing—

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.540
I've just made some progress.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.180
Where's Dr. Ding?

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.040
I don't see her.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.350
She's not in today—
it's her day off.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.750
Do you need her for something?

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.150
No, no, I was just asking.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.900
You're truly remarkable.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.790
To restore it to this state

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.050
in such a short time...

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.640
It all comes down to experience
accumulated over the years.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.070
I've handled evidence

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.060
in even worse condition before.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.070
Thank you for your efforts,
Director Wang.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.800
Don't mention it—it's my duty.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.970
It's just... the writing here
is no longer legible.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:01.960
True.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:02.920
But

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.590
that doesn't mean it's impossible

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.480
to decipher.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.960
I've started reconstructing the characters
by their stroke traces—

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.110
some are obvious

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.720
at a glance,

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.180
while others require educated guesses.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.440
Give me a little more time.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.840
I'll have it sorted soon.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.220
Thank you for your hard work.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.260
I've found the "Mr. Jin"
you've been looking into.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.510
Back when we were young,

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.440
he was already

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.110
a prominent figure in Shanghai—

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.590
involved in shady dealings,

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.720
connected on both sides of the law,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.920
and thriving in the city's underworld.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.680
Then how come

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.080
we've never heard of him?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.500
Because he nearly got arrested years ago.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.110
No one knew exactly
what he was involved in,

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.780
but shortly after his arrest,

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:41.720
he was released

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.450
and vanished without a trace.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.510
If he vanished,

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.240
how are we supposed to find him?

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.160
You'd never guess—

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.270
there's actually someone close to us

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.110
who had dealings with him back then.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.640
Who?

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.920
Director Huo.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.590
He was the one
who arrested Mr. Jin back then.
